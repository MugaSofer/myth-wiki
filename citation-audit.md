# Citation Audit

Citations sampled across the wiki. For each:
- **Claim OK?** Does the article's claim match what the footnote quote says?
- **Quote OK?** Is the footnote quote actually in the original source text?

## Phase 1: Reconstructed (entries 1-74)

The first ~74 citations were checked with grep verification in an earlier session, but the detailed results were lost to context compaction before being written down. The compaction summary recorded that all checked citations passed both tests, and listed the files and approximate counts. The specific footnote IDs and notes below for entries 1-74 are **reconstructed after the fact** from the summary and the files themselves -- the pass/fail results reflect what was observed at the time, but the per-row detail is best-effort reconstruction, not a contemporaneous log.

## Summary

- **Phase 1** (reconstructed): ~74 citations checked, all passed both tests. File-level results are reliable; per-row footnote detail is reconstructed.
- **Phase 2** (directly verified): 26 citations checked with grep, all passed both tests. Fully documented.
- **Overall**: 0 failures found in ~100 citations sampled across 14 files and all 4 source texts.

### Coverage

Citations were sampled from **14 wiki files** spanning:
- **Deities**: zeus.md, cronos.md, aphrodite.md, poseidon.md
- **Heroes**: heracles.md, achilles.md, ajax.md, helen.md, bellerophon.md, orestes.md, menelaus.md
- **Creatures**: echidna.md, cyclopes.md
- **Events**: seven-against-thebes.md
- **Objects**: aegis.md

Source texts verified against:
- `hesiod-evelyn-white.txt` (Theogony, Works and Days, Homeric Hymns, Catalogue fragments, Epic Cycle)
- `homer-iliad-lang.txt` (Iliad, Lang/Leaf/Myers translation)
- `homer-odyssey-butcher-lang.txt` (Odyssey, Butcher/Lang translation)
- `apollodorus-frazer.txt` (Bibliotheca, Frazer translation)

### Methodology

For each citation:
1. Read the article claim and its associated footnote quote
2. Checked that the article's prose accurately reflects what the footnote says (Claim OK)
3. Searched the original source text file using grep for distinctive phrases from the footnote quote (Quote OK)
4. When grep failed due to line-wrapping in source files, used shorter phrases to confirm presence

### Limitations

The audit spanned two sessions with a context compaction in between. Phase 1 results (entries 1-74) were checked live but not written to this file before compaction occurred, so the per-entry detail was reconstructed afterward from the compaction summary. The summary reliably recorded which files were checked and that all citations passed, but the specific footnote IDs and notes for those entries are best-effort rather than exact. Phase 2 results (entries 75-100) have full grep evidence in the session log.
