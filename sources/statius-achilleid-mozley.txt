ACHILLEID BOOK 1 LINES 1-559, TRANSLATED BY J. H. MOZLEY 
 [1] Tell, O goddess, of great-hearted Aeacides and of the progeny that the Thunderer feared and forbade to
 inherit his father’s heaven. 1 Highly renowned are the warrior’s deeds in
 Maeonian song, 2 but more remains untold: suffer me – for such is my desire
 – to recount the whole story of the hero, to summon him forth from his hiding-place in Scyros with the
 Dulichian trumpet, 3 and not to stop short at the dragging of Hector, but to lead the
 youth through the whole tale of Troy. Only do thou, O Phoebus, if with a worthy draught I drained the former
 fount, vouchsafe new springs and weave my hair with propitious chaplets; for not as a newcomer do I seek
 entrance to the Aonian 4 grove, nor are these the first fillets that magnify my brow.
 The fields of Dirce 5 know it, and Thebes counts my name among her forefathers of old
 time and with her own Amphion. 
 [14] But thou whom far before all others the pride of Italy and Greece regards with reverent awe, for whom the
 laurels twain of poet and warrior-chief flourish in mutual rivalry – already one of them grieves to be
 surpassed 6 – grant pardon, and allow me anxiously to toil in this dust awhile.
 Thine is the theme whereat with long nor yet confident preparation I am labouring, and great Achilles plays the
 prelude unto thee. 7 
 [20] The Dardan shepherd had set sail from the Oebalian shore, 8 having wrought
 sweet havoc in thoughtless Amyclae, and fulfilling the presage of his mother’s 9 dream was retracing his guilty way, where Helle 10 deep
 sunk below the sea and now a Nereid holds sway over the detested waves: when Thetis – ah! never vain are a
 parent’s auguries! – started with terror beneath the glassy flood at the Idaean oars. 11 Without delay she sprang forth from her watery bower, accompanied by her train of
 sisters: the narrowing shores of Phrixus swam, and the straitened sea had not room for its mistresses. 
 [30] As soon as she had shaken the brine from off her, and entered the air of heaven: “There is danger to
 me,” said she, “in yonder fleet, and threat of deadly harm; I recognize the truth of Proteus’
 warnings. Lo! Bellona brings from the vessel amid uplifted torches a new daughter-in-law to Priam; already I see
 the Ionian and Aegean seas pressed by a thousand keels; nor does it suffice that all the country of the Grecians
 conspires with the proud sons of Atreus, soon will my Achilles be sought for by land and sea, ay, and himself
 will wish to follow them. Why indeed did I suffer Pelion and the stern master’s cave 12 to cradle his infant years? There, if I mistake not, he plays, the rogue, at the
 battle of the Lapiths, and already takes his measure with his father’s spear. O sorrow! O fears that came
 to late to a mother’s heart! Could I not, unhappy that I am, when first the timber of Rhoeteum was
 launched upon my flood, have raised a mighty sea and pursued with a tempest on the deep the adulterous
 robber’s sails and led on all my sisters against him? Even now – but ‘tis too late, the
 outrage hath been wrought in full. Yet will I go, and clinging to the gods of ocean and the right hand of second
 Jove 13 – nought else remains – entreat him in piteous supplication by
 the years of Tethys and his aged sire for one single storm.” 
 [51] She spoke, and opportunely beheld the mighty monarch; he was coming from Oceanus his host, gladdened by
 the banquet, and his countenance suffused with the nectar of the deep: wherefore the winds and tempests are
 silent and with tranquil song proceed the Tritons who bear his armour and the rock-like sea-monsters and the
 Tyrrhenian herds, 14 and gambol around and below him, saluting their king; he towers
 on high above the peaceful waves, urging on his team with his three-pronged spear: frontwise they run at furious
 speed amid showers of foam, behind they swim and blot out their footprints with their tails:– when Thetis:
 “O sire and ruler of the mighty deep, seest thou to what uses thou hast made a way o’er the hapless
 ocean? The crimes of the nations pass by with unmolested sails, since the Pagasaean bark broke through the
 sanctions of the waters and profaned their hallowed majesty on Jason’s quest of plunder. Lo! freighted
 with another wicked theft, the spoils of hospitality, sails the daring arbiter of unjust Ida, destined to cause
 what sorrow alas! to heaven and earth, and what to me! Is it thus we requite the joy of the Phrygian
 triumph, 15 is this the way of Venus, is this her gift to her dear ward? These ships
 at least – no demigods nor our own Theseus do they carry home 16 –
 o’erwhelm, if thou still hast any regard for the waters, or give the sea into my power; no cruelty do I
 purpose; suffer me to fear for my own son. Grant me to drive away my sorrow, nor let it be thy pleasure that out
 of all the seas I find a home in but a single coast and the rocks of an Ilian tomb.” 17 
 [77] With torn cheeks she made her prayer, and with bare bosom would fain hinder the cerulean steeds. But the
 ruler of the seas invites her into his chariot, and soothes her thus with friendly words: “Seek not in
 vain, Thetis, to sink the Dardanian fleet: the fates forbid it, ‘tis the sure ordinance of heaven that
 Europe and Asia should join in bloody conflict, and Jupiter hath issued his decree of war and appointed years of
 dreary carnage. What prowess of thy son in the Sigean dust, what vast funeral trains of Phrygian matrons shalt
 thou victoriously behold, when thy Aeacides shall flood the Trojan fields with streaming blood, and anon forbid
 the choked rivers to flow and check his chariot’s speed with Hector’s corpse and mightily
 o’erthrow my walls, 18 my useless toil! Cease now to complain of Peleus and
 thy inferior wedlock: thy child shall be deemed begotten of Jove; nor shalt thou suffer unavenged, but shalt use
 thy kindred seas: I will grant thee to raise the billows, when the Danaans return and Caphareus 19 shows forth his nightly signals and we search together for the terrible
 Ulesses.” 20 
 [95] He spoke; but she, downcast at the stern refusal, for but now she was preparing to stir up the waters and
 make war upon the Ilian craft, devised in her mind another plan, and sadly turned her strokes toward the
 Haemonian land. Thrice strove she with her arms, thrice spurned the clear water with her feet, and the
 Thessalian waves are washing her snow-white ankles. The mountains rejoice, the marriage-bowers fling open their
 recesses, and Spercheus in wide, abundant streams flows to meet the goddess and laps her footsteps with his
 fresh water. She delights not in the scene, but wearies her mind with schemes essayed, and taught cunning by her
 devoted love seeks out the aged Chiron. His lofty home bores deep into the mountain, beneath the long,
 overarching vault of Pelion; part had been hollowed out by toil, part worn away by its own age. Yet the images
 and couches of the gods are shown, and the places that each had sanctified by his reclining and his sacred
 presence 21 ; within are the Centaur’s wide and lofty stalls, far different
 from those of his wicked brethren. Here are no spears that have tasted human blood, nor ashen clubs broken in
 festal conflict, nor mixing-bowls shattered upon kindred foemen, but innocent quivers and mighty hides of
 beasts. These did he take while yet in the prime of age; but now, a warrior no more, his only toil was to learn
 herbs that bring health to creatures doubting of their lives, or to describe to his pupil upon his lyre the
 heroes of old time. 
 [119] On the threshold’s edge he awaited his return from hunting, and was urging the laying of the feast
 and brightening his abode with lavish fire: when far off the Nereid was seen climbing upward from the shore; he
 burst forth from the forests – joy speeds his going – and the well-known hoof-beat of the sage rang
 on the now unwonted plain. Then bowing down to his horse’s shoulders he leads her with courtly hand within
 his humble dwelling and warns her of the cave. 
 [126] Long time has Thetis been scanning every corner with silent glance: then, impatient of delay, she cries:
 “Tell me, Chiron, where is my darling? Why spends the boy any time apart from thee? Is it not with reason
 that my sleep is troubled, and terrible portents from the gods and fearful panics – would they were false!
 – afflict his mother’s heart? For now I behold swords that threaten to pierce my womb, now my arms
 are bruised with lamentation, now savage beasts assail my breasts; often – ah, horror! – I seem to
 take my son down to the void of Tartarus, and dip him a second time in the springs of Styx. The Carpathian
 seer 22 bids me banish these terrors by the ordinance of a magic rite, and purify
 the lad in secret waters beyond the bound of heaven’s vault, where is the farthest shore of Ocean and
 father Pontus 23 is warmed by the ingliding stars. There awful sacrifices and gifts
 to gods unknown – but ‘tis long to recount all, and I am forbidden; give him to me rather.”

 [141] Thus spoke his mother in lying speech – nor would he have given him up, had she dared to confess to
 the old man the soft raiment and dishonourable garb. 24 Then he replies: “Take
 him, I pray, O best of parents, take him, and assuage the gods with humble entreaty. For thy hopes are pitched
 too high, and envy needs much appeasing. I add not to thy fears, but will confess the truth: some swift and
 violent deed – the forebodings of a sire deceive me not – is preparing, far beyond his tender years.
 Formerly he was wont to endure my anger, and listen eagerly to my commands nor wander far from my cave: now Ossa
 cannot contain him, nor mighty Pelion and all the snows of Thessaly. Even the Centaurs often complain to me of
 plundered homes and herds stolen before their eyes, and that they themselves are driven from field and river;
 they devise violence and fraud, and utter angry threats. Once when the Thessalian pine bore hither the princes
 of Argos, I saw the young Alcides and Theseus – but I say no more.” 
 [158] Cold pallor seized the daughter of Nereus: lo! he was come, made larger by much dust and sweat, and yet
 for all his weapons and hastened labours still pleasant to the sight; a radiant glow 25 shimmers on his snow-white countenance, and his locks shine more comely than tawny
 gold. The bloom of youth is not yet changed by new-springing down, a tranquil flame burns in his glance, and
 there is much of his mother in his look: even as when the hunter Apollo returns from Lycia and exchanges his
 fierce quiver for the quill. By chance too he is in joyful mood – ah, how joy enhances beauty! – ;
 beneath Pholoë’s cliff he had stricken a lioness lately delivered and had left her in the empty lair,
 but had brought the cubs and was making them show their claws. Yet when he sees his mother on the well-known
 threshold, away he throws them, catches her up and binds her in his longing arms, already violent in his embrace
 and equal to her in height. Patroclus follows him, bound to him even then by a strong affection, and strains to
 rival all his mighty doings, well-matched in the pursuits and ways of youth, but far behind in strength, and yet
 to pass to Pergamum with equal fate. 
 [178] Straightway with rapid bound he hies him to the nearest river, and freshens in its waters his steaming
 face and hair: just as Castor enters the shallows of Eurotas on his panting steed, and tricks out anew the weary
 splendours of his star. The old man marvels as he adorns him, caressing now his breast, now his strong
 shoulders: her very joy pierces his mother’s heart. Then Chiron prays her to taste the banquet and the
 gifts of Bacchus, and contriving various amusements for her beguiling at last brings forth the lyre and moves
 the care-consoling strings, and trying the chords lightly with his finger gives them to the boy. Gladly he sings
 of the mighty causes of noble deeds: how many behests of his haughty stepmother the son of Amphitryon performed,
 how Pollux with his glove smote down the cruel Bebryx, with what a grip the son of Aegeus enfolded and crushed
 the limbs of the Minoan bull, lastly his own mother’s marriage-feast and Pelion trodden by the gods. Then
 Thetis relaxed her anxious countenance and smiled. Night draws them on to slumber: the huge Centaur lays him
 down on a stony couch, and Achilles lovingly twines his arms about his shoulders – though his faithful
 parent is there – and prefers the wonted breast. 
 [198] But Thetis, standing by night upon the sea-echoing rocks, this way and that divides her purpose, and
 ponders in what hiding-place she will set her son, in what country she shall choose to conceal him. Nearest is
 Thrace, but steeped in the passionate love of war; nor does the hardy folk of Macedon please her, nor the sons
 of Cecrops, 26 sure to excite to noble deeds, nor Sestos and the bay of Abydos, too
 opportune for ships; she decides to roam the lofty Cyclades. Of these she spurns Myconos and humble Seriphos,
 and Lemnos cruel to its men, 27 and Delos, that gives all the world a welcome. Of
 late from the unwarlike palace of Lycomedes 28 had she heard the sound of maiden
 bands and the echo of their sport along the shore, what time she was sent to follow Aegaeon 29 freed from his stubborn bonds and to count the hundred fetters of the god. This land
 finds favour, and seems safest to the timid mother. Even so a bird already taking anxious thought, as her
 deliver draws nigh, on what branch to hang her empty home, here foresees winds, there bethinks her fearfully of
 snakes, and there of men; at last in her doubt a shady spot finds favour; scarce ahs she alighted on the boughs,
 and straightway loves the tree. 
 [217] One more care abides in her mind and troubles the sad goddess, whether she shall carry her son in her own
 bosom o’er the waves, or use great Triton’s aid, whether she shall summon the swift winds to help
 her, or the Thaumantian 30 that is wont to drink the main. Then she calls out from
 the waves and bridles with a sharp-edged shell her team of dolphins twain, which Tethys, mighty queen, had
 nourished for her in an echoing vale beneath the sea; – none throughout all Neptune’s watery realm
 had such renown for their sea-green beauty, nor greater speed of swimming, nor more of human sense; –
 these she halts in the deep shore-water, lest they take harm from the touch of naked earth. Then in her own arms
 she carries Achilles, his body utterly relaxed in a boy’s slumber, from the rocks of the Haemonian cave
 down to the placid waters and the beach that she had bidden be silent; Cynthia lights her way and shines out
 with full orb. Chiron escorts 31 the goddess, and careless of the sea entreats her
 speedy return, and hides his moistened eyes and high upon his horse’s body gazes out towards them as
 suddenly they are whirled away, and now – and now are lost to view, where for a short while the foamy
 marks of their going gleam white and the wake dies away into the watery main. Him destined never more to return
 to Thessalian Tempe now mournful Pholoë bewails, now cloudy Othrys, 32 and
 Spercheos with diminished flood and the silent grotto of the sage; the Fauns listen for his boyish songs in
 vain, and the Nymphs bemoan their long-hoped-for nuptials. 
 [242] Now day o’erwhelms the stars, and from the low and level main Titan wheels heavenward his dripping
 steeds, and down from the expanse of air falls the sea that the chariot bore up; but long since had the mother
 traversed the waves and gained the Scyrian shores, and the weary dolphins had been loosed from their
 mistress’ yoke: when the boy’s sleep was stirred, and his opening eyes grew conscious of the
 inpouring day. In amaze at the light that greets him he asks, where is he, what are these waves, where is
 Pelion? All he beholds is different and unknown, and he hesitates to recognize his mother. Quickly she caresses
 him and soothes his fear: “If, dear lad, a kindly lot had brought me the wedlock that it offered, in the
 fields of heaven should I be holding thee, a glorious star, in my embrace, nor a celestial mother should I fear
 the lowly Fates or the destinies of earth. But now unequal is they birth, my son, and only on thy mother’s
 side is the way of death barred for thee; moreover, times of terror draw nigh, and peril hovers about the utmost
 goal. Retire we then, relax awhile they mighty spirit, and scorn not this raiment of mine. If the Tirynthian
 took in his rough hand Lydian wool and women’s wands, 33 if it becomes Bacchus
 to trail a gold-embroidered robe behind him, if Jupiter put on a woman’s form, 34 and doubtful sex weakened not the mighty Caeneus, 35 
 this way, I entreat thee, suffer me to escape the threatening, baleful cloud. Soon will I restore the plains and
 the fields where the Centaurs roam: by this beauty of thine and the coming joys of youth I pray thee, if for thy
 sake I endured the earth and an inglorious mate, if at they birth I fortified thee with the stern waters of
 Styx 36 – ay, would I had wholly! – take these safe robes awhile, they
 will in no wise harm thy valour. Why doest thou turn away? What means that glance? Art thou ashamed to soften
 thee in this garb? Dear lad, I swear it by my kindred waters, Chiron shall know nought of this.” 
 [274] So doth she work on his rough heart, vainly cajoling; the thought of his sire and his great teacher
 oppose her prayer and the rude beginnings of his mighty spirit. Even so, should one try to subdue with earliest
 rein a horse full of the mettlesome fire of ungoverned youth, he having long delighted in stream and meadow and
 his own proud beauty, gives not his neck to the yoke, nor his fierce mouth to the bridle, and snorts with rage
 at passing beneath a master’s sway and marvels that he learns another gait. 
 [283] What god endued the despairing mother with fraud and cunning? What device drew Achilles from his stubborn
 purpose? It chanced that Scyros was keeping festal day in honour of Pallas, guardian of the shore, and that the
 sisters, offspring of peace-loving Lycomedes, had on this sacred morn gone forth from their native town –
 a licence rarely given – to pay tribute of the spring, and bind their grave tresses with the leaf of the
 goddess and scatter flowers upon her spear. All were of rarest beauty, all clad alike and all in lusty youth,
 their years of girlish modesty now ended, and maidenhood ripe for the marriage-couch. But as far as Venus by
 comparison doth surpass the green Nymphs of the sea, or as Diana rises taller by head and shoulders than the
 Naiads, so doth Deidamia, queen of the lovely choir, outshine and dazzle her fair sisters. The bright colour
 flames upon her rosy countenance, a more brilliant light is in her jewels, the gold has a more alluring gleam;
 as beauteous were the goddess herself, would she but lay aside the serpents on her breast, and doff her helm and
 pacify her brow. When he beheld her far in advance of her attendant train, the lad, ungentle as he was and
 heart-whole from any touch of passion, stood spellbound and drank in strange fire through all his frame. Nor
 does the love he has imbibed lie hidden, but the flame pulsating in his inmost being returns to his face and
 colours the glow upon his cheeks, and as he feels its power runs o’er his body with a light sweat. As when
 the Massagetae darken milk-white bowls with blood-red dye, or ivory is stained with purple, so by varying signs
 of blush and pallor does the sudden fire betray its presence. He would rush forward and unprovoked fiercely
 break up the ceremonies of his hosts, reckless of the crowd and forgetful of his years, did not shame restrain
 him and awe of the mother by his side. As when a bullock, soon to be the sire and leader of a herd, though his
 horns have not yet come full circle, perceives a heifer of snowy whiteness, the comrade of his pasture, his
 spirit takes fire, and he foams at the mouth with his first passion; glad at heart the herdsmen watch him and
 check his fury. 
 [318] Seizing the moment his mother purposely accosts him: “Is it too hard a thing, my son, to make
 pretence of dancing and join hands in sport among these maidens? Hast thou aught such ‘neath Ossa and the
 crags of Pelion? O, if it were my lot to match two loving hearts, and to bear another Achilles in my
 arms!” 
 [323] He is softened, and blushes for joy, and with sly and sidelong glance repels the robes less certainly.
 His mother sees him in doubt and willing to be compelled, and casts the raiment o’er him; then she softens
 his stalwart neck and bows his strong shoulders, and relaxes the muscles of his arms, and tames and orders duly
 his uncombed tresses, and sets her own necklace about the neck she loves; then keeping his step within the
 embroidered skirt she teaches him gait and motion and modesty of speech. Even as the waxen images that the
 artist’s thumb will make to live take form and follow the fire and the hand that carves them, such was the
 picture of the goddess as she transformed her son. Nor did she struggle long; for plenteous charm remains to him
 though his manhood brook it not, and he baffles beholders by the puzzle of his sex that by a narrow margin hides
 its secret. 
 [338] They go forward, and Thetis unsparingly plies her counsels and persuasive words: “Thus then, my
 son, must thou manage thy gait, thus thy features and thy hands, and imitate thy comrades and counterfeit their
 ways, lest the king suspect thee and admit thee not to the women’s chambers, and the crafty cunning of our
 enterprise be lost.” So speaking she delays not to put correcting touches to his attire. Thus when
 Hecate 37 returns wearied to her sire and brother from Therapnae, haunt of maidens,
 her mother bears her company as she goes, and with her own hand covers her shoulders and bared arms, herself
 arranges the bow and quiver, and pulls down the girt-up robe, and is proud to trim the disordered tresses. 
 [349] Straightway she accosts the monarch, and there in the presence of the altars: “Here, O king,
 “ she says, “I present to thee the sister of my Achilles – seest thou not how proud her glance
 and like her brother’s? – so high her spirit, she begged for arms and a bow to carry on her
 shoulders, and like an Amazon to spurn the thought of wedlock. But my son is enough care for me; let her carry
 the baskets at the sacrifice, do thou control and tame her wilfulness, and keep her to her sex, till the time
 for marriage come and the end of her maiden modesty; nor suffer her to engage in wanton wrestling-matches, nor
 to frequent the woodland haunts. Bring her up indoors, in seclusion among girls of her own age; above all
 remember to keep her from the harbour and the shore. Lately thou sawest the Phrygian 38 sails: already ships that have crossed the sea have learnt treason to mutual
 loyalties.” 
 [363] The sire accedes to her words, and receives the disguised Achilles by his mother’s ruse – who
 can resist when gods deceive? Nay more, he venerates her with a suppliant’s hand, and gives thanks that he
 was chosen; nor is the band of duteous Scyrian maidens slow to dart keen glances at the face of their new
 comrade, how she o’ertops them by head and neck, how broad her expanse of breast and shoulders; then they
 invite her to join the dance and approach the holy rites, and make room for her in their ranks and rejoice to be
 near her. Just as Idalian birds, 39 cleaving the soft clouds and long since gathered
 in the sky or in their homes, if a strange bird from some distant region has joined them wing to wing, are at
 first all filled with amaze and fear; then nearer and nearer they fly, and while yet in the air have made him
 one of them and hover joyfully around with favouring beat of pinions and lead him to their lofty resting-places.

 [379] Long, ere she departs, lingers the mother at the gate, while she repeats advice and implants whispered
 secrets in his ear and in hushed tones gives her last counsels. Then she plunges into the main, and gazing back
 swims far away, and entreats with flattering prayers the island-shore: “O land that I love, to whom by
 timid cunning I have committed the pledge of my anxious care, a trust that is great indeed, mayst thou prosper
 and be silent, I beg, as Crete was silent for Rhea 40 ; enduring honour and
 everlasting shrines shall gird thee, nor shalt thou be surpassed by unstable 41 
 Delos; sacred alike to wind and wave shalt thou be, and clam abode of Nereïds among the shallows of the
 Cyclades, where the rocks are shattered by Aegean storms, an isle that sailors swear by – only admit no
 Danaan keels, I beg! `Here are only the wands of Bacchus, nought that avails for war;’ that tale bid
 rumour spread, and while the Dorian armaments make ready and Mavors rages from world to world – he may,
 for aught I care – let Achilles be the maiden daughter of good Lycomedes.” 
 [397] Meanwhile avenging Europe, inflamed by war’s sweet frenzy and the monarchs’ complaining
 entreaties, excites her righteous ire; more earnestly pleads that son of Atreus whose spouse abides at home, and
 by his telling makes the Ilian crime more grievous: how without aid of Mars or force of arms the daughter of
 heaven 42 and child of mighty Sparta was taken, and justice, good faith and the gods
 spurned by one deed of rapine. Is this then Phrygian honour? Is this the intercourse of land with land? What
 awaits the common folk, when wrong so deadly attacks the foremost chieftains? All races, all ages flock
 together: nor are they only aroused whom the Isthmian barrier with its rampart fronting on two seas encloses and
 Malea’s wave-resounding promontory, but where afar the strait of Phrixus sunders Europe and Asia; and the
 peoples that fringe Abydos’ shore, bound fast by the waters of the upper sea. 
 [413] The war-fever rises high, thrilling the agitated cities. Temese 43 tames her
 bronze, the Euboean coast shakes with its dockyards, Mycenae echoes with innumerable forges, Pisa makes new
 chariots, Nemea gives the skins of wild beasts, Cirrha vies in packing tight the arrow-bearing quivers, Lerna in
 covering heavey shields with the hides of slaughtered bullocks. Aetolia and fierce Acarnania send infantry to
 war, Argos collects her squadrons, the pasture-lands of rich Arcadia are emptied, Epiros bridles her
 swift-footed nurslings, 44 ye shades of Phocis and Aonia grow scant by reason of the
 javelins, Pylos and Messene strain their fortress-engines. No land but bears its burden; ancestral weapons long
 renounced are torn from lofty portals, gifts to the gods melt in the flame; gold reft from divine keeping Mars
 turns to fiercer use. Nowhere are the shady haunts of old: Othrys is lesser grown, lofty Taygetus sinks low, the
 shorn hills see the light of day. Now the whole forest is afloat: oaks are hewn to make a fleet, the woods are
 diminished for oars. Iron is forced into countless uses, for riveting prows, for armour of defence, for bridling
 chargers, for knitting rough coats of mail by a thousand links, to smoke with blood, to drink deep of wounds, to
 drive death home in conspiracy with poison; they make the dripping whetstones thin with grinding, and add wrath
 to sluggish sword-points. No limit is there to the shaping of bows or heaping up of bullets or the charring of
 stakes or the heightening of helms with crests. Amid such commotion Thessaly alone bewails her indolent repose,
 and brings a twofold complaint against the Fates, that Peleus is too old and Achilles not yet ripe of age. 
 [441] Already the lord of war had drained the land of Pelops and the Grecian world, madly flinging aboard both
 men and horses. All aswarm are the harbours and the bays invisible for shipping, and the moving fleet stirs its
 own storms and billows; the sea itself fails the vessels, and their canvas swallows up every breath of wind. 
 [447] Aulis, sacred to Hecate, first gathers together the Danaan fleet, Aulis, whose exposed cliff and
 long-projecting ridge climb the Euboean sea, coast beloved by the mountain-wandering goddess, and Caphereus,
 that raises his head hard by against the barking waves. He, when he beheld the Pelasgian ships sail by, thrice
 thundered from peak to wave, and gave presage of a night of fury. 45 There assembles
 the armament for Troy’s undoing, there the vast array is sworn, while the sun completes an annual course.
 Then first did Greece behold her own might; then a scattered, dissonant mass took form and feature, and was
 marshalled under one single lord. Even so does the round hunting-net confine the hidden beasts, and gradually
 hem them in as the toils are drawn close. They in panic of the torches and the shouting leave their wide
 pathless haunts, and marvel that their own mountain is shrinking, till from every side they pour into the narrow
 vale; the herds startle each other, and are tamed by mutual fear; bristly boar and bear and wolf are driven
 together, and the hind despises the captured lions. 
 [467] But although the twain Atridae make war in their own cause together, though Sthenelus and Tydeus’
 son surpass in eager valour their fathers’ fame, and Antilochus heeds not his years, and Ajax shakes upon
 his arm the seven leaders of the herd 46 and the circle vast as a city-wall, though
 Ulysses, sleepless in counsel and deeds of arms, joins in the quarrel, yet all the host yearns ardently for the
 absent Achilles, lovingly they dwell upon Achilles’ name, Achilles alone is called for against Hector, him
 and none other do they speak of as the doom of Priam and of Troy. For who else grew up from infancy crawling on
 fresh-dug snow in the Haemonian valleys? Whom else did the Centaur take in hand and shape his rude beginnings
 and tender years? Whose line of ancestry runs nearer heaven? Whom else did a Nereid take by stealth through the
 Stygian waters and make his fair limbs impenetrable to steel? Such talk do the Grecian cohorts repeat and
 interchange. The band of chieftains yields before him and gladly owns defeat. So when the pale denizens of
 heaven flocked into the Phlegraean camp, 47 and already Gradivus was towering to the
 height of his Odrysian 48 spear and Tritonia raised her Libyan snakes and the Delian
 strongly bent his mighty bow, Nature in breathless terror stood looking to the Thunderer alone – when
 would he summon the lightnings and the tempests from the clouds, how many thunderbolts would he ask of
 fiery Aetna? 
 [491] There, while the princes, surrounded by the mingled multitudes of their folk, hold counsel of times for
 sailing and for war, Protesilaus amid great tumult rebukes the prophet Calchas and cries – for to him was
 given the keenest desire to fight, and the glory even then of suffering death the first: “O son of
 Thestor, forgetful of Phoebus and thy own tripods, when wilt thou open thy god-possessed lips more surely, or
 why dost thou hide the secret things of Fate? 49 Seest thou how all are amazed at
 the unknown Aeacides and clamour for him? The Calydonian hero 50 seems nought in the
 people’s eyes, and so too Ajax born of mighty Telamon and lesser Ajax, so do we also: but Mars and the
 capture of Troy will prove the truth. Slighting their leaders – for shame! – they all love him as a
 deity of war. Quickly speak, or why are thy locks enwreathed and held in honour? In what coasts lies he hidden?
 In what land must we seek him? For report has it that he is living neither in Chiron’s cave nor in the
 halls of Peleus his sire. Come, break in upon the gods, harry the fates that lie concealed! Quaff greedily, if
 ever thou dost, thy draughts of laurelled fire! We have relieved thee of dread arms and cruel swords, and never
 shall a helm profane thy unwarlike locks, yet blest shalt thou be and foremost of our chiefs, if of thyself thou
 doest find great Achilles for the Danaans.” 51 
 [514] Long since has the son of Thestor been glancing round about him with excited movements, and by his first
 pallor betrayed the incoming of the god; soon he rolls fiery, bloodshot eyes, seeing neither his comrades nor
 the camp, but blind and absent from the scene he now overhears the mighty councils of gods in the upper air, now
 accosts the prescient birds, now the stern sisters’ threads, now anxiously consults the incense-laden
 altars, and quickly scans the shooting flames and feeds upon the sacred vapours. 52 
 His hair streams out, and the fillet totters on his stiffened locks, his head rolls and he staggers in his gait.
 At last trembling he looses his weary lips from their long bellowings, and his voice has struggled free from the
 resisting frenzy: “Whither bearest thou, O Nereid, by thy woman’s guile great Chiron’s mighty
 pupil? Send him hither: why dost thou carry him away? I will not suffer it: mine is he, mine! Thou art a goddess
 of the deep, but I too am inspired by Phoebus. In what hiding-places triest thou to conceal the destroyer of
 Asia? I see her all bewildered among the Cyclades, in base stealth seeking out the coast. We are ruined! The
 accomplice land of Lycomedes finds favour. Ah! horrid deed! see, flowing garments drape his breast. Rend them,
 boy, rend them, and yield not to thy timid mother. Woe, woe! he is rapt away and is gone! Who is that wicked
 maiden yonder?” 
 [536] Here tottering he ceased, the madness lost its force, and with a shudder he collapsed and fell before the
 altar. Then the Calydonian hero accosts the hesitating Ithacan: “’Tis us 53 that task summons; for I could not refuse to bear thee company, should thy thought
 so lead thee. Though he be sunk in the echoing caves of Tethys far removed and in the bosom of watery Nereus,
 thou wilt find him. Do thou but keep alert the cunning and foresight of thy watchful mind, and arouse thy
 fertile craft: no prophet, methinks, would make bold in perplexity to see the truth before thee.” 
 [545] Ulysses in joy makes answer: “So may almighty God bring it to pass, and the virgin guardian of thy
 sire grant to thee! But fickle hope gives me pause; a great enterprise is it indeed to bring Achilles and his
 arms to our camp, but should the fates say nay, how woeful a disgrace were it to return! Yet will I not leave
 unventured the fulfilment of the Danaans’ desire. Ay, verily, either the Pelean hero shall accompany me
 hither, or the truth lies deep indeed and Calchas hath not spoken by Apollo.” 
 [543] The Danai shout applause, and Agamemnon urges on the willing pair; the gathering breaks up, and the
 dispersing ranks depart with joyful murmurs, even as at nightfall the birds wing their way homeward from the
 pastures, or kindly Hybla sees the swarms returning laden with fresh honey to their cells. Without delay the
 canvas of the Ithacan is already calling for a favouring breeze, and the merry crew are seated at the oars.

ACHILLEID BOOK 1 LINES 560-960, TRANSLATED BY J. H. MOZLEY 
 [560] But far away Deidamia – and she alone – had learnt in stolen secrecy the manhood of Aeacides,
 that lay hid beneath the show of a feigned sex; conscious of guilt concealed there is nought she does not fear,
 and thinks that her sisters know, but hold their peace. For when Achilles, rough as he was, stood amid the
 maiden company, and the departure of his mother rid him of his artless bashfulness, straightway although the
 whole band gathers round him, he chose her as his comrade and assails with new and winning wiles her
 unsuspecting innocence; her he follows, and persistently besets, toward her he ever and again directs his gaze.
 Now too zealously he clings to her side, nor does she avoid him, now he pelts her with light garlands, now with
 baskets that let their burden fall, now with the thyrsus that harms her not, or again he shows her the sweet
 strings of the lyre he knows so well, and the gentle measures and songs of Chiron’s teaching, and guides
 her hand and makes her fingers strike the sounding harp, now as she sings he makes a conquest of her lips, and
 binds her in his embrace, and praises her amid a thousand kisses. With pleasure does she learn of Pelion’s
 summit and of Aeacides, and hearing the name and exploits of the youth is spellbound in constant wonder, and
 sings of Achilles in his very presence. 
 [580] She in her turn teaches him to move his strong limbs with more modest grace and to spin out the unwrought
 wool by rubbing with his thumb, and repairs the distaff and the skeins that his rough hand has damaged; she
 marvels at the deep tones of his voice, how he shuns all her fellows and pierces her with too-attentive gaze and
 at all times hangs breathless on her words; and now he prepares to reveal the fraud, but she like a fickle girl
 avoids him, and will not allow him to confess. Even so beneath his mother Rhea’s rule the young prince of
 Olympus gave treacherous kisses to his sister; he was still her brother and she thought no harm, until the
 reverence for their common blood gave way, and the sister feared a lover’s passion. 54 
 [592] At length the timorous Nereid’s cunning was laid bare. There stood a lofty grove, scene of the
 rites of Agenorean 55 Bacchus, a grove that reached to heaven; within its shade the
 pious matrons were wont to renew the recurrent three-yearly festival, and to bring torn animals of the herd and
 uprooted saplings, and to offer to the god the frenzy wherein he took delight. The law bade males keep far away;
 the reverend monarch repeats the command, and makes proclamation that no man may draw nigh the sacred haunt. Nor
 is that enough; a venerable priestess stands at the appointed limit and scans the approaches, lest any defiler
 come near in the train of women; Achilles laughed silently to himself. His comrades wonder at him as he leads
 the band of virgins and moves his mighty arms with awkward motion – his own sex and his mother’s
 counterfeit alike become him. No more is Deidamia the fairest of her company, and as she surpasses her own
 sisters, so does she herself own defeat compared with proud Aeacides. But when he let the fawn-skin hang from
 his shapely neck, and with ivy gathered up its flowing folds, and bound the purple fillet high upon his flaxen
 temples, and with powerful hand made the enwreathed missile 56 quiver, the crowd
 stood awestruck, and leaving the sacred rites are fain to throng about him, uplifting their bowed heads to gaze.
 Even so Euhius, what time he has relaxed at Thebes his martial spirit and frowning brow, and sated his soul with
 the luxury of his native land, takes chaplet and mitre from his locks, and arms the green thyrsus for the fray,
 and in more martial guise sets out to meet his Indian foes. 57 
 [619] The Moon in her rosy chariot was climging to the height of mid-heaven, when drowsy Sleep glided down with
 full sweep of his pinions to earth and gathered a silent world to his embrace: the choirs reposed, the stricken
 bronze awhile was mute, when Achilles, parted in solitude from the virgin train, thus spoke with himself:
 “How long wilt thou endure the precepts of thy anxious mother, and waste the first flower of thy manhood
 in this soft imprisonment? No weapons of war mayst thou brandish, no beasts mayst thou pursue. Oh! for the
 plains and valleys of Haemonia! Lookest thou in vain, Spercheus, for my swimming, and for my promised tresses?
 Or hast thou no regard for the foster-child that has deserted thee? Am I already spoken of as borne to the
 Stygian shades afar, and does Chiron in solitude bewail my death? Thou, O Patroclus, now does aim my darts, dost
 bend my bow and mount the team that was nourished for me; but I have learnt to fling wide my arms as I grasp the
 vine-wands, and to spin the distaff-thread – ah! shame and vexation to confess it! Nay more, night and day
 thou dost dissemble the love that holds thee, and thy passion for the maid of equal years. How long wilt thou
 conceal the wound that galls thy heart, nor even in love – for shame! – prove thy own
 manhood?” 
 [640] So he speaks; and in the thick darkness of the night, rejoicing that the unstirring silence gives timely
 aid to his secret deeds, he gains by force his desire, and with all his vigour strains her in a real embrace;
 the whole choir of stars beheld from on high, and the horns of the young moon blushed red. She indeed filled the
 grove and mountain with her cries, but the train of Bacchus, dispelling slumber’s cloud, deemed it the
 signal for the dance; on every side the familiar shout arises, and Achilles once more brandishes the thyrsus;
 yet first with friendly speech he solaces the anxious maid: “I am he – why fearest thou? –
 whom my cerulean mother bore wellnigh to Jove, 58 and sent to find my nurture in the
 woods and snows of Thessaly. Nor had I endured this dress and shameful garb, had I not seen thee on the
 seashore; ‘twas for thee I did submit, for thee I carry skeins and bear the womanly timbrel. Why dost thou
 weep who art made daughter-in-law of mighty ocean? Why does thou moan who shalt bear valiant grandsons to
 Olympus? 59 But thy father – Scyros shall be destroyed by fire and sword and
 these walls shall be in ruins and the sport of wanton winds, ere thou pay by cruel death for my embraces: not so
 utterly am I subject to my mother.” 
 [662] Horror-struck was the princess at such dark happenings, albeit long since she had suspected his good
 faith, and shuddered at his presence, and his countenance was changed as he made confession. What is she to do?
 Shall she bear the tale of her misfortune to her father, and ruin both herself and her lover, who perchance
 would suffer untimely death? And still there abode within her breast the love so long deceived. Silent is she in
 her grief, and dissembles the crime that both now share alike; her nurse alone she resolves to make a partner in
 deceit, and she, yielding to the prayers of both, assents. With secret cunning she conceals the rape and the
 swelling womb and the burden of the months of ailing, till Lucina brought round by token the appointed season,
 her course now fully run, and gave deliverance of her child. 
 [675] And now the Laertian 60 bark was threading the winding ways of the Aegean,
 while the breezes changed one for another the countless Cyclades; already Paros and Olearos are hid, now they
 skirt lofty Lemnos and behind them Bacchic Naxos is lost to view, while Samos grows before them; now Delos
 darkens the deep, and there from the tall stern they pour cups of libation, and pray that he oracle be true and
 Calchas undeceived. The Wielder of the Bow 61 heard them, and from the top of
 Cynthus sent a zephyr flying and gave the doubting ones the good omen of a bellying sail. The ship sails
 o’er the sea untroubled; for the Thunderer’s high commands suffered not Thetis to overturn the sure
 decrees of Fate, faint as he was with tears, and foreboding much because she could not excite the main and
 straightway pursue the hated Ulysses with all her winds and waves. 
 [689] Already Phoebus, stooping low upon the verge of Olympus, was sending forth broken rays, and promising to
 his panting steeds the yielding shore of Ocean, when rocky Scyros rose aloft; the Laertian chieftain from the
 stern let out all sail to make it, and bade his crew resume the deep and with their oars supply the failing
 zephyrs. Nearer they draw, and more undoubtedly, more surely was it Scyros, and Tritonia 62 above, the guardian of the tranquil shore. They disembark, and venerate the power of
 the friendly goddess, Aetolian and Ithacan alike. Then the prudent hero, lest they should frighten the
 hospitable walls with sudden throng, bids his crew remain upon the ship; he himself with trusty Diomede ascends
 the heights. But already Abas, keeper of the coastal tower, had gone before them and given tidings to the king,
 that unknown sails, though Greek, were drawing nigh to land. Forward they go, like two wolves leagued together
 on a winter’s night: though their cubs’ hunger and their own assails them, yet do they utterly
 dissemble ravening rage, and go slinking on their way, lest the alertness of dogs announce a foe and warn the
 anxious herdsmen to keep vigil. 
 [[709] So with slow pace the heroes move, and with mutual converse tread the open plain that lies between the
 harbour and the high citadel; first keen Tydides speaks: “By what means now are we preparing to search out
 the truth? For in perplexity of mind have I long been pondering why thou didst buy those unwarlike wands and
 cymbals in the city marts, and didst bring hither Bacchic hides and turbans, and fawn-skins decked with patterns
 of gold. Is it with these thou wilt arm Achilles to be the doom of Priam and the Phrygians?” 
 [718] To him with a smile and somewhat less stern of look the Ithacan replied: “These things, I tell
 thee, if only he be lurking among the maidens in Lycomedes’ palace, shall draw the son of Peleus to the
 fight, ay, self-confessed! Remember thou to bring them all quickly from the ship, when it is time, and to join
 to these gifts a shield that is beautiful with carving and rough with work of gold; this spear will suffice; let
 the good trumpeter Agyrtes be with thee, and let him bring a hidden bugle for a secret purpose.” 
 [726] He spoke and spied the king in the very threshold of the gate, and displaying the olive first announced
 his peaceful purpose: “Loud report, I ween, hath long since reached thy ears, O gentle monarch, of that
 fierce war which now is shaking both Europe and Asia. If perchance the chieftains’ names have been borne
 hither, in whom the avenging son of Atreus trusts, here beholdest thou him whom great-hearted Tydeus begot,
 mightier even than so great a sire, and I am Ulysses the Ithacan chief. The cause of our voyage – for why
 should I fear to confess all to thee, who art a Greek and of all men most renowned by sure report? – is to
 spy out the approaches to Troy and her hated shores, and what their schemes may be.” 
 [737] Ere he had finished the other broke in upon him: “May Fortune assist thee, I pray, and propitious
 gods prosper that enterprise! Now honour my roof and pious home by being my guests.” Therewith he leads
 them within the gate. Straightway numerous attendants prepare the couches and the tables. Meanwhile Ulysses
 scans and searches the palace with his gaze, if anywhere he can find trace of a tall maiden or a face suspect
 for its doubtful features; uncertainly he wanders idly in the galleries and, as though in wonder, roams the
 whole house through; just as yon hunter, having come upon his prey’s undoubted haunts, scours the fields
 with his silent Molossian hound, till he behold his foe stretched out in slumber ‘neath the leaves and his
 jaws resting on the turf. 
 [750] Long since has a rumour been noised throughout the secret chamber where the maidens had their safe abode,
 that Pelasgian chiefs are come, and a Grecian ship and its mariners have been made welcome. With good reason are
 the rest affrighted; but Pelides scarce conceals his sudden joy, and eagerly desires even as he is to see the
 newly-arrived heroes and their arms. Already the noise of princely trains fills the palace, and the guests are
 reclining on gold-embroidered couches, when at their sire’s command his daughters and their chaste
 companions join the banquet; they approach, like unto Amazons on the Maeotid shore, when, having made plunder of
 Scythian homesteads and captured strongholds of the Getae, they lay aside their arms and feast. Then indeed does
 Ulysses with intent gaze ponder carefully both forms and features, but night and the lamps that are brought in
 deceive him, and their stature is hidden as soon as they recline. One nevertheless with head erect and wandering
 gaze, one who preserves no sign of virgin modesty, he marks, and with sidelong glance points out to his
 companion. But if Deidamia, to warn the hasty youth, had not clasped him to her soft bosom, and ever covered
 with her own robe his bare breast and naked arms and shoulders, and many a time forbidden him to start up from
 the couch and ask for wine, and replaced the golden hair-band on his brow, Achilles had even then been revealed
 to the Argive chieftains. 
 [773] When hunger was assuaged and the banquet had twice and three times been renewed, the monarch first
 addresses the Achaeans, and pledges them with the wine-cup: “Ye famous heroes of the Argolic race, I envy,
 I confess, your enterprise; would that I too were of more valiant years, as when I utterly subdued the Dolopes
 who attacked the shores of Scyros, and shattered on the sea those keels that ye beheld on the forefront of my
 lofty walls, tokens of my triumph! At least if I had offspring that I would send to war, - but now ye see for
 yourselves my feeble strength and my dear children: ah, when will these numerous daughters give me
 grandsons?” 
 [784] He spoke, and seizing the moment crafty Ulysses made reply: “Worthy indeed is the object of thy
 desire; for who would not burn to see the countless peoples of the world and various chieftains and princes with
 their trains? All the might and glory of powerful Europe hath sworn together willing allegiance to our righteous
 arms. Cities and fields alike are empty, we have spoiled the lofty mountains, the whole sea lies hidden beneath
 the far-spread shadow of our sails; fathers give weapons, youths snatch them and are gone beyond recall. Never
 was offered to the brave such an opportunity for high renown, never had valour so wide a field of
 exercise.” 
 [794] He sees him all attentive and drinking in his words with vigilant ear, though the rest are alarmed and
 turn aside their downcast eyes, and he repeats: “Whoever hath pride of race and ancestry, whoever hath
 sure javelin and valiant steed, or skill of bow, all honour there awaits him, there is the strife of mighty
 names: scarce do timorous mothers hold back or troops of maids; ah! doomed to barren years and hated of the gods
 is he whom this new chance of glory passes by in idle sloth.” 
 [802] Up from the couches had he sprung, had not Deidamia, watchfully giving the sign to summon all her
 sisters, left the banquet clasping him in her arms; yet still he lingers looking back at the Ithacan, and goes
 out from the company the last of all. Ulysses indeed leaves unsaid somewhat of his purposed speech, yet adds a
 few words: “But do thou abide in deep and tranquil peace, and find husbands for thy beloved daughters,
 whom fortune has given thee, goddess-like in their starry countenances. What awe touched me anon and holds me
 silent? Such charm and beauty joined to manliness of form!” 
 [812] The sire replies: “What if thou couldst see them performing the rites of Bacchus, or about the
 altars of Pallas? Ay, and thou shalt, if perchance the rising south wind prove a laggard.” They eagerly
 accept his promise, and hope inspires their silent prayers. All else in Lycomedes’ palace are at rest in
 peaceful quiet, their troubles laid aside, but to the cunning Ithacan the night is long; he yearns for the day
 and brooks not slumber. 
 [819] Scarce had day dawned, and already the son of Tydeus accompanied by Agyrtes was present bringing the
 appointed gifts. The maids of Scyros too went forth from their chamber and advanced to display their dances and
 promised rites to the honoured strangers. Brilliant before the rest is the princess with Pelides her companion:
 even as beneath the rocks of Aetna in Sicily Diana and bold Pallas and the consort of the Elysian monarch shine
 forth among the nymphs of Enna. Already they begin to move, and the Ismenian 63 pipe
 gives signal to the dancers; four times they beat the cymbals of Rhea, 64 four times
 the maddening drums, four times they trace their manifold windings. Then together they raise and lower their
 wands, and complicate their steps, now in such fashion as the Curetes and devout Samothracians use, 65 now turning to face each other in the Amazonian comb, 66 
 now in the ring wherein the Delian sets the Laconian girls a-dancing, and whirls them shouting her praises into
 her own Amyclae. Then indeed, then above all is Achilles manifest, caring neither to keep his turn nor to join
 arms; then more than ever does he scorn the delicate step, the womanly attire, and breaks the dance and mightily
 disturbs the scene. Even so did Thebes already sorrowing behold Pentheus spurning the wands and the timbrels
 that his mother welcomed. 67 
 [841] The troop disperses amid applause, and they seek again their father’s threshold, where in the
 central chamber of the palace the son of Tydeus hd long since set out gifts that should attract maidens’
 eyes, the mark of kindly welcome and the guerdon of their toil; he bids them choose, nor does the peaceful
 monarch say them nay. Alas! how simple and untaught, who knew not the cunning of the gifts nor Grecian fraud nor
 Ulysses’ many wiles! Thereupon the others, prompted by nature and their ease-loving sex, try the shapely
 wands or the timbrels that answer to the blow, and fasten jewelled band around their temples; the weapons they
 behold, but think them a gift to their mighty sire. But the bold son of Aeacus no sooner saw before him the
 gleaming shield enchased with battle-scenes – by chance too it shone red with the fierce stains of war
 – and leaning against he spear, than he shouted loud and rolled his eyes, and his hair rose up form his
 brow; forgotten were his mother’s words, forgotten his secret love, and Troy fills all his breast. As a
 lion, torn from his mother’s dugs, submits to be tamed and lets his mane be combed, and learns to have awe
 of man and not to fly into a rage save when bidden, yet if but once the steel has glittered in his sight, his
 fealty is forsworn, and his tamer becomes his foe: against him he first ravens, and feels shame to have served a
 timid lord. But when he came nearer, and the emulous brightness gave back his features and he saw himself
 mirrored in the reflecting gold, he thrilled and blushed together. 
 [866] Then quickly went Ulysses to his side and whispered: “Why dost thou hesitate? We know thee, thou
 art the pupil of the half-beast Chiron, thou art the grandson of the sky and sea; thee the Dorian fleet, thee
 thy own Greece awaits with standards uplifted for the march, and the very walls of Pergamum totter and sway for
 thee to overturn. Up! delay no more! Let perfidious Ida grow pale, let they father delight to hear these
 tidings, and guileful Thetis feel shame to have so feared for thee.” 
 [874] Already was he stripping his body of the robes, when Agyrtes, so commanded, blew a great blast upon the
 trumpet: the gifts are scattered, and they flee and fall with prayers before their sire and believe that battle
 is joined. But from his breast the raiment fell without his touching, already the shield and puny spear are lost
 in the grasp of his hand 68 – marvellous to believe! – and he seemed to
 surpass by head and shoulders the Ithacan and the Aetolian chief: with a sheen so awful does the sudden blaze of
 arms and the martial fire dazzle the palace-hall. Mighty of limb, as though forthwith summoning Hector to the
 fray, he stand in the midst of the panic-stricken house: and the daughter of Peleus is sought in vain. 
 [885] But Deidamia in another chamber bewailed the discovery of the fraud, and as soon as he heard her loud
 lament and recognized the voice that he knew so well, he quailed and his spirit was broken by his hidden
 passion. He dropped the shield, and turning to the monarch’s face, while Lycomedes is dazed by the scene
 and distraught by the strange portent, just as he was, in naked panoply of arms, he thus bespeaks him:
 “’Twas I, dear father, I whom bounteous Thetis gave thee – dismiss thy anxious fears! –
 long since did this high renown await thee; ‘tis thou who wilt send Achilles, long sought for, to the
 Greeks, more welcome to me than my might sire – if it is right so to speak – and than beloved
 Chiron. But, if thou wilt, give me thy mind awhile, and of thy favour hear these words: Peleus and Thetis thy
 guest make thee the father-in-law of their son, and recount their kindred deities on either side; they demand
 one of thy train of virgin daughters: doest thou give her? or seem we a mean and coward race? Thou dost not
 refuse. Join then our hands, and make the treaty, and pardon thy own kin. Already hath Deidamia been known to me
 in stolen secrecy; for how could she have resisted these arms of mine, how once in my embrace repel my might?
 Bid me atone that deed: I lay down these weapons and restore them to the Pelasgians, and I remain here. Why
 these angry cries? Why is thy aspect changed? Already art thou my father-in-law” – he placed the
 child before his feet, and added: “and already a grandsire! How often shall the pitiless sword be plied!
 We are a multitude!” 69 
 [910] Then the Greeks too and Ulysses with his persuasive prayer entreat by the holy rites and the sworn word
 of hospitality. He, though moved by the discovery of his dear daughter’s wrong and the command of Thetis,
 though seeming to betray the goddess and so grave a trust, yet fears to oppose so many destinies and delay the
 Argive war – even were he fain, Achilles had spurned even his mother then. Nor is he unwilling to take
 unto himself so great a son-in-law: he is won. Deidamia comes shamefast from her dark privacy, nor in her
 despair believes at first his pardon, and puts forward Achilles to appease her sire. 
 [921] A messenger is sent to Haemonia to give Peleus full tidings of these great events, and to demand ships
 and comrades for the war. Moreover, the Scyrian prince launches two vessels for his son-in-law, and makes excuse
 to the Achaeans for so poor a show of strength. Then the day was brought to its end with feasting, and at last
 the bond was made known to all, and conscious night joined the now fearless lovers. 
 [927] Before her 70 eyes new wars and Xanthus and Ida pass, and the Argolis fleet,
 and she imagines the very waves and fears the coming of the dawn; she flings herself about her new lord’s
 beloved neck, and at last clasping his limbs gives way to tears: “Shall I see thee again, and lay myself
 on this breast of thine, O son of Aeacus? Wilt thou deign once more to look upon thy offspring? Or wilt thou
 proudly bring back spoils of captured Pergamum and Teucrian homes and wish to forget where thou didst hide thee
 as a maid? What should I entreat, or alas! what rather fear? How can I in my anxiety lay a behest on thee, who
 have scarce time to weep? One single night has given and grudged thee to me! Is this the season for our
 espousals? Is this free wedlock? Ah! those stolen sweets! that cunning fraud! Ah! how I fear! Achilles is given
 to me only to be torn away. Go! for I would not dare to stay such mighty preparations; go, and be cautious, and
 remember that the fears of Thetis were not vain; go, and good luck be with thee, and come back mine! 
 [944] “Yes too bold is my request: soon the fair Trojan dames will sigh for thee with tears and beat
 their breasts, and pray that they may offer their necks to thy fetters, and weigh thy couch against their homes,
 or Tyndaris 71 herself will please thee, too much belauded for her incestuous rape.
 But I shall be a story to thy henchmen, the tale of a lad’s first fault, or I shall be disowned and
 forgotten. Nay, come, take me as thy comrade; why should I not carry the standards of Mars with thee? Thou dist
 carry with me the wands and holy things of Bacchus, though ill-fated Troy believe it not. Yet this babe, whom
 thou dost leave as my sad solace – keep him at least within thy heart, and grant this one request, that no
 foreign wife bear thee a child, that no captive woman give unworthy grandsons to Thetis.” 
 [956] As thus she speaks, Achilles, moved to compassion himself, comforts her, and gives her his sworn oath,
 and pledges it with tears, and promises her on his return tall handmaidens and spoils of Ilium and gifts of
 Phrygian treasure. The fickle breezes swept his words unfulfilled away. 

 ACHILLEID BOOK 2 LINES 1-167, TRANSLATED BY J. H. MOZLEY 
 [1] Day arising from Ocean set free the world from dank enfolding shades, and the father of the flashing light
 upraised his torch still dimmed by the neighbouring gloom and moist with sea-water not yet shaken off. And now
 all behold Aeacides, his shoulders stripped of the scarlet robe, and glorious in those very arms he first had
 seized – for the wind is calling and his kindred seas are urging him – and quake before the youthful
 chieftain, not daring to remember aught; so wholly changed to the sight hath he come back, as though he had
 ne’er experiences the shores of Scyros, but were embarking from the Pelian cave. Then duly – for so
 Ulysses counselled – he does sacrifice to the gods and the waters and south winds, and venerates with a
 bull the cerulean king below the waves and Nereus his grandsire: his mother is appeased with garlanded heifer.
 Thereupon casting the swollen entrails on the salt foam he addresses her: “Mother, I have obeyed thee,
 though thy commands were hard to bear; too obedient have I been: now they demand me, and I go to the Trojan war
 and the Argolic fleet.” So speaking he leapt into the bark, and was swept away far from the neighbourhood
 of land by the whistling south wind; already lofty Scyros beings to gather mist about her, and to fade from
 sight over the long expanse of sea. 
 [23] Far away on the summit of a tower with weeping sisters round her his wife leaned forth, holding her
 precious charge, who bore the name of Pyrrhus, and with her eyes fixed on the canvas sailed herself upon the
 sea, and all alone still saw the vessel. He too turned his gaze aside to the walls he held dear, he thinks upon
 the widowed home and the sobs of her he had left: the hidden passion glows again within his heart, and martial
 ire gives place. The Laertian hero perceives him sorrowing, and draws nigh to influence him with gentle words:
 “Was it thou, O destined destroyer of great Troy, whom Danaan fleets and divine oracles are demanding, and
 War aroused is awaiting with unbarred portals – was it thou whom a crafty mother profaned with feminine
 robes, and trusted yonder hiding-place with so great a secret, and hoped the trust was sure? O too anxious, O
 too true a mother! Could such valour lie inert and hidden, that scarce hearing the trumpet-blast fled from
 Thetis and companions and the heart’s unspoken passion? Nor is it due to us that thou comest to the war,
 and compliest with our prayers; thou wouldst have come – ,” 
 [42] He spoke, and thus the Aeacian hero takes up the word: “’Twere long to set forth the causes of
 my tarrying and my mother’s crime; this sword shall make excuse for Scyros and my dishonourable garb, the
 reproach of destiny. Do thou rather, while the sea is peaceful and the sails enjoy the zephyr, tell how the
 Danaans began so great a war: I would fain draw straightway from thy words a righteous anger.” 
 [49] Then the Ithacan, tracing far back the beginning of the tale: “A shepherd, they say – if we
 believe such things – was chosen in Hector’s domain of Ida to end a strife of beauty, and while he
 kept the goddesses anxious doubt looked not with friendly eye upon Minerva’s frowning countenance nor on
 the consort of the heavenly ruler, but gazed overmuch on Dione alone. And verily that quarrel arose in thy own
 glades, at a gathering of the gods, when pleasant Pelion made marriage-feast for Peleus, and thou even then wert
 promised to our armament. Wrath thrills the vanquished ones: the judge demands his fateful reward, and compliant
 Amyclae is shown to the ravisher. He cuts down the Phrygian groves, the secret haunts of the turret-crowned
 mother, and flings down pines that fear to fall to earth, and borne o’er the sea to Achaean lands he
 plunders the marriage-chamber of his host the son of Atreus – ah! shame and pity on proud Europe! –
 and exulting in Helen puts to sea and brings home to Pergamum the spoils of Argos. Then, as the rumours spread
 far and wide through the cities, of our own will, none urging us, we gather, who could endure the unlawful,
 crafty breaking of the marriage-bond, or a consort carried off in unresisted rape, as though a beast of the
 flock or herd, would shake even a valiant heart. Masterful Agenor endured not the treachery of the gods, but
 went in quest of sacred lowings and Europa riding on a mighty god, and scorned the Thunderer as a son-in-law;
 Aeëtes endured not the rape of his daughter 72 from the Scythian shore, but
 with ships and steel pursued the princes and the vessel fated to join the stars: shall we endure a Phrygian
 eunuch hovering about the coasts and harbours of Argos with his incestuous bark? Are our horses and men so
 utterly vanished? Are the seas so impassable to Greeks? What if someone now were to carry of Deidamia from her
 native shores, and tear her from her lonely chamber in dire dismay and crying on the name of great
 Achilles?” 
 [84] His hand flew to the sword-hilt, and a dark flush surged over his face: Ulysses was silent and content.

 [86] Then spoke Oenides: “Nay, O thou worthiest progeny of heaven, tell us, thy admiring friends, of the
 ways in which thy spirit first was trained, and as the vigour of thy youth increased what stirring themes of
 glory Chiron was wont to recount to thee, and how thy valour grew, by what arts he made strong thy limbs or
 fired thy courage; let it be worthy while to have sought Scyros over long leagues of sea, and to have first
 shown weapons to those arms of thine.” 
 [94] Who would find it hard to tell of his own deeds? Yet he begins modestly, somewhat uncertain and more like
 one compelled: “Even in my years of crawling infancy, when the Thessalian sage received me on his stark
 mountain-side, I am said to have devoured no wonted food, nor to have sated my hunger at the nourishing breast,
 but to have gnawed the tough entrails of lions and the bowels of a half-slain she-wolf. That was my first bread,
 that the bounty of joyous Bacchus, in such wise did that father of mine 73 feed me.
 Then he taught me to go with him through pathless deserts, dragging me on with mighty stride, and to laugh at
 sight of the wild beasts, nor tremble at the shattering rocks by rushing torrents or at the silence of the
 lonely forest. Already at that time weapons were in my hand and quivers on my shoulders, the love of steel grew
 apace within me, and my skin was hardened by much sun and frost; nor were my limbs weakened by soft couches, but
 I shared the hard rock with my master’s mighty frame. 
 [110]”Scarce had my raw youth turned the wheel of twice six years, when already he made me outpace swift
 hinds and Lapith steeds and running overtake the flung dart; often Chiron himself, while yet he was swift of
 foot, chased me at full gallop 74 with headlong speed o’er all the plains, and
 when I was exhausted by roaming over the meads he praised my joyously and hoisted me upon his back. Often too in
 the first freezing of the streams he would bid me go upon them with light step nor break the ice. These were my
 boyhood glories. Why now should I tell thee of the woodland battles and of the glades that know my fierce shout
 no more? Never would he suffer me to follow unwarlike does through the pathless glens of Ossa, or lay low timid
 lynxes with my spear, but only to drive angry bears from their resting-places, and boars with lightning thrust;
 or if anywhere a mighty tiger lurked or a lioness with her cubs in some secret lair upon the mountain-side, he
 himself, seated in his vast cave, awaited my exploits, if perchance I should return bespattered with dark blood;
 nor did he admit me to his embrace before he had scanned my weapons. 
 [129] “And already I was being prepared for the armed tumults of the neighbouring folk, and no fashion of
 savage warfare passed me by. I learnt how the Paeonians whirl and fling their darts and the Macetae their
 javelins, with how fierce a rush the Sarmatian plies his pike and the Getan his falchion, how the Gelonian draws
 his bow, and how the Balearic wielder of the pliant thong keeps the missile swinging round with balanced motion,
 and as he swings it marks out a circle in the air. 75 Scarce could I recount all my
 doings, successful though they were; now he instructs me to span huge dykes by leaping, now to climb and grasp
 the airy mountain-peak, with what stride to run upon the level, how to catch flung stones in mimic battle on my
 shielded arm, to pass through burning houses, and to check flying four-horse teams on foot. 
 [145] “Spercheus, I remember was flowing with rapid current, fed full with constant rains and melted
 snows and carrying on its flood boulders and living trees, when he sent me in, there were the waves rolled
 fiercest, and bade me stand against them and hurl back the swelling billows that he himself could scarce have
 borne, though he stood to face them with so many a limb. 76 I strove to stand, but
 the violence of the stream and the dizzy panic of the broad spate forced me to give ground; he loomed o’er
 me from above and fiercely threatened, and flung taunts to shame me. Nor did I depart till he gave me word, so
 far did the lofty love of fame constrain me, and my toils were not too hard with such a witness. For to fling
 the Oebalian 77 quoit far out of sight into the clouds, or to practise the holds of
 the sleek wrestling-bout, and to scatter blows with the boxing-gloves were sport and rest to me: nor laboured I
 more therein that when I struck with my quill the sounding strings, or told the wondrous fame of heroes of old.

 [159] “Also did he teach me of juices and the grasses that succour disease, what remedy will staunch too
 fast a flow of blood, what will lull to sleep, what will close gaping wounds; what plague should be checked by
 the knife, what will yield to herbs; and he implanted deep within my heart the precepts of divine justice,
 whereby he was wont to give revered laws to the tribes that dwelt on Pelion, and tame his own twy-formed folk.
 So much do I remember, friends, of the training of my earliest years, and sweet is their remembrance; the rest
 my mother knows.” 
 THE END 

 54. The courting of Juno by the youthful Jupiter is also mentioned
 Theb. x. 61 sq. 
 55. From Agenor, king of Tyre, from whom Semele, his mother, was descended. 
 56. i.e. , the thyrsus. 
 57. There is a sort of inverted comparison here: the warlike Achilles putting on Bacchic garb
 is compared to effeminate Bacchus making ready for war. 
 58. Thetis nearly became the wife of Jove, so that Achilles was “nearly” his son.
 An oracle warned Jove that the son thus born would destroy him. Wilamowitz’s conjecture
 “Paeoniis” is attractive. 
 59. Peleus was descended from Zeus; cf. 869, 899. 
 60. Because Ulysses was son of Laertes.

 61. Apollo. 
 62. Cf. l. 285. 
 63. i.e. Theban (from the river Ismenos), i.e. Bacchic. 
 64. Here = Cybele, worshipped by the Corybantes with very noisy rites. 
 65. The Curetes were priests of Jupiter (Zeus) in Crete; the Samothracians celebrated mysteries
 in honour of the Cabiri. 
 66. “pectin” was the name of a dance in which, one may gather, two opposing lines
 met and passed through each other. 
 67. Pentheus, king of Thebes, tried to put down the Bacchus-worship of which his mother Agave
 was a votary. “tristes,” as though with apprehension of his fate (he was torn in pieces by his own
 mother in her frenzy). 
 68. “consumitur,” a vivid use of the word; “is consumed, or used up by
 “his hand, which is too mighty for it. 
 69. i.e. , there was not only Achilles for Lycomedes to slay, but his daughter and his
 grandson also. 
 70. i.e. , Deidamia’s.

 71. Helen, daughter of Tyndareus. 
 72. Medea. The Argo was set in heaven as a constellation by Pallas. 
 73. i.e. , Chiron. 
 74. “admissus,” cf. The common phrase "admisso equo." 
 75. cf. Theb. iv. 67. 
 76. i.e. , he had four legs to withstand the torrent. 
 77. See note on Silv. v. 3. 53; but it may simply mean Spartan, as being a sport much
 practised in Sparta.
