## Overview

**Idmon** was an Argonaut and seer from Argos who was in truth a son of [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) — though nominally counted among the Aeolids as son of Abas — and had been taught his art directly by the god. He is notable above all for having foreseen by augury that the voyage would cost him his life, yet joining the expedition anyway, so that he would not be denied his share of glory. He died on the outward voyage, killed by a boar in the marshes of Mariandynia. His death is treated as a significant loss; the crew mourned him for three days and buried him with full honours.

## Powers

Idmon's art of prophecy was taught to him directly by his true father, [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md): "[Apollo] himself taught him the art of prophecy—to pay heed to birds and to observe the signs of the burning sacrifice."[^arg1-art] He was thus an augur, reading omens from the behavior of birds and from the signs of fire at sacrifice.

## In the Argonautica

### Joining the Expedition (Book I)

Apollonius introduces Idmon at the end of the catalogue of Argonauts assembled at Argos. He came last, and his decision to join despite knowing his fate is presented as an act of deliberate courage:

> "Idmon came last of all them that dwelt at Argos, for though he had learnt his own fate by augury, he came, that the people might not grudge him fair renown. He was not in truth the son of Abas, but Leto's son himself begat him to be numbered among the illustrious Aeolids; and himself taught him the art of prophecy—to pay heed to birds and to observe the signs of the burning sacrifice."[^arg1-catalogue]

### The Sacrifice at Departure (Book I)

Before sailing from Pagasae, the crew raised an altar to [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) and sacrificed two steers. [Jason](../heroes/jason.md) prayed to Apollo for a safe voyage. Idmon observed the flames:

> "Aeson's son poured out pure libations, and Idmon rejoiced beholding the flame as it gleamed on every side from the sacrifice, and the smoke of it mounting up with good omen in dark spiral columns; and quickly he spake outright the will of Leto's son."[^arg1-sacrifice]

He then delivered a prophecy to the assembled crew:

> "For you it is the will of heaven and destiny that ye shall return here with the fleece; but meanwhile both going and returning, countless trials await you. But it is my lot, by the hateful decree of a god, to die somewhere afar off on the mainland of Asia. Thus, though I learnt my fate from evil omens even before now, I have left my fatherland to embark on the ship, that so after my embarking fair fame may be left me in my house."[^arg1-prophecy]

The crew rejoiced at the promise of return but grieved for Idmon.[^arg1-reaction]

### Death in Mariandynia (Book II)

Idmon's foreseen end came during a stay at the Acherusian headland in the land of the Mariandyni. After a day of feasting with King Lycus, the crew had descended to the ship at dawn when a boar attacked from the reeds:

> "And here his destined fate smote Idmon, son of Abas, skilled in soothsaying; but not at all did his soothsaying save him, for necessity drew him on to death. For in the mead of the reedy river there lay, cooling his flanks and huge belly in the mud, a white-tusked boar, a deadly monster, whom even the nymphs of the marsh dreaded, and no man knew it; but all alone he was feeding in the wide fell."[^arg2-fate]

> "the boar from some unseen lair leapt out of the reed-bed, and charging gashed his thigh and severed in twain the sinews and the bone. And with a sharp cry the hero fell to the ground."[^arg2-wound]

[Peleus](../heroes/peleus.md) hurled a hunting spear at the fleeing boar; it turned and charged again, but Idas wounded it and it fell impaled. "The boar they left on the ground just as he had fallen there; but Idmon, now at the last gasp, his comrades bore to the ship in sorrow of heart, and he died in his comrades' arms."[^arg2-death]

### Burial and Honour (Book II)

The crew remained at the headland for three full days of mourning before burying Idmon with full honours. King Lycus himself took part: "the people and King Lycus himself took part in the funeral rites; and, as is the due of the departed, they slaughtered countless sheep at his tomb."[^arg2-burial]

Apollonius describes the lasting memorial: "a barrow to this hero was raised in that land, and there stands a token for men of later days to see, the trunk of a wild olive tree, such as ships are built of; and it flourishes with its green leaves a little below the Acherusian headland."[^arg2-barrow]

The narrator adds that [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) himself commanded the Boeotians and Nisaeans to worship Idmon as guardian of their city and to build their city around the trunk of the ancient wild olive.[^arg2-phoebus]
