## Overview

**Phaethon** was the mortal son of [Helius](../deities/helius.md) who, seeking proof of his divine parentage, demanded to drive his father's sun chariot for a day. Unable to control the immortal horses, he set the earth ablaze and was struck down by [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md)'s thunderbolt.

### The Eridanus

The Argonauts sailed past the river Eridanus, where Phaethon son of [Helius](../deities/helius.md) had fallen when struck by [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md)'s thunderbolt. The place still "belcheth up heavy steam clouds from the smouldering wound." The daughters of Helius (the Heliades), "enclosed in tall poplars, wretchedly wail a piteous plaint; and from their eyes they shed on the ground bright drops of amber."[^arg-phaethon-river] The heroes had to row through the grievous smell of smouldering.[^arg-phaethon-stench]

### Apsyrtus Called Phaethon

The Argonautica also records that Apsyrtus, prince of Colchis and [Medea](../heroes/medea.md)'s brother, was called "Phaethon" by the Colchians "because he outshone all the youths."[^arg-phaethon-apsyrtus] This is a honorific use of the name, unrelated to the myth of the sun chariot.

[^arg-phaethon-river]: "it belcheth up heavy steam clouds from the smouldering wound... the maidens, the daughters of Helios, enclosed in tall poplars, wretchedly wail a piteous plaint; and from their eyes they shed on the ground bright drops of amber" (Argonautica 4.596-605, trans. R.C. Seaton)
[^arg-phaethon-stench]: The Argonauts rowed past the Eridanus through a grievous smell of burning from the wound Phaethon left in the earth (Argonautica 4.617-618, trans. R.C. Seaton)
[^arg-phaethon-apsyrtus]: Apsyrtus was called Phaethon by the Colchians "because he outshone all the youths" (Argonautica 3.245-247, trans. R.C. Seaton)

### The Challenge to His Birth

Phaethon's disaster began with a taunt. Epaphus, son of [Io](io.md), mocked him: "Poor, demented fellow, what will you not credit if your mother speaks, you are so puffed up with the fond conceit of your imagined sire, the Lord of Day."[^met-phaethon-1] Stung by shame, Phaethon demanded proof from his mother Clymene, who swore by the sun itself: "I swear to you by yonder orb, so radiant and bright, which both beholds and hears us while we speak, that you are his begotten son."[^met-phaethon-2]

### The Palace of the Sun

Phaethon journeyed to [Helius](../deities/helius.md)'s palace, a structure "glowing with gold, flaming with carbuncles on stately columns raised," where [Hephaestus](../deities/hephaestus.md) (Mulciber) had engraved the seas and earth and heavens.[^met-phaethon-3] Helius acknowledged his son and rashly swore by the Styx to grant any wish. Phaethon demanded the chariot.

### The Father's Warning

Helius pleaded with his son to choose anything else, describing the terrors of the sky-road: "The opening path is steep and difficult... extreme of midmost Heaven, and sea and earth are viewed below, my trembling breast is filled with fearful apprehensions."[^met-phaethon-4] He offered proof of paternity through his very fear: "My fears for thee are certain signs that thou art of my race—by my paternal fears 'tis manifest I am thy father."[^met-phaethon-5] But Phaethon "resisted his advice, and urged again his claim."

### The Chariot Ride

The horses — Eous, Aethon, Pyrois, and Phlegon — sensed the lightness of their new driver. The chariot "leaped lightly in the air, and in the heights was tossed unsteady as an empty shell."[^met-phaethon-6] Phaethon lost control utterly: he "knew not to guide with trusted reins, nor where the way might be—nor, if he knew, could he control their flight." When the constellation Scorpion loomed before him, "he was lost; and, fixed in chills of horror, dropped the reins."

### The Burning of the Earth

The unchecked chariot scorched the world. Great cities and mountains burned: "Cilician Taurus, Athos and Tmolus, and Oeta are burning; and the far-famed Ida and all her cooling rills are dry and burning." Rivers boiled — the Nile itself "affrighted fled to parts remote, and hid his head forever from the world."[^met-phaethon-7] Even the Earth herself cried out to [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md): "If this is thy decree, O, Highest of the Gods—if I have sinned why do thy lightnings linger?"[^met-phaethon-8]

### The Thunderbolt and Fall

Zeus struck Phaethon from the chariot with a thunderbolt, quenching the fires that consumed the earth. "Far fell Phaethon with flaming hair; as haply from the summer sky appears a falling star." The river Eridanus received his body, and Hesperian Naiads entombed him with this epitaph: "Here Phaethon's remains lie buried. He who drove his father's car and fell, although he made a great attempt."[^met-phaethon-9]

### The Mourning

Helius "destitute of all his rays... abhors himself and hates the light" and threatened to abandon the sky.[^met-phaethon-10] Phaethon's sisters, the Heliades, wept at his tomb for four months until they were transformed into poplar trees, their tears hardening into amber. Their cousin Cycnus, grief-stricken, was transformed into a swan.

[^met-phaethon-8]: "If this is thy decree, O, Highest of the Gods—if I have sinned why do thy lightnings linger? For if doomed by fires consuming I to perish must, let me now die in thy celestial flames" (Metamorphoses 2.281-285, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-phaethon-9]: "Here Phaethon's remains lie buried. He who drove his father's car and fell, although he made a great attempt" (Metamorphoses 2.327-328, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-phaethon-10]: "destitute of all his rays, the sire of Phaethon, as dark as when eclipse bedims his Wheel, abhors himself and hates the light" (Metamorphoses 2.381-384, trans. Brookes More)
