## Overview

**Rhesus** was the king of Thrace, son of the river-god Strymon and one of the [Muses](../deities/groups/muses.md). He came as a late ally of [Troy](../places/troy.md) during the [Trojan War](../events/trojan-war.md), arriving with a vast army, magnificent white horses, and golden armour. He was killed on his first night in the camp by [Diomedes](diomedes.md), who stole his horses with [Odysseus](odysseus.md)'s help, guided by [Athena](../deities/athena.md).

## In the Iliad

### The Night Raid (Book X)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book X, [Dolon](dolon.md) reveals to [Odysseus](odysseus.md) and [Diomedes](diomedes.md) the location of Rhesus's camp. Rhesus had just arrived with the Thracians and was sleeping on the outermost edge, apart from the other Trojan allies. Diomedes slew Rhesus and twelve of his companions while Odysseus led away the horses.[^il10-rhesus]

[^il10-rhesus]: Iliad 10.434-497, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers

## In the Bibliotheca

[Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) records that among the Trojans' allies were "Rhesus, son of the river Strymon and Calliope, one of the Muses."[^apd-rhesus] He notes that "some say that he was slain by Diomedes."[^apd-death]

[^apd-rhesus]: "Rhesus, son of the river Strymon and Calliope, one of the Muses" (Bibliotheca E.4.4, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-death]: "some say that he [Rhesus] was slain by Diomedes" (Bibliotheca E.4.4, trans. J.G. Frazer)

## In Euripides' [Rhesus](../sources/euripides-rhesus.md)

### Arrival at Troy

Rhesus arrives at the Trojan camp by night with a vast Thracian army. A Shepherd describes his appearance: "majestic Rhesus, like a god, high in his chariot, drawn by Thracian steeds whiter than snow, a golden beam confined their necks, and o'er his shoulders hung a shield adorned with sculptures wrought in massive gold."[^eur-rh-arrival] His horses wear a brazen Gorgon on their bridles that tinkled "with alarming sound." The Chorus hails him as a god of war: "A god, O Troy, e'en Mars himself, from Strymon's current sprung, and from the Muse."[^eur-rh-mars]

### Confrontation with Hector

[Hector](hector.md) rebukes Rhesus harshly for his lateness — nine years of war, and only now does he come. Rhesus defends himself: he was fighting a Scythian invasion, took hostages, and marched overland in bitter conditions. He boasts that a single day will suffice for him to destroy the entire Greek army: "it for me will be sufficient that the sun once mount the heavens, while I their bulwarks storm, invade their fleet, and slay the Greeks."[^eur-rh-boast]

### Death

[Athena](../deities/athena.md) warns [Odysseus](odysseus.md) and [Diomedes](diomedes.md) that if Rhesus survives the night, "nor Ajax, nor can Achilles hinder him from wasting the camp of Greece."[^eur-rh-athena] She directs them to where Rhesus sleeps, apart from the other Trojans. Diomedes kills him and his guards while Odysseus steals the horses.

Rhesus's wounded Charioteer recounts a prophetic dream he had before the attack: two wolves mounted the horses and lashed them forward. He accuses [Hector](hector.md) of murdering Rhesus for his horses, though Hector blames Odysseus.[^eur-rh-dream]

### Apotheosis

Rhesus's mother, a Muse, descends bearing his body. She reveals that Rhesus was conceived at the river Strymon after the Muses' contest with Thamyris. She sent the infant to Strymon, who gave him to river-nymphs to raise. She prophesies that Rhesus will not remain among the dead but will become a demigod: "from a man exalted to a god, restored to life, the priest of Bacchus, and of him who dwells beneath Pangeum's rock, a god adored by those who haunt his orgies."[^eur-rh-apotheosis]
