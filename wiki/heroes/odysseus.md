## Overview

**Odysseus** is the king of Ithaca and protagonist of the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md). He is the foremost Greek hero of cunning and resourcefulness, favoured above all mortals by [Athena](../deities/athena.md) and opposed by [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md). [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) himself praises him: "how should I forget divine Odysseus, who in understanding is beyond mortals and beyond all men hath done sacrifice to the deathless gods?"[^od1-zeus-praise] Through [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md), his maternal grandfather Autolycus received the gifts of thievery and cunning from the god himself, and this divine favour passes into Odysseus's bloodline.[^od19-autolycus]

[^od1-zeus-praise]: "how should I forget divine Odysseus, who in understanding is beyond mortals and beyond all men hath done sacrifice to the deathless gods, who keep the wide heaven?" (Odyssey I.789-792, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od19-autolycus]: "Autolycus, his mother's noble father, who outdid all men in thievery and skill in swearing. This skill was the gift of the god himself, even Hermes, for that he burned to him the well-pleasing sacrifice of the thighs of lambs and kids; wherefore Hermes abetted him gladly." (Odyssey XIX.10544-10548, trans. Butcher and Lang)

## Appearance

The sources give an unusually full picture of Odysseus's physical form. On the walls of Troy, Priam observes him in the Greek ranks: "shorter by a head than Agamemnon son of Atreus, but broader of shoulder and of chest to behold," and likens him to "a thick-fleeced ram ordering a great flock of ewes."[^app-priam] Antenor, who had hosted both Odysseus and Menelaos as envoys, recalls that when standing, "Menelaos overpassed them all by the measure of his broad shoulders; but when both sat down, Odysseus was the more stately." Antenor then describes his manner of speaking: "whenever Odysseus full of wiles rose up, he stood and looked down, with eyes fixed upon the ground, and waved not his staff whether backwards or forwards, but held it stiff, like to a man of no understanding; one would deem him to be churlish, and naught but a fool. But when he uttered his great voice from his chest, and words like unto the snowflakes of winter, then could no mortal man contend with Odysseus."[^app-antenor]

For the night raid in [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) X, Odysseus wears a distinctive helmet with a storied provenance: "a helm made of leather, and with many a thong was it stiffly wrought within, while without the white teeth of a boar of flashing tusks were arrayed thick set on either side, well and cunningly, and in the midst was fixed a cap of felt." The helmet was originally stolen by his grandfather Autolykos and passed through several owners before reaching him.[^app-helmet]

[Athena](../deities/athena.md) repeatedly transforms his appearance throughout the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md). After he washes ashore on the Phaeacian coast, she "made him greater and more mighty to behold, and from his head caused deep curling locks to flow, like the hyacinth flower. And as when some skilful man overlays gold upon silver -- one that Hephaestus and Pallas Athene have taught all manner of craft, and full of grace is his handiwork -- even so did Athene shed grace about his head and shoulders."[^app-vi-beautify] She enhances him again before the Phaeacian games, making him "greater and more mighty to behold, that he might win love and worship and honour among all the Phaeacians."[^app-viii-beautify]

On Ithaca, Athena transforms him into a beggar: "His fair flesh she withered on his supple limbs, and made waste his yellow hair from off his head, and over all his limbs she cast the skin of an old man, and dimmed his two eyes, erewhile so fair. And she changed his raiment to a vile wrap and a doublet, torn garments and filthy, stained with foul smoke."[^app-beggar]

After the slaying of the wooers and his reunion with Penelope, Athena restores him with the same imagery used at Phaeacia: "Athene shed great beauty from his head downwards, and made him greater and more mighty to behold, and from his head caused deep curling locks to flow, like the hyacinth flower. And as when some skilful man overlays gold upon silver... even so did Athene shed grace about his head and shoulders, and forth from the bath he came, in form like to the immortals."[^app-xxiii-beautify]

[^app-priam]: "Come now, tell me of this man too, dear child, who is he, shorter by a head than Agamemnon son of Atreus, but broader of shoulder and of chest to behold? His armour lieth upon the bounteous earth, and himself like a bell-wether rangeth the ranks of warriors. Yea, I liken him to a thick-fleeced ram ordering a great flock of ewes." (Iliad III.1810-1815, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^app-antenor]: "when they mingled with the Trojans in the assembly, while all stood up Menelaos overpassed them all by the measure of his broad shoulders; but when both sat down, Odysseus was the more stately... whenever Odysseus full of wiles rose up, he stood and looked down, with eyes fixed upon the ground, and waved not his staff whether backwards or forwards, but held it stiff, like to a man of no understanding; one would deem him to be churlish, and naught but a fool. But when he uttered his great voice from his chest, and words like unto the snowflakes of winter, then could no mortal man contend with Odysseus; then marvelled we not thus to behold Odysseus' aspect." (Iliad III.1825-1838, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^app-helmet]: "on his head set a helm made of leather, and with many a thong was it stiffly wrought within, while without the white teeth of a boar of flashing tusks were arrayed thick set on either side, well and cunningly, and in the midst was fixed a cap of felt. This casque Autolykos once stole from Amyntor son of Ormenos, out of Eleon" (Iliad X.5835-5840, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^app-vi-beautify]: "Athene, the daughter of Zeus, made him greater and more mighty to behold, and from his head caused deep curling locks to flow, like the hyacinth flower. And as when some skilful man overlays gold upon silver—one that Hephaestus and Pallas Athene have taught all manner of craft, and full of grace is his handiwork—even so did Athene shed grace about his head and shoulders." (Odyssey VI.3699-3704, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^app-viii-beautify]: "she made him greater and more mighty to behold, that he might win love and worship and honour among all the Phaeacians" (Odyssey VIII.4168-4169, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^app-beggar]: "Athene touched him with her wand. His fair flesh she withered on his supple limbs, and made waste his yellow hair from off his head, and over all his limbs she cast the skin of an old man, and dimmed his two eyes, erewhile so fair. And she changed his raiment to a vile wrap and a doublet, torn garments and filthy, stained with foul smoke." (Odyssey XIII.7415-7419, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^app-xxiii-beautify]: "Athene shed great beauty from his head downwards, and made him greater and more mighty to behold, and from his head caused deep curling locks to flow, like the hyacinth flower. And as when some skilful man overlays gold upon silver, one that Hephaestus and Pallas Athene have taught all manner of craft, and full of grace is his handiwork, even so did Athene shed grace about his head and shoulders, and forth from the bath he came, in form like to the immortals." (Odyssey XXIII.12339-12346, trans. Butcher and Lang)

## In the Iliad

### The Rallying of the Army (Book II)

When the Greeks rush to flee after Agamemnon's test, [Athena](../deities/athena.md) goes directly to Odysseus to rally the army. She addresses him as "Heaven-sprung son of Laertes, Odysseus of many devices, will ye indeed fling yourselves upon your benched ships to flee homeward to your dear native land?" He "knew the voice of the goddess" and through him [Athena](../deities/athena.md) restores order to the Greek host.[^il2-rally]

[^il2-rally]: "bright-eyed Athene stood by him and said: 'Heaven-sprung son of Laertes, Odysseus of many devices, will ye indeed fling yourselves upon your benched ships to flee homeward to your dear native land?'" (Iliad II.946-948, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

### The Embassy to Achilles (Book IX)

Odysseus leads the embassy to Achilles in Book IX, delivering the formal offer of gifts and reconciliation from Agamemnon. Achilles addresses him directly: "son of Laertes, Odysseus of many wiles, in openness must I now declare my saying" — before refusing the embassy and revealing his two fates.[^il9-embassy]

[^il9-embassy]: "son of Laertes, Odysseus of many wiles, in openness must I now declare my saying" (Iliad IX.5219, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

### The Night Raid with Diomedes (Book X)

In Book X, Odysseus and Diomedes undertake the night raid (Doloneia). [Athena](../deities/athena.md) guides them throughout — sending a heron omen, breathing might into Diomedes, standing as an evil dream over Rhesos, and warning them to retreat. Athena is called "the Giver of Spoil," and it is noted that "Pallas Athene loveth him" — referring to Odysseus.[^il10-raid]

[^il10-raid]: "Pallas Athene loveth him" (Iliad X, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

### Wounded and Protected (Book XI)

In Book XI, Odysseus is wounded by Sokos but [Athena](../deities/athena.md) protects him from a mortal blow, deflecting the spear so that it "did not suffer it to mingle with the bowels."[^il11-wound] [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) had sent the personified Discord to stand on Odysseus's ship in the centre of the Greek line, marking his position as the army's midpoint.[^il11-discord]

[^il11-wound]: "did not suffer it to mingle with the bowels" (Iliad XI, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il11-discord]: "she stood upon the huge black ship of Odysseus, that was in the midst, to make her voice heard on either side" (Iliad XI.6162-6164, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

### The Funeral Games (Book XXIII)

In the funeral games for Patroklos, [Athena](../deities/athena.md) aids Odysseus in the foot-race, making his limbs light and tripping Aias in ox-filth. Aias himself acknowledges the divine patronage: "the goddess who from of old like a mother standeth by Odysseus' side and helpeth him."[^il23-games]

[^il23-games]: "the goddess who from of old like a mother standeth by Odysseus' side and helpeth him" (Iliad XXIII.13463-13464, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

## In the Odyssey

### Athena's Patronage

The relationship between Odysseus and [Athena](../deities/athena.md) is the theological heart of the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md). She advocates for him before [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) at the poem's opening: "my heart is rent for wise Odysseus, that hapless one, who far from his friends this long while suffereth affliction in a seagirt isle."[^od1-advocate] She proposes the plan to free him from Calypso and goes herself to rouse his son Telemachus.

When they are reunited on Ithaca in Book XIII, [Athena](../deities/athena.md) delivers one of the poem's most remarkable speeches, binding patron and hero by kinship of mind: "both of us practised in deceits, for that thou art of all men far the first in counsel and in discourse, and I in the company of all the gods win renown for my wit and wile."[^od13-craft]

She explains her long absence: though she was "always by thee and guard thee in all adventures," she had "no mind to be at strife with [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md), my own father's brother."[^od13-poseidon]

Throughout the poem, [Athena](../deities/athena.md) transforms Odysseus at will with her wand — withering his skin and dimming his eyes to disguise him as a beggar, then restoring him with hyacinth curls and a form "greater and more mighty to behold."[^od6-beautify] She beautifies him for Nausicaa, for Penelope, and holds back Dawn itself so that husband and wife may have their night together.[^od23-dawn]

In the final battle, she appears as Mentor, chides Odysseus for feeble courage, then holds up her destroying [aegis](../objects/aegis.md) from the roof to rout the wooers.[^od22-aegis] The poem ends with [Athena](../deities/athena.md) setting the final covenant of peace "in the likeness of Mentor, both in fashion and in voice."[^od24-covenant]

[^od1-advocate]: "my heart is rent for wise Odysseus, that hapless one, who far from his friends this long while suffereth affliction in a seagirt isle" (Odyssey I.774-776, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od13-craft]: "both of us practised in deceits, for that thou art of all men far the first in counsel and in discourse, and I in the company of all the gods win renown for my wit and wile" (Odyssey XIII.7280-7282, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od13-poseidon]: "I had no mind to be at strife with Poseidon, my own father's brother" (Odyssey XIII.7320-7322, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od6-beautify]: "Athene, the daughter of Zeus, made him greater and more mighty to behold, and from his head caused deep curling locks to flow, like the hyacinth flower" (Odyssey VI.3700-3702, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od23-dawn]: "the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, had other thoughts. The night she held long in the utmost West, and on the other side she stayed the golden-throned Dawn by the stream Oceanus, and suffered her not to harness the swift-footed steeds that bear light to men" (Odyssey XXIII.12421-12426, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od22-aegis]: "Athene held up her destroying aegis on high from the roof, and their minds were scared, and they fled through the hall, like a drove of kine that the flitting gadfly falls upon and scatters hither and thither in spring time" (Odyssey XXII.11964-11967, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od24-covenant]: "Pallas Athene set a covenant between them with sacrifice, she, the daughter of Zeus lord of the aegis, in the likeness of Mentor, both in fashion and in voice" (Odyssey XXIV.13114-13116, trans. Butcher and Lang)

### Poseidon's Wrath

[Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) is Odysseus's primary divine antagonist. "All the gods had pity on him save Poseidon, who raged continually against godlike Odysseus, till he came to his own country."[^od1-rage] His anger stems from Odysseus blinding his son [Polyphemus](../creatures/cyclopes.md), who prayed: "Hear me, Poseidon, girdler of the earth, god of the dark hair, if indeed I be thine, and thou avowest thee my sire, -- grant that he may never come to his home, even Odysseus, waster of cities, the son of Laertes... late may he come in evil case, with the loss of all his company, in the ship of strangers, and find sorrows in his house." And "the god of the dark locks heard him."[^od9-prayer] This prayer exactly describes the course of Odysseus's return.

When [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) spots Odysseus near Phaeacia, he unleashes a full storm: "he gathered the clouds and troubled the waters of the deep, grasping his trident in his hands; and he roused all storms of all manner of winds." He smashes the raft with a great wave and departs with a final warning: "Even so, after all thy sufferings, go wandering over the deep."[^od5-storm]

[^od1-rage]: "all the gods had pity on him save Poseidon, who raged continually against godlike Odysseus, till he came to his own country" (Odyssey I.746-748, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od9-prayer]: "Hear me, Poseidon, girdler of the earth, god of the dark hair, if indeed I be thine, and thou avowest thee my sire,—grant that he may never come to his home, even Odysseus, waster of cities, the son of Laertes, whose dwelling is in Ithaca; yet if he is ordained to see his friends and come unto his well-builded house, and his own country, late may he come in evil case, with the loss of all his company, in the ship of strangers, and find sorrows in his house... So he spake in prayer, and the god of the dark locks heard him" (Odyssey IX.5263-5272, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od5-storm]: "he gathered the clouds and troubled the waters of the deep, grasping his trident in his hands; and he roused all storms of all manner of winds, and shrouded in clouds the land and sea: and down sped night from heaven" (Odyssey V.3265-3268, trans. Butcher and Lang)

### Calypso's Island

Odysseus is held for years on the island of Ogygia by the nymph Calypso, "the daughter of the wizard [Atlas](../deities/atlas.md), who knows the depths of every sea, and himself upholds the tall pillars which keep earth and sky asunder."[^od1-calypso] When [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) commands his release, [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md) is sent to Calypso with the message. Hermes binds on his golden sandals, takes his wand, and flies "like the cormorant" over the waves to deliver [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md)'s command: "surely it is in no wise possible for another god to go beyond or to make void the purpose of Zeus, lord of the aegis."[^od5-hermes]

[^od1-calypso]: "the daughter of the wizard Atlas, who knows the depths of every sea, and himself upholds the tall pillars which keep earth and sky asunder" (Odyssey I.780-782, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od5-hermes]: "surely it is in no wise possible for another god to go beyond or to make void the purpose of Zeus, lord of the aegis" (Odyssey V.3079-3080, trans. Butcher and Lang)

### Circe's Island

On the island of Aia, [Circe](../deities/circe.md) transforms Odysseus's men into swine with her drugs and wand, though "their mind abode even as of old."[^od10-swine] [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md) intercepts Odysseus, appearing "in the likeness of a young man with the first down on his lip," and gives him the herb moly as protection: "black at the root, but the flower was like to milk. Moly the gods call it, but it is hard for mortal men to dig; howbeit with the gods all things are possible."[^od10-moly]

When Odysseus resists her magic, [Circe](../deities/circe.md) recognises him at once because [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md) had foretold his coming: "Verily thou art Odysseus, ready at need, whom he of the golden wand, the slayer of Argos, full often told me was to come hither."[^od10-circe] After a year on Aia, [Circe](../deities/circe.md) directs him to the land of the dead to consult Teiresias, and upon his return delivers prophecies about the Sirens, Scylla, Charybdis, and the cattle of [Helius](../deities/helius.md).

[^od10-swine]: "their mind abode even as of old" (Odyssey X.5550-5551, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od10-moly]: "black at the root, but the flower was like to milk. Moly the gods call it, but it is hard for mortal men to dig; howbeit with the gods all things are possible" (Odyssey X.5612-5616, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od10-circe]: "Verily thou art Odysseus, ready at need, whom he of the golden wand, the slayer of Argos, full often told me was to come hither, on his way from Troy with his swift black ship" (Odyssey X.5645-5647, trans. Butcher and Lang)

### The Nekuia (Book XI)

In the land of the dead, Odysseus consults the shade of Teiresias, who prophesies the course of his return — [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md)'s continued wrath, the danger of [Helius](../deities/helius.md)'s cattle on Thrinacia, the slaying of the wooers, and a journey inland carrying an oar until he finds a people who know nothing of the sea, where he must sacrifice to [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md). Teiresias promises him a gentle death "from the sea" in old age.[^od11-teiresias]

He sees the shade of his mother Anticleia, "the daughter of Autolycus the great-hearted, whom I left alive when I departed for the sacred land of Ilios."[^od11-anticleia] He also encounters the shade of Achilles, to whom he speaks words of comfort that Achilles famously rejects.

[^od11-teiresias]: (Odyssey XI, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od11-anticleia]: "Anon came up the soul of my mother dead, Anticleia, the daughter of Autolycus the great-hearted, whom I left alive when I departed for the sacred land of Ilios" (Odyssey XI.5979-5980, trans. Butcher and Lang)

### Zeus's Omens and the Slaying of the Wooers

[Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) provides direct divine sanction for Odysseus's vengeance. When Odysseus prays for an omen, "Zeus, the counsellor, heard him. Straightway he thundered from shining Olympus."[^od20-thunder] Zeus thunders again when Odysseus strings the great bow: "Zeus thundered loud showing forth his tokens. And the steadfast goodly Odysseus was glad thereat."[^od21-thunder]

After the slaying, [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) decrees the final peace: "let them make a firm covenant together with sacrifice, and let him be king all his days, and let us bring about oblivion of the slaying of their children and their brethren."[^od24-peace]

[^od20-thunder]: "Zeus, the counsellor, heard him. Straightway he thundered from shining Olympus, from on high from the place of clouds; and goodly Odysseus was glad" (Odyssey XX.10858-10860, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od21-thunder]: "Zeus thundered loud showing forth his tokens. And the steadfast goodly Odysseus was glad thereat, in that the son of deep-counselling Cronos had sent him a sign" (Odyssey XXI.11618-11620, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od24-peace]: "let them make a firm covenant together with sacrifice, and let him be king all his days, and let us bring about oblivion of the slaying of their children and their brethren; so may both sides love one another as of old, and let peace and wealth abundant be their portion" (Odyssey XXIV.13036-13040, trans. Butcher and Lang)

## In the Epic Cycle

### The Wooden Horse (Little Iliad)

[Athena](../deities/athena.md) contrives that Odysseus wins Achilles' arms after Achilles' death, and instructs Epeius to build the Wooden Horse — the stratagem by which Troy finally falls. In the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md), the Horse is described as made "by the aid of Athene," and Odysseus is credited with the victory at Troy "by grace of great-hearted Athene."[^liliad-horse]

[^liliad-horse]: Little Iliad, summary by Proclus: "Odysseus, by the contriving of Athena, gains them... Epeius, by Athena's instruction, builds the wooden horse"

### Death by Telegonus (Telegony)

In the Telegony (attributed to Eugammon), after the events of the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md), Odysseus marries Callidice, queen of the Thesprotians, and leads them in war. "[Ares](../deities/ares.md) routs the army of Odysseus and [Athena](../deities/athena.md) engages with Ares, until [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) separates them."[^tel-war]

Telegonus, son of Odysseus and [Circe](../deities/circe.md), searching for his father, lands on Ithaca and ravages it. "Odysseus comes out to defend his country, but is killed by his son unwittingly."[^tel-death] Afterwards, [Circe](../deities/circe.md) makes Penelope and Telemachus immortal, and "Telegonus marries Penelope, and Telemachus Circe."[^tel-end]

[^tel-war]: Telegony, summary by Proclus: "Ares routs the army of Odysseus and Athena engages with Ares, until Apollo separates them" (trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^tel-death]: Telegony, summary by Proclus: "Odysseus comes out to defend his country, but is killed by his son unwittingly" (trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^tel-end]: Telegony, summary by Proclus: "Circe makes them immortal, and Telegonus marries Penelope, and Telemachus Circe" (trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
