## Overview

**Odysseus** is the king of Ithaca and protagonist of the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md). He is the foremost Greek hero of cunning and resourcefulness, favoured above all mortals by [Athena](../deities/athena.md) and opposed by [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md). [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) himself praises him: "how should I forget divine Odysseus, who in understanding is beyond mortals and beyond all men hath done sacrifice to the deathless gods?"[^od1-zeus-praise] Through [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md), his maternal grandfather Autolycus received the gifts of thievery and cunning from the god himself, and this divine favour passes into Odysseus's bloodline.[^od19-autolycus]

[^od1-zeus-praise]: "how should I forget divine Odysseus, who in understanding is beyond mortals and beyond all men hath done sacrifice to the deathless gods, who keep the wide heaven?" (Odyssey 1.70-73, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od19-autolycus]: "Autolycus, his mother's noble father, who outdid all men in thievery and skill in swearing. This skill was the gift of the god himself, even Hermes, for that he burned to him the well-pleasing sacrifice of the thighs of lambs and kids; wherefore Hermes abetted him gladly." (Odyssey 19.399-403, trans. Butcher and Lang)

## Appearance

The sources give an unusually full picture of Odysseus's physical form. On the walls of Troy, Priam observes him in the Greek ranks: "shorter by a head than Agamemnon son of Atreus, but broader of shoulder and of chest to behold," and likens him to "a thick-fleeced ram ordering a great flock of ewes."[^app-priam] Antenor, who had hosted both Odysseus and Menelaos as envoys, recalls that when standing, "Menelaos overpassed them all by the measure of his broad shoulders; but when both sat down, Odysseus was the more stately." Antenor then describes his manner of speaking: "whenever Odysseus full of wiles rose up, he stood and looked down, with eyes fixed upon the ground, and waved not his staff whether backwards or forwards, but held it stiff, like to a man of no understanding; one would deem him to be churlish, and naught but a fool. But when he uttered his great voice from his chest, and words like unto the snowflakes of winter, then could no mortal man contend with Odysseus."[^app-antenor]

For the night raid in [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) X, Odysseus wears a distinctive helmet with a storied provenance: "a helm made of leather, and with many a thong was it stiffly wrought within, while without the white teeth of a boar of flashing tusks were arrayed thick set on either side, well and cunningly, and in the midst was fixed a cap of felt." The helmet was originally stolen by his grandfather Autolykos and passed through several owners before reaching him.[^app-helmet]

[Athena](../deities/athena.md) repeatedly transforms his appearance throughout the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md). After he washes ashore on the Phaeacian coast, she "made him greater and more mighty to behold, and from his head caused deep curling locks to flow, like the hyacinth flower. And as when some skilful man overlays gold upon silver -- one that Hephaestus and Pallas Athene have taught all manner of craft, and full of grace is his handiwork -- even so did Athene shed grace about his head and shoulders."[^app-vi-beautify] She enhances him again before the Phaeacian games, making him "greater and more mighty to behold, that he might win love and worship and honour among all the Phaeacians."[^app-viii-beautify]

On Ithaca, Athena transforms him into a beggar: "His fair flesh she withered on his supple limbs, and made waste his yellow hair from off his head, and over all his limbs she cast the skin of an old man, and dimmed his two eyes, erewhile so fair. And she changed his raiment to a vile wrap and a doublet, torn garments and filthy, stained with foul smoke."[^app-beggar]

After the slaying of the wooers and his reunion with Penelope, Athena restores him with the same imagery used at Phaeacia: "Athene shed great beauty from his head downwards, and made him greater and more mighty to behold, and from his head caused deep curling locks to flow, like the hyacinth flower. And as when some skilful man overlays gold upon silver... even so did Athene shed grace about his head and shoulders, and forth from the bath he came, in form like to the immortals."[^app-xxiii-beautify]

[^app-priam]: "Come now, tell me of this man too, dear child, who is he, shorter by a head than Agamemnon son of Atreus, but broader of shoulder and of chest to behold? His armour lieth upon the bounteous earth, and himself like a bell-wether rangeth the ranks of warriors. Yea, I liken him to a thick-fleeced ram ordering a great flock of ewes." (Iliad 3.200-205, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^app-antenor]: "when they mingled with the Trojans in the assembly, while all stood up Menelaos overpassed them all by the measure of his broad shoulders; but when both sat down, Odysseus was the more stately... whenever Odysseus full of wiles rose up, he stood and looked down, with eyes fixed upon the ground, and waved not his staff whether backwards or forwards, but held it stiff, like to a man of no understanding; one would deem him to be churlish, and naught but a fool. But when he uttered his great voice from his chest, and words like unto the snowflakes of winter, then could no mortal man contend with Odysseus; then marvelled we not thus to behold Odysseus' aspect." (Iliad 3.216-229, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^app-helmet]: "on his head set a helm made of leather, and with many a thong was it stiffly wrought within, while without the white teeth of a boar of flashing tusks were arrayed thick set on either side, well and cunningly, and in the midst was fixed a cap of felt. This casque Autolykos once stole from Amyntor son of Ormenos, out of Eleon" (Iliad 10.262-267, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^app-vi-beautify]: "Athene, the daughter of Zeus, made him greater and more mighty to behold, and from his head caused deep curling locks to flow, like the hyacinth flower. And as when some skilful man overlays gold upon silver—one that Hephaestus and Pallas Athene have taught all manner of craft, and full of grace is his handiwork—even so did Athene shed grace about his head and shoulders." (Odyssey 6.232-237, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^app-viii-beautify]: "she made him greater and more mighty to behold, that he might win love and worship and honour among all the Phaeacians" (Odyssey 8.29-30, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^app-beggar]: "Athene touched him with her wand. His fair flesh she withered on his supple limbs, and made waste his yellow hair from off his head, and over all his limbs she cast the skin of an old man, and dimmed his two eyes, erewhile so fair. And she changed his raiment to a vile wrap and a doublet, torn garments and filthy, stained with foul smoke." (Odyssey 13.426-430, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^app-xxiii-beautify]: "Athene shed great beauty from his head downwards, and made him greater and more mighty to behold, and from his head caused deep curling locks to flow, like the hyacinth flower. And as when some skilful man overlays gold upon silver, one that Hephaestus and Pallas Athene have taught all manner of craft, and full of grace is his handiwork, even so did Athene shed grace about his head and shoulders, and forth from the bath he came, in form like to the immortals." (Odyssey 23.165-172, trans. Butcher and Lang)

## In the Iliad

### The Rallying of the Army (Book II)

When the Greeks rush to flee after Agamemnon's test, [Athena](../deities/athena.md) goes directly to Odysseus to rally the army. She addresses him as "Heaven-sprung son of Laertes, Odysseus of many devices, will ye indeed fling yourselves upon your benched ships to flee homeward to your dear native land?" He "knew the voice of the goddess" and through him [Athena](../deities/athena.md) restores order to the Greek host.[^il2-rally]

[^il2-rally]: "bright-eyed Athene stood by him and said: 'Heaven-sprung son of Laertes, Odysseus of many devices, will ye indeed fling yourselves upon your benched ships to flee homeward to your dear native land?'" (Iliad 2.174-176, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

### The Embassy to Achilles (Book IX)

Odysseus leads the embassy to Achilles in Book IX, delivering the formal offer of gifts and reconciliation from Agamemnon. Achilles addresses him directly: "son of Laertes, Odysseus of many wiles, in openness must I now declare my saying" — before refusing the embassy and revealing his two fates.[^il9-embassy]

[^il9-embassy]: "son of Laertes, Odysseus of many wiles, in openness must I now declare my saying" (Iliad 9.312, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

### The Night Raid with Diomedes (Book X)

In Book X, Odysseus and Diomedes undertake the night raid (Doloneia). [Athena](../deities/athena.md) guides them throughout — sending a heron omen, breathing might into Diomedes, standing as an evil dream over Rhesos, and warning them to retreat. Athena is called "the Giver of Spoil," and it is noted that "Pallas Athene loveth him" — referring to Odysseus.[^il10-raid]

[^il10-raid]: "Pallas Athene loveth him" (Iliad X, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

### Wounded and Protected (Book XI)

In Book XI, Odysseus is wounded by Sokos but [Athena](../deities/athena.md) protects him from a mortal blow, deflecting the spear so that it "did not suffer it to mingle with the bowels."[^il11-wound] [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) had sent the personified Discord to stand on Odysseus's ship in the centre of the Greek line, marking his position as the army's midpoint.[^il11-discord]

[^il11-wound]: "did not suffer it to mingle with the bowels" (Iliad XI, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il11-discord]: "she stood upon the huge black ship of Odysseus, that was in the midst, to make her voice heard on either side" (Iliad 11.9-11, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

### The Funeral Games (Book XXIII)

In the funeral games for Patroklos, [Athena](../deities/athena.md) aids Odysseus in the foot-race, making his limbs light and tripping Aias in ox-filth. Aias himself acknowledges the divine patronage: "the goddess who from of old like a mother standeth by Odysseus' side and helpeth him."[^il23-games]

[^il23-games]: "the goddess who from of old like a mother standeth by Odysseus' side and helpeth him" (Iliad 23.857-858, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

## In the Odyssey

### Athena's Patronage

The relationship between Odysseus and [Athena](../deities/athena.md) is the theological heart of the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md). She advocates for him before [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) at the poem's opening: "my heart is rent for wise Odysseus, that hapless one, who far from his friends this long while suffereth affliction in a seagirt isle."[^od1-advocate] She proposes the plan to free him from Calypso and goes herself to rouse his son Telemachus.

When they are reunited on Ithaca in Book XIII, [Athena](../deities/athena.md) delivers one of the poem's most remarkable speeches, binding patron and hero by kinship of mind: "both of us practised in deceits, for that thou art of all men far the first in counsel and in discourse, and I in the company of all the gods win renown for my wit and wile."[^od13-craft]

She explains her long absence: though she was "always by thee and guard thee in all adventures," she had "no mind to be at strife with [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md), my own father's brother."[^od13-poseidon]

Throughout the poem, [Athena](../deities/athena.md) transforms Odysseus at will with her wand — withering his skin and dimming his eyes to disguise him as a beggar, then restoring him with hyacinth curls and a form "greater and more mighty to behold."[^od6-beautify] She beautifies him for Nausicaa, for Penelope, and holds back Dawn itself so that husband and wife may have their night together.[^od23-dawn]

In the final battle, she appears as Mentor, chides Odysseus for feeble courage, then holds up her destroying [aegis](../objects/aegis.md) from the roof to rout the wooers.[^od22-aegis] The poem ends with [Athena](../deities/athena.md) setting the final covenant of peace "in the likeness of Mentor, both in fashion and in voice."[^od24-covenant]

[^od1-advocate]: "my heart is rent for wise Odysseus, that hapless one, who far from his friends this long while suffereth affliction in a seagirt isle" (Odyssey 1.55-57, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od13-craft]: "both of us practised in deceits, for that thou art of all men far the first in counsel and in discourse, and I in the company of all the gods win renown for my wit and wile" (Odyssey 13.295-297, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od13-poseidon]: "I had no mind to be at strife with Poseidon, my own father's brother" (Odyssey 13.334-336, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od6-beautify]: "Athene, the daughter of Zeus, made him greater and more mighty to behold, and from his head caused deep curling locks to flow, like the hyacinth flower" (Odyssey 6.233-235, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od23-dawn]: "the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, had other thoughts. The night she held long in the utmost West, and on the other side she stayed the golden-throned Dawn by the stream Oceanus, and suffered her not to harness the swift-footed steeds that bear light to men" (Odyssey 23.247-252, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od22-aegis]: "Athene held up her destroying aegis on high from the roof, and their minds were scared, and they fled through the hall, like a drove of kine that the flitting gadfly falls upon and scatters hither and thither in spring time" (Odyssey 22.302-304, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od24-covenant]: "Pallas Athene set a covenant between them with sacrifice, she, the daughter of Zeus lord of the aegis, in the likeness of Mentor, both in fashion and in voice" (Odyssey 24.562-564, trans. Butcher and Lang)

### Poseidon's Wrath

[Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) is Odysseus's primary divine antagonist. "All the gods had pity on him save Poseidon, who raged continually against godlike Odysseus, till he came to his own country."[^od1-rage] His anger stems from Odysseus blinding his son [Polyphemus](../creatures/cyclopes.md), who prayed: "Hear me, Poseidon, girdler of the earth, god of the dark hair, if indeed I be thine, and thou avowest thee my sire, -- grant that he may never come to his home, even Odysseus, waster of cities, the son of Laertes... late may he come in evil case, with the loss of all his company, in the ship of strangers, and find sorrows in his house." And "the god of the dark locks heard him."[^od9-prayer] This prayer exactly describes the course of Odysseus's return.

When [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) spots Odysseus near Phaeacia, he unleashes a full storm: "he gathered the clouds and troubled the waters of the deep, grasping his trident in his hands; and he roused all storms of all manner of winds." He smashes the raft with a great wave and departs with a final warning: "Even so, after all thy sufferings, go wandering over the deep."[^od5-storm]

[^od1-rage]: "all the gods had pity on him save Poseidon, who raged continually against godlike Odysseus, till he came to his own country" (Odyssey 1.27-29, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od9-prayer]: "Hear me, Poseidon, girdler of the earth, god of the dark hair, if indeed I be thine, and thou avowest thee my sire,—grant that he may never come to his home, even Odysseus, waster of cities, the son of Laertes, whose dwelling is in Ithaca; yet if he is ordained to see his friends and come unto his well-builded house, and his own country, late may he come in evil case, with the loss of all his company, in the ship of strangers, and find sorrows in his house... So he spake in prayer, and the god of the dark locks heard him" (Odyssey 9.523-532, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od5-storm]: "he gathered the clouds and troubled the waters of the deep, grasping his trident in his hands; and he roused all storms of all manner of winds, and shrouded in clouds the land and sea: and down sped night from heaven" (Odyssey 5.290-293, trans. Butcher and Lang)

### Calypso's Island

Odysseus is held for years on the island of Ogygia by the nymph [Calypso](../deities/calypso.md), "the daughter of the wizard [Atlas](../deities/atlas.md), who knows the depths of every sea, and himself upholds the tall pillars which keep earth and sky asunder."[^od1-calypso] When [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) commands his release, [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md) is sent to Calypso with the message. Hermes binds on his golden sandals, takes his wand, and flies "like the cormorant" over the waves to deliver [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md)'s command: "surely it is in no wise possible for another god to go beyond or to make void the purpose of Zeus, lord of the aegis."[^od5-hermes]

[^od1-calypso]: "the daughter of the wizard Atlas, who knows the depths of every sea, and himself upholds the tall pillars which keep earth and sky asunder" (Odyssey 1.61-63, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od5-hermes]: "surely it is in no wise possible for another god to go beyond or to make void the purpose of Zeus, lord of the aegis" (Odyssey 5.105-106, trans. Butcher and Lang)

### Circe's Island

On the island of Aia, [Circe](../deities/circe.md) transforms Odysseus's men into swine with her drugs and wand, though "their mind abode even as of old."[^od10-swine] [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md) intercepts Odysseus, appearing "in the likeness of a young man with the first down on his lip," and gives him the herb moly as protection: "black at the root, but the flower was like to milk. Moly the gods call it, but it is hard for mortal men to dig; howbeit with the gods all things are possible."[^od10-moly]

When Odysseus resists her magic, [Circe](../deities/circe.md) recognises him at once because [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md) had foretold his coming: "Verily thou art Odysseus, ready at need, whom he of the golden wand, the slayer of Argos, full often told me was to come hither."[^od10-circe] After a year on Aia, [Circe](../deities/circe.md) directs him to the land of the dead to consult Teiresias, and upon his return delivers prophecies about the Sirens, Scylla, Charybdis, and the cattle of [Helius](../deities/helius.md).

[^od10-swine]: "their mind abode even as of old" (Odyssey 10.238-239, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od10-moly]: "black at the root, but the flower was like to milk. Moly the gods call it, but it is hard for mortal men to dig; howbeit with the gods all things are possible" (Odyssey 10.299-303, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od10-circe]: "Verily thou art Odysseus, ready at need, whom he of the golden wand, the slayer of Argos, full often told me was to come hither, on his way from Troy with his swift black ship" (Odyssey 10.331-333, trans. Butcher and Lang)

### The Nekuia (Book XI)

In the land of the dead, Odysseus consults the shade of Teiresias, who prophesies the course of his return — [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md)'s continued wrath, the danger of [Helius](../deities/helius.md)'s cattle on Thrinacia, the slaying of the wooers, and a journey inland carrying an oar until he finds a people who know nothing of the sea, where he must sacrifice to [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md). Teiresias promises him a gentle death "from the sea" in old age.[^od11-teiresias]

He sees the shade of his mother Anticleia, "the daughter of Autolycus the great-hearted, whom I left alive when I departed for the sacred land of Ilios."[^od11-anticleia] He also encounters the shade of Achilles, to whom he speaks words of comfort that Achilles famously rejects.

[^od11-teiresias]: (Odyssey XI, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od11-anticleia]: "Anon came up the soul of my mother dead, Anticleia, the daughter of Autolycus the great-hearted, whom I left alive when I departed for the sacred land of Ilios" (Odyssey 11.87-88, trans. Butcher and Lang)

### The Bow of Eurytus and the Slaying of the Wooers

The great bow that Odysseus uses to slay the suitors was a gift from Iphitus, son of Eurytus. Odysseus and Iphitus met as young men in Messene: Odysseus had gone to recover sheep stolen by the Messenians, while Iphitus was searching for twelve lost brood mares. Iphitus "gave him the bow, which of old great Eurytus bare and had left at his death to his son in his lofty house. And Odysseus gave Iphitus a sharp sword and a mighty spear, for the beginning of a loving friendship."[^od21-bow] Iphitus was later murdered by [Heracles](heracles.md) despite being his guest. Odysseus never took the bow to war, but kept it at home as a memorial of his friend.[^od21-memorial]

[^od21-bow]: "he gave him the bow, which of old great Eurytus bare and had left at his death to his son in his lofty house. And Odysseus gave Iphitus a sharp sword and a mighty spear, for the beginning of a loving friendship" (Odyssey 21.32-35, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od21-memorial]: "goodly Odysseus would never take it with him on the black ships, as he went to the wars, but the bow was laid by at home in the halls as a memorial of a dear guest" (Odyssey 21.38-39)

[Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) provides direct divine sanction for Odysseus's vengeance. When Odysseus prays for an omen, "Zeus, the counsellor, heard him. Straightway he thundered from shining Olympus."[^od20-thunder] Zeus thunders again when Odysseus strings the great bow: "Zeus thundered loud showing forth his tokens. And the steadfast goodly Odysseus was glad thereat."[^od21-thunder]

After the slaying, [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) decrees the final peace: "let them make a firm covenant together with sacrifice, and let him be king all his days, and let us bring about oblivion of the slaying of their children and their brethren."[^od24-peace]

[^od20-thunder]: "Zeus, the counsellor, heard him. Straightway he thundered from shining Olympus, from on high from the place of clouds; and goodly Odysseus was glad" (Odyssey 20.99-101, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od21-thunder]: "Zeus thundered loud showing forth his tokens. And the steadfast goodly Odysseus was glad thereat, in that the son of deep-counselling Cronos had sent him a sign" (Odyssey 21.409-411, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od24-peace]: "let them make a firm covenant together with sacrifice, and let him be king all his days, and let us bring about oblivion of the slaying of their children and their brethren; so may both sides love one another as of old, and let peace and wealth abundant be their portion" (Odyssey 24.485-489, trans. Butcher and Lang)

## In the Epic Cycle

### The Wooden Horse (Little Iliad)

[Athena](../deities/athena.md) contrives that Odysseus wins Achilles' arms after Achilles' death, and instructs Epeius to build the Wooden Horse — the stratagem by which Troy finally falls. In the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md), the Horse is described as made "by the aid of Athene," and Odysseus is credited with the victory at Troy "by grace of great-hearted Athene."[^liliad-horse]

[^liliad-horse]: Little Iliad, summary by Proclus: "Odysseus, by the contriving of Athena, gains them... Epeius, by Athena's instruction, builds the wooden horse"

### Death by Telegonus (Telegony)

In the Telegony (attributed to Eugammon), after the events of the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md), Odysseus marries Callidice, queen of the Thesprotians, and leads them in war. "[Ares](../deities/ares.md) routs the army of Odysseus and [Athena](../deities/athena.md) engages with Ares, until [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) separates them."[^tel-war]

Telegonus, son of Odysseus and [Circe](../deities/circe.md), searching for his father, lands on Ithaca and ravages it. "Odysseus comes out to defend his country, but is killed by his son unwittingly."[^tel-death] Afterwards, [Circe](../deities/circe.md) makes Penelope and Telemachus immortal, and "Telegonus marries Penelope, and Telemachus Circe."[^tel-end]

[^tel-war]: Telegony, summary by Proclus: "Ares routs the army of Odysseus and Athena engages with Ares, until Apollo separates them" (trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^tel-death]: Telegony, summary by Proclus: "Odysseus comes out to defend his country, but is killed by his son unwittingly" (trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^tel-end]: Telegony, summary by Proclus: "Circe makes them immortal, and Telegonus marries Penelope, and Telemachus Circe" (trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## In the Bibliotheca (3.10.8-3.10.9, E.3-E.7)

### The Oath of the Suitors

When the kings of Greece came to woo [Helen](helen.md), Odysseus proposed the oath that all suitors would defend whichever man was chosen. In return, Tyndareus helped him win Penelope.[^apd-od-oath]

### Feigned Madness

When the Greeks mustered for Troy, Odysseus feigned madness to avoid the war. Palamedes proved the deception by snatching Telemachus from Penelope's arms and drawing his sword as if to kill the boy — "in his fear for the child Ulysses confessed that his madness was pretended, and he went to the war."[^apd-od-madness] Odysseus later took revenge by framing Palamedes for treason.[^apd-od-palamedes]

### The War and the Fall

Odysseus stole the Palladium from Troy with [Diomedes](diomedes.md).[^apd-od-palladium] He invented the Wooden Horse and persuaded the bravest to enter it; at the inscription he wrote: "For their return home, the Greeks dedicate this thank-offering to [Athena](../deities/athena.md)." When Helen circled the horse imitating the voices of the Greek wives, "Anticlus would have answered" but Odysseus held his mouth shut.[^apd-od-horse]

### The Return

The Epitome summarizes the whole Odyssey: the Cicones, Lotus-eaters, Polyphemus (origin of [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md)'s wrath), Aeolus, the Laestrygones, [Circe](../deities/circe.md) (fathered Telegonus), the Underworld, [Sirens](../creatures/sirens.md), [Scylla](../creatures/scylla.md) and Charybdis, the cattle of the Sun, Calypso, the Phaeacians, and the slaughter of the suitors.[^apd-od-return]

### Death

Telegonus, learning from Circe that he was Odysseus's son, sailed to Ithaca. When he drove off some cattle and Odysseus defended them, "Telegonus wounded him with the spear he had in his hands, which was barbed with the spine of a sting-ray, and Ulysses died of the wound." Telegonus then married Penelope, and Circe sent them both to the Islands of the Blest.[^apd-od-death]

[^apd-od-madness]: "in his fear for the child Ulysses confessed that his madness was pretended, and he went to the war" (Epitome 3.7, trans. J.G. Frazer)

[^apd-od-palamedes]: "Ulysses compelled him to write a letter of treasonable purport ostensibly sent by Priam to Palamedes; and having buried gold in the quarters of Palamedes, he dropped the letter in the camp" (Epitome 3.8, trans. J.G. Frazer)

## In the Fabulae

### Feigned Madness (§95)

The [Fabulae](../sources/hyginus.md) provides the fullest account of Odysseus's attempt to avoid the Trojan War. "When Agamemnon and Menelaus, son of Atreus, were assembling the leaders who had pledged themselves to attack Troy, they came to the island of Ithaca to Ulysses, son of Laertes. He had been warned by an oracle that if he went to Troy he would return home alone and in need, with his comrades lost, after twenty years."[^hyg-95-oracle]

The deception is vivid: "when he learned that spokesmen would come to him, he put on a cap, pretending madness, and yoked a horse and an ox to the plow."[^hyg-95-plow] Palamedes saw through it: "taking his son Telemachus from the cradle, put him in front of the plow with the words: 'Give up your pretense and come and join the allies.' Then Ulysses promised that he would come; from that time he was hostile to Palamedes."[^hyg-95-palamedes]

[^hyg-95-oracle]: "He had been warned by an oracle that if he went to Troy he would return home alone and in need, with his comrades lost, after twenty years" (Fabulae §95, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-95-plow]: "when he learned that spokesmen would come to him, he put on a cap, pretending madness, and yoked a horse and an ox to the plow" (Fabulae §95, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-95-palamedes]: "Palamedes felt he was pretending when he saw this, and taking his son Telemachus from the cradle, put him in front of the plow with the words: 'Give up your pretense and come and join the allies.' Then Ulysses promised that he would come; from that time he was hostile to Palamedes" (Fabulae §95, trans. Mary Grant)

### The Murder of Palamedes (§105)

Odysseus's revenge is told with clinical detail. "Ulysses, because he had been tricked by Palamedes, son of Nauplius, kept plotting day by day how to kill him."[^hyg-105-plotting] The scheme was elaborate:

"He sent a soldier of his to Agamemnon to say that in a dream he had been warned that the camp should be moved for one day. Agamemnon, believing the warning true, gave orders that the camp be moved for one day."[^hyg-105-camp] While the camp was relocated, "Ulysses, then, secretly by night hid a great quantity of gold in the place where the tent of Palamedes had been."[^hyg-105-gold]

Simultaneously, "he also gave to a Phrygian captive a letter to be carried to Priam, and sent a soldier of his ahead to kill him not far from the camp."[^hyg-105-letter] The forged letter was found: "Written on it were the words: 'Sent to Palamedes from Priam,' and it promised him as much gold as Ulysses had hidden in the tent, if he would betray the camp of Agamemnon according to agreement."[^hyg-105-contents]

"When Palamedes was brought before the king, and so denied the deed, they went to his tent and dug up the gold. Agamemnon believed the charge was true when he saw the gold. In this way Palamedes was tricked by the scheme of Ulysses, and though innocent, was put to death by the entire army."[^hyg-105-death]

### The Odyssey Compressed (§125)

Hyginus provides a remarkable summary of the entire [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md), including unique details. After leaving Troy, Odysseus was "carried by a storm to the Cicones. He attacked their town, Ismarus, and distributed the spoils among his comrades."[^hyg-125-cicones]

Key episodes with variants:

- **Polyphemus**: The prophecy is preserved: "a prophecy had been given by the augur Telemus, son of Eurymus, that he should beware of being blinded by Ulysses."[^hyg-125-prophecy] When Odysseus gave wine to Polyphemus, "he said that he was called Noman. And so, when Ulysses was burning out his eye with a glowing stake, he summoned the other Cyclopes with is cries, and called to them from the closed cave, 'Noman in blinding me!' They thought he was speaking in sport, and did not heed."[^hyg-125-noman]
- **Circe**: "When he sent Eurylochus to her with twenty-two of his men, she changed them from human form; but Eurylochus in fear did not enter, but fled and reported to Ulysses."[^hyg-125-eurylochus] Mercury's intervention: "Ulysses himself alone went to her, but on the way Mercury gave him a charm, and showed him how to deceive Circe."[^hyg-125-mercury]
- **The Cattle of the Sun**: "There flesh lowed when his comrades cooked it in a brazen kettle."[^hyg-125-flesh] The detail is repeated twice in the fable for emphasis.
- **Recognition**: "When a raft had been made there, Calypso sent him off with an abundance of provisions, but Neptune shattered the raft with his waves because he had blinded his son, the Cyclops."[^hyg-125-neptune]

[^hyg-125-cicones]: "When Ulysses was returning from Troy to his country Ithaca, he was carried by a storm to the Cicones. He attacked their town, Ismarus, and distributed the spoils among his comrades" (Fabulae §125, trans. Mary Grant)

And so, when Ulysses was burning out his eye with a glowing stake, he summoned the other Cyclopes with is cries, and called to them from the closed cave, 'Noman in blinding me!' They thought he was speaking in sport, and did not heed" (Fabulae §125, trans. Mary Grant)

[^hyg-125-neptune]: "When a raft had been made there, Calypso sent him off with an abundance of provisions, but Neptune shattered the raft with his waves because he had blinded his son, the Cyclops" (Fabulae §125, trans. Mary Grant)

### Death by Telegonus (§127)

The [Fabulae](../sources/hyginus.md) preserves the Telegony's ending. "Telegonus, son of Ulysses and Circe, sent by his mother to find his father, by a storm was carried to Ithaca, and there, driven by hunger, began to lay waste the fields."[^hyg-127-arrival] Odysseus and Telemachus, "not knowing who he was, took up arms against him. Ulysses was killed by his son Telegonus; it had been told him by an oracle to beware of death at his son's hands."[^hyg-127-death]

The aftermath mirrors the tangled genealogies of the [Epic Cycle](../sources/epic-cycle.md): "Telegonus on discovering who he was, with Telemachus and Penelope returned to his home on the island of Aeaea by Minerva's instructions. They brought the body of Ulysses to Circe, and buried it there. By the advice of Minerva again, Telegonus married Penelope, and Telemachus married Circe."[^hyg-127-marriages]

The fable ends with an aetiology: "From Circe and Telemachus Latinus was born, who gave his name to the Latin language; from Penelope and Telegonus Italus was born, who called the country Italy from his own name."[^hyg-127-aetiology]

[^hyg-127-arrival]: "Telegonus, son of Ulysses and Circe, sent by his mother to find his father, by a storm was carried to Ithaca, and there, driven by hunger, began to lay waste the fields" (Fabulae §127, trans. Mary Grant)

## In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md)

### The Contest of Arms (13.128-381)

After [Ajax](ajax.md) claims [Achilles](achilles.md)' arms by kinship and battlefield valour, Odysseus rises to make his counter-speech. He first matches Ajax's genealogy — "the founder of my family, you know, is Jupiter; by birth I am just the same degree removed from Jupiter as he" — and dismisses blood-claims entirely: "Let personal merit weigh the cause alone."[^met-od-birth]

Odysseus argues that he, not Ajax, brought Achilles to the war: "Achilles' Nereid mother, who foresaw his death, concealed her son by change of dress. By that disguise Ajax, among the rest, was well deceived. I showed with women's wares arms that might win the spirit of a man."[^met-od-achilles] He claims credit for persuading Agamemnon to sacrifice Iphigenia at Aulis ("I turned, by tactful words, a father's tender heart to the great issue of the public weal"), for the embassy to Troy demanding Helen's return, and for rallying the fleeing Greeks when Agamemnon tested their resolve.[^met-od-aulis]

He recounts the night raid with [Diomedes](diomedes.md) — slaying Dolon and Rhesus — and catalogues warriors he killed in open battle, showing his chest wounds: "Here is a breast that bled for you! But Ajax never shed a drop of blood to aid his friends, in all these many years."[^met-od-wounds] His most powerful claim is carrying Achilles' body from the field: "I carried his dead body from the ground, uplifted on these shoulders... I have the strength to walk beneath their weight, I have a mind to understand their worth."[^met-od-body]

He concludes by invoking the theft of the Palladium: "In spite of hostile swords, he goes within not only the strong walls of Troy but even the citadel, lifts up the goddess from her shrine, and takes her through the enemy!" He closes by pointing to [Athena](../deities/athena.md)'s statue: "if you do not give these arms to me, then give them all to her!"[^met-od-palladium]

The assembled chiefs are swayed, and the arms go to Odysseus.[^met-od-verdict]

### Fetching Philoctetes and the Fall of Troy (13.399-403)

After Ajax's suicide, Odysseus "set sail, for Lemnos" to bring back Philoctetes and the arrows of [Heracles](heracles.md). "When these were given back to the Greeks, their lord with them, a final hand at last prevailed to end that long fought war."[^met-od-lemnos]

### Hecuba as Prize (13.399-568)

In the aftermath of Troy's fall, Odysseus claimed Hecuba as his prize "only because she had brought Hector forth." He dragged her from among the tombs of her sons, where she embraced their urns; "Ulysses came with ruthless hands and bore her off."[^met-od-hecuba]

[^met-od-birth]: "the founder of my family, you know, is Jupiter; by birth I am just the same degree removed from Jupiter as he... Let personal merit weigh the cause alone" (Metamorphoses 13.140-149, trans. Brookes More)

[^met-od-body]: "I carried his dead body from the ground, uplifted on these shoulders, I repeat, upon these shoulders from that ground I bore off dead Achilles, and those arms which now I want to bear away again. I have the strength to walk beneath their weight, I have a mind to understand their worth" (Metamorphoses 13.284-294, trans. Brookes More)

[^met-od-hecuba]: "The conquering Ulysses only claimed her his because she had brought Hector forth... Ulysses came with ruthless hands and bore her off, his prize" (Metamorphoses 13.481-497, trans. Brookes More)

## In the [Achilleid](../sources/achilleid.md)

Statius portrays Odysseus as the mastermind behind retrieving [Achilles](achilles.md) from [Scyros](../places/scyros.md). After [Calchas](calchas.md)' prophetic frenzy reveals that [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md) has hidden Achilles among the daughters of Lycomedes, [Diomedes](diomedes.md) volunteers to accompany him: "Do thou but keep alert the cunning and foresight of thy watchful mind, and arouse thy fertile craft: no prophet, methinks, would make bold in perplexity to see the truth before thee."[^ach-diomedes-praise]

Odysseus sails to Scyros with Diomedes and employs his characteristic cunning. He first gains entry to Lycomedes' palace under a false pretence, claiming they have come "to spy out the approaches to Troy." During the banquet he scans the maidens with "intent gaze," searching for one whose features betray a disguise. He spots a figure "with head erect and wandering gaze, one who preserves no sign of virgin modesty."[^ach-scan]

The discovery itself is a trap of Odysseus's design: Diomedes sets out gifts among the princesses — wands, timbrels, jewels — but mixed among them are a shield and spear. The maidens reach for ornaments, but Achilles seizes the weapons. Odysseus goes to his side and whispers: "Why dost thou hesitate? We know thee, thou art the pupil of the half-beast Chiron, thou art the grandson of the sky and sea." A trumpet blast confirms the revelation, and Achilles stands revealed — "he seemed to surpass by head and shoulders the Ithacan and the Aetolian chief."[^ach-reveal]

On the voyage to Troy, Odysseus comforts the love-struck Achilles with a speech designed to stoke his martial pride, painting vivid pictures of glory and reminding him that [Deidamia](deidamia.md) is safer in his absence than she would be if some enemy came to "carry off Deidamia from her native shores."[^ach-speech]

[^ach-diomedes-praise]: "Do thou but keep alert the cunning and foresight of thy watchful mind, and arouse thy fertile craft: no prophet, methinks, would make bold in perplexity to see the truth before thee" (Achilleid 1.539-542, trans. J.H. Mozley)
[^ach-scan]: "Ulysses with intent gaze ponder carefully both forms and features... One nevertheless with head erect and wandering gaze, one who preserves no sign of virgin modesty, he marks" (Achilleid 1.758-766, trans. J.H. Mozley)
[^ach-reveal]: "Why dost thou hesitate? We know thee, thou art the pupil of the half-beast Chiron, thou art the grandson of the sky and sea... he seemed to surpass by head and shoulders the Ithacan and the Aetolian chief" (Achilleid 1.866-880, trans. J.H. Mozley)
[^ach-speech]: Achilleid 2.49-85. Odysseus comforts and inspires Achilles on the voyage to Troy.

## In Sophocles' [Ajax](../sources/sophocles-ajax.md)

### Pity for the Maddened Ajax

In the prologue, [Athena](../deities/athena.md) reveals to Odysseus what [Ajax](ajax.md) has done in the night — slaughtering livestock in a frenzy, believing them the Greek commanders. She summons the still-deranged Ajax to display his madness. Despite their bitter rivalry, Odysseus responds with pity rather than triumph: "I pity him, for all that he is my foe, seeing he is bound fast to a dreadful doom. I think of mine own lot no less than his. For I see well, none of us that live are more than phantoms all, or empty shadow."[^soph-od-pity]

### Magnanimity in the Burial Dispute

After Ajax's suicide, [Menelaus](menelaus.md) and [Agamemnon](agamemnon.md) attempt to deny Ajax burial. [Teucer](teucer.md) defends his brother but cannot overcome the two kings' authority. Odysseus arrives and surprises everyone by arguing for burial, telling Agamemnon: "Be not so hard thus without ruth tombless to cast him forth; nor be so vanquished by a vehement will, that to thy hate even Justice' self must bow." He acknowledges Ajax was his worst enemy, but insists: "save Achilles' self, I have not seen so noble an Argive on the fields of Troy."[^soph-od-noble] When Agamemnon resists, Odysseus delivers the play's central moral: "Hatred gives way to magnanimity."[^soph-od-mag]

Agamemnon yields reluctantly. Teucer praises Odysseus as "best of men" — his "worst thought" of Odysseus "foiled by thy staunch kindness to the man who was thy rancorous foe" — but declines his offer to help with the rites, fearing it might offend Ajax's spirit. Odysseus accepts gracefully.[^soph-od-best]

[^soph-od-pity]: "I pity him, for all that he is my foe, seeing he is bound fast to a dreadful doom. I think of mine own lot no less than his. For I see well, none of us that live are more than phantoms all, or empty shadow" (Sophocles, Ajax, trans. Lewis Campbell)
[^soph-od-noble]: "save Achilles' self, I have not seen so noble an Argive on the fields of Troy. Then 'twere not just in thee to slight him now" (Sophocles, Ajax)
[^soph-od-mag]: "Hatred gives way to magnanimity" (Sophocles, Ajax)
[^soph-od-best]: "Odysseus, best of men, thine every word hath my heart's praise, and my worst thought of thee is foiled by thy staunch kindness to the man who was thy rancorous foe" (Sophocles, Ajax)

## In Sophocles' [Philoctetes](../sources/sophocles-philoctetes.md)

### The Architect of Deception

Odysseus devises the plan to retrieve [Philoctetes](philoctetes.md) and [Heracles'](heracles.md) bow from [Lemnos](../places/lemnos.md). He instructs [Neoptolemus](neoptolemus.md) to deceive Philoctetes with a false story, telling the reluctant youth: "Words and not deeds give mastery over men."[^soph-od-phil-words] He cannot approach Philoctetes himself — "I was the man who set thee on this shore" — so he remains hidden while Neoptolemus works the deception.

When the plan falters and Neoptolemus's conscience revolts, Odysseus intervenes directly. He claims divine sanction: "'Tis Zeus, I tell thee, monarch of this isle, who thus hath willed. I am his minister."[^soph-od-phil-zeus] He declares Philoctetes himself dispensable — the bow is what matters: "What further use of thee, when we have ta'en these arms? Have we not Teucer, skilled in this mystery?"[^soph-od-phil-teucer]

### Defeated by Honour

When Neoptolemus returns to give back the bow, Odysseus threatens him with the army's punishment. But Neoptolemus stands firm, and when Odysseus reaches for his sword, he backs down — retreating to report to the army instead. He reappears once more to protest when Neoptolemus hands over the bow, but Philoctetes aims an arrow at him and he flees. The play thus shows Odysseus's pragmatic cunning defeated by the combination of Neoptolemus's honour and Philoctetes' fury.

[^soph-od-phil-words]: "Words and not deeds give mastery over men" (Sophocles, Philoctetes, trans. Lewis Campbell)
[^soph-od-phil-zeus]: "'Tis Zeus, I tell thee, monarch of this isle, / Who thus hath willed. I am his minister" (Sophocles, Philoctetes)
[^soph-od-phil-teucer]: "What further use of thee, / When we have ta'en these arms? Have we not Teucer, / Skilled in this mystery?" (Sophocles, Philoctetes)

## In the [Posthomerica](../sources/posthomerica.md)

### Defence of Achilles' Body (Book III)

When [Achilles](achilles.md) has fallen and the Greeks fight to recover his body, Odysseus joins [Ajax](ajax.md) at the centre of the struggle. He kills Maenalus ("Peisander's fleetfoot son, / The warrior Maenalus, who left his home / In far-renowned Abydos"), Atymnius (son of the bright-haired Nymph Pegasis and Emathion, born by [Granicus](../places/granicus.md)' stream), and Proteus (son of Orestius, "who dwelt 'neath lofty Ida's folds").[^post-b3-kills] During the fighting, Alcon, son of Megacles, drives his spear into Odysseus's right knee, drawing dark blood — but Odysseus does not leave the field. He kills Alcon through the shield with his own spear and fights on through the wound.[^post-b3-wound]

[^post-b3-kills]: "As he smote down Peisander's fleetfoot son, / The warrior Maenalus, who left his home / In far-renowned Abydos: down on him / He hurled Atymnius, the goodly son / Whom Pegasis the bright-haired Nymph had borne / To strong Emathion by Granicus' stream. / Dead by his side he laid Orestius' son, / Proteus, who dwelt 'neath lofty Ida's folds" (Posthomerica 3.2637-2644, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post-b3-wound]: "Yet Alcon, son of Megacles battle-swift, / Hard by Odysseus' right knee drave the spear / Home, and about the glittering greave the blood / Dark-crimson welled. He recked not of the wound, / But was unto his smiter sudden death; / For clear through his shield he stabbed him with his spear / Amidst his battle-fury... Rushed on his comrades, in his wound's despite, / Odysseus, nor from that stern battle-toil / Refrained him" (Posthomerica 3.2650-2665, trans. A.S. Way)

### The Funeral Games and the Wound (Book IV)

At Achilles' funeral games, Odysseus is prevented from competing by the knee wound Alcon dealt him during the battle over the body: he "inly grieved to be withheld / From contests of the strong, how fain soe'er, / By that sore wound which Alcon dealt to him / In the grim fight around dead Aeacas' son."[^post-b4-wound]

[^post-b4-wound]: "the son of the old war-lord, / Laertes, inly grieved to be withheld / From contests of the strong, how fain soe'er, / By that sore wound which Alcon dealt to him / In the grim fight around dead Aeacas' son" (Posthomerica 4.3937-3940, trans. A.S. Way)

### The Judgment of the Arms (Book V)

After Thetis sets Achilles' divine armour as a prize for the hero who most deserved it, both Ajax and Odysseus claim the arms. Ajax proposes the three senior leaders — [Idomeneus](../heroes/idomeneus.md), Nestor, and [Agamemnon](../heroes/agamemnon.md) — as judges; Odysseus agrees, calling them "prudent of their wit / ... and princeliest of all Danaan men."[^post-b5-agree] Nestor persuades the three leaders to instead put the question to Trojan captives, who as prisoners of both heroes will have no favouritism; Agamemnon consents.[^post-b5-nestor]

Ajax speaks first, calling Odysseus a "craven and a weakling wretch / Frail in comparison of me, as is / A cur beside a lion thunder-voiced," accusing him of shirking at the start of the war, of abandoning Philoctetes on Lemnos, of conspiring against Palamedes, and of placing his ships in the protected centre of the fleet from cowardice.[^post-b5-ajax-speech]

Odysseus responds, asserting superiority in "wit and speech, which things increase / The strength of men," and argues that it was he who brought Achilles to the war in the first place, who infiltrated Troy's walls as a spy with scarred body, who bore Achilles' body from the field, and who was never in flight. He also draws attention to his still-festering wound: "my grievous hurt / With pain still vexeth me, the wound I gat / In fighting for these arms and their slain lord."[^post-b5-od-speech]

The Trojan captives judge in favour of Odysseus, awarding him the arms; the text notes that "Greatly his soul rejoiced." Ajax in consequence is struck with madness.[^post-b5-verdict]

[^post-b5-agree]: "To these I also trust most utterly, / Odysseus said, for prudent of their wit / Be these, and princeliest of all Danaan men" (Posthomerica 5.4110-4112, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post-b5-nestor]: "Therefore let us ordain to judge this cause / 'Twixt godlike Aias and war-fain Odysseus, / Our Trojan captives. They shall say whom most / Our foes dread, and who saved Peleides' corse / From that most deadly fight" (Posthomerica 5.4137-4141, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post-b5-ajax-speech]: "Thy dam / Bare thee a craven and a weakling wretch / Frail in comparison of me, as is / A cur beside a lion thunder-voiced! / No battle-biding heart is in thy breast, / But wiles and treachery be all thy care" (Posthomerica 5.4171-4176, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post-b5-od-speech]: "I boast me better far / Than thou in wit and speech, which things increase / The strength of men... my grievous hurt / With pain still vexeth me, the wound I gat / In fighting for these arms and their slain lord. / In me as in Achilles is Zeus' blood" (Posthomerica 5.4239-4297, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post-b5-verdict]: "The sons of Troy gave judgment. Victory / And those immortal arms awarded they / With one consent to Odysseus mighty in war. / Greatly his soul rejoiced" (Posthomerica 5.4333-4336, trans. A.S. Way)

### Fetching Neoptolemus from Scyros (Book VII)

After [Eurypylus](../heroes/eurypylus.md) inflicts heavy losses on the Greeks, Calchas prophecies that they must bring [Neoptolemus](../heroes/neoptolemus.md) from [Scyros](../places/scyros.md). Odysseus sails there with [Diomedes](diomedes.md).[^post-b7-sent] Finding Neoptolemus training in arms outside the palace, they are struck by his resemblance to his father. Odysseus speaks first, identifying himself and offering gifts: Achilles' own armour ("these be like no mortal's battle-gear, / But splendid as the very War-god's arms"), and the promise of a royal marriage with [Menelaus](../heroes/menelaus.md)' daughter.[^post-b7-speech] The widowed [Deidamia](../heroes/deidamia.md) lies awake that night, bearing in mind "the names / Of crafty Odysseus and of Diomede / The godlike, how these twain had widowed her / Of battle-fain Achilles, how their words / Had won his aweless heart to fare with them / To meet the war-cry where stern Fate met him."[^post-b7-deidamia]

[^post-b7-sent]: "Meanwhile the black ship on to Scyros ran" (Posthomerica 7.5716, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post-b7-speech]: "Of Ithaca am I... sent by voice of prophecy. / I pray thee, pity us: come thou to Troy / And help us... I myself / Will give to thee thy godlike father's arms... these be like no mortal's battle-gear, / But splendid as the very War-god's arms" (Posthomerica 7.5736-5748, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post-b7-deidamia]: "she bore in mind the names / Of crafty Odysseus and of Diomede / The godlike, how these twain had widowed her / Of battle-fain Achilles, how their words / Had won his aweless heart to fare with them / To meet the war-cry where stern Fate met him" (Posthomerica 7.5805-5810, trans. A.S. Way)

### Fetching Philoctetes from Lemnos (Book IX)

At Calchas' counsel, Agamemnon sends Odysseus and Diomedes by sea to [Lemnos](../places/lemnos.md) to retrieve [Philoctetes](../heroes/philoctetes.md), whose presence and the bow of Heracles are required for Troy to fall.[^post-b9-sent] They find Philoctetes in his cave, emaciated and clothed in feathers from the birds he has shot, his ulcerous wound never ceasing to fester. When the heroes approach, Philoctetes springs for his bow — he recognizes them as those who abandoned him years before — but Athena dissolves his wrath before he shoots.[^post-b9-arrival] The two sit down on either side of him and speak words of comfort, deflecting blame for his abandonment onto the Fates rather than themselves: "no man of them all / Was cause of thine affliction, but the Fates, / The cruel ones, whom none that walk the earth / Escape."[^post-b9-speech] Persuaded, Philoctetes goes gladly with them to the ship, and they bear him leaning on their arms to the shore.[^post-b9-departure]

[^post-b9-sent]: "unto Lemnos, land / Of stately mansions, sent they Tydeus' son / And battle-staunch Odysseus oversea" (Posthomerica 9.7329-7331, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post-b9-arrival]: "Now when that solitary spied these twain / Draw nigh his cave, he sprang to his bow, he laid / The deadly arrow on the string; for now / Fierce memory of his wrongs awoke against / These, who had left him years agone, in pain / Groaning upon the desolate sea-shore. / Yea, and his heart's stem will he had swiftly wrought, / But, even as upon that godlike twain / He gazed, Athena caused his bitter wrath / To melt away" (Posthomerica 9.7401-7410, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post-b9-speech]: "no man of them all / Was cause of thine affliction, but the Fates, / The cruel ones, whom none that walk the earth / Escape, but aye they visit hapless men / Unseen... Hearkening he sat / To Odysseus and to godlike Diomede" (Posthomerica 9.7420-7428, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post-b9-departure]: "Straight to the strand dull-thundering and the ship, / Laughing for joy, they bare him with his bow" (Posthomerica 9.7432-7433, trans. A.S. Way)

### The Wooden Horse (Book XII)

After years of futile siege, Calchas calls the Greek chiefs together and advises that only guile, not force, will take Troy. It is Odysseus — "Laertes' son / Discerned it of his wisdom" — who proposes the stratagem: a great wooden horse to be built, filled with the best warriors, while the fleet sails away to [Tenedos](../places/tenedos.md). A brave man unknown to the Trojans will wait outside the horse and tell a prepared story — that the Greeks have sailed home and left the horse as an offering to Athena. When Troy sleeps, the man outside will give a torch-signal to the fleet; the warriors inside will hear the cry "Come forth the Horse!" and pour out to sack the city.[^post-b12-plan]

Calchas praises the scheme: "Let your hearts seek none other stratagem, / Friends; to war-strong Odysseus' rede give ear. / His wise thought shall not miss accomplishment."[^post-b12-calchas] When [Neoptolemus](../heroes/neoptolemus.md) protests that brave men fight face to face and not by trickery, Odysseus reminds him that even his father's invincible might never broke Troy's walls, and that Epeius the craftsman, guided by Athena, should build the horse.[^post-b12-reply]

Odysseus is among the warriors listed entering the horse, third after Neoptolemus and Menelaus.[^post-b12-entry] Inside the horse, when Sinon's torch-signal is given and the Trojans lie drunk and asleep, the warriors hear and press to leap out — but Odysseus in his subtlety holds them back from surging forth all at once. He is first to slip out himself, scanning from the opened flank of the horse "as when a wolf, / With hunger stung to the heart, comes from the hills, / And ravenous for flesh draws nigh the flock / Penned in the wide fold, slinking past the men / And dogs that watch... / So stole Odysseus down from the Horse."[^post-b12-exit]

[^post-b12-plan]: "A great Horse let us fashion, in the which / Our mightiest shall take ambush. Let the host / Burn all their tents, and sail from hence away / To Tenedos... Let some brave man, unknown of any in Troy, / With a stout heart abide without the Horse... Then shall war's signal unto us be given— / To them at sea, by sudden flash of torch, / To the ambush, by the cry, 'Come forth the Horse!' / When unsuspecting sleep the sons of Troy" (Posthomerica 12.8745-8764, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post-b12-calchas]: "Let your hearts seek none other stratagem, / Friends; to war-strong Odysseus' rede give ear. / His wise thought shall not miss accomplishment" (Posthomerica 12.8771-8773, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post-b12-reply]: "thine invincible sire's unquailing might / Availed not to smite Priam's wealthy burg, / Nor we, for all our travail. Nay, with speed, / As counselleth Calchas, go we to the ships, / And fashion we the Horse by Epeius' hands, / Who in the woodwright's craft is chiefest far / Of Argives, for Athena taught his lore" (Posthomerica 12.8799-8805, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post-b12-entry]: "Into that cavernous Horse Achilles' son / First entered, strong Menelaus followed then, / Odysseus, Sthenelus, godlike Diomede..." (Posthomerica 12.9070-9072, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post-b12-exit]: "They heard, and to Odysseus all inclined / Their ears: he bade them urgently go forth / Softly and fearlessly... in his subtlety / He stayed them from all thrusting eagerly forth. / But first himself with swift unfaltering hands... / A little he raised his head, and gazed around / On all sides, if he haply might descry / One Trojan waking yet. As when a wolf... / So stole Odysseus down from the Horse" (Posthomerica 13.9418-9435, trans. A.S. Way)

### The Sack of Troy and Hecuba (Books XIII–XIV)

Odysseus leads the heroes out of the horse after Sinon's signal (see above), restraining them from rushing forth all at once. In the aftermath of Troy's fall, [Hecuba](../heroes/hecuba.md) falls to him as his prize: "Hecuba / Odysseus dragged unto his ship. The tears / Poured from her eyes as water from a spring; / Trembled her limbs, fear-frenzied was her heart; / Rent were her hoary tresses and besprent / With ashes of the hearth."[^post-b14-hecuba]

[^post-b14-hecuba]: "Hecuba / Odysseus dragged unto his ship. The tears / Poured from her eyes as water from a spring; / Trembled her limbs, fear-frenzied was her heart; / Rent were her hoary tresses and besprent / With ashes of the hearth, cast by her hands / When she saw Priam slain and Troy aflame" (Posthomerica 14.10058-10064, trans. A.S. Way)
