## Overview

**Castor** and **Polydeuces** (the Dioscuri, "Sons of Zeus") were twin brothers born to Leda, though the sources consistently distinguish their paternity: Polydeuces was the son of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md), while Castor was the mortal son of Tyndareus. Castor was renowned as a tamer of horses and Polydeuces as a boxer. They rescued their sister [Helen](helen.md) after [Theseus](theseus.md) abducted her, sailed with the Argonauts, and fought Idas and Lynceus over stolen cattle (or brides). When Castor was killed, Polydeuces refused full immortality and chose instead to share his divine portion, spending alternate days in heaven and under the earth.

## In the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md)

### Helen's Missing Brothers (Book III)

[Helen](helen.md), watching the Greek army from Troy's walls, looks for her brothers among the host: "two captains of the host can I not see, even Kastor tamer of horses and Polydeukes the skilful boxer, mine own brethren, whom the same mother bare." She wonders whether they stayed behind "for fear of the many scornings and revilings that are mine."[^il-helen]

The narrator reveals the truth: "them the life-giving earth held fast there in Lakedaimon, in their dear native land."[^il-dead]

[^il-helen]: "two captains of the host can I not see, even Kastor tamer of horses and Polydeukes the skilful boxer, mine own brethren, whom the same mother bare. Either they came not in the company from lovely Lakedaimon... for fear of the many scornings and revilings that are mine" (Iliad 3.236-242, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il-dead]: "them the life-giving earth held fast there in Lakedaimon, in their dear native land" (Iliad 3.243-244)

## In the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md)

### Catalogue of Heroines (Book XI)

Odysseus sees Leda in the underworld, "the famous bed-fellow of Tyndareus, who bare to Tyndareus two sons, hardy of heart, Castor tamer of steeds, and Polydeuces the boxer." Their unique fate is described: "These twain yet live, but the quickening earth is over them; and even in the nether world they have honour at the hand of Zeus. And they possess their life in turn, living one day and dying the next, and they have gotten worship even as the gods."[^od-twins]

[^od-twins]: "Castor tamer of steeds, and Polydeuces the boxer. These twain yet live, but the quickening earth is over them; and even in the nether world they have honour at the hand of Zeus. And they possess their life in turn, living one day and dying the next, and they have gotten worship even as the gods" (Odyssey 11.298-304, trans. Butcher and Lang)

## In the Catalogue of Women

Hesiod "makes them both sons of Zeus," departing from the usual tradition that only Polydeuces was Zeus's son.[^cat-sons] A Cypria fragment distinguishes them: "Castor was mortal, and the fate of death was destined for him; but Polydeuces, scion of Ares, was immortal."[^cypria-mortal]

In the story of Helen's suitors, Castor and Polydeuces appear as [Helen](helen.md)'s brothers, present when the suitors gathered. Menelaus "was ever sending messages to horse-taming Castor and prize-winning Polydeuces."[^cat-suitors]

[^cat-sons]: "Hesiod in giving their descent makes them both sons of Zeus" (Catalogue of Women, Fragment 66, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^cypria-mortal]: "Castor was mortal, and the fate of death was destined for him; but Polydeuces, scion of Ares, was immortal" (Cypria, Fragment 7, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^cat-suitors]: "was ever sending messages to horse-taming Castor and prize-winning Polydeuces" (Catalogue of Women, Fragment 68)

## In the Homeric Hymns

### Hymn XVII (To the Dioscuri)

"Sing, clear-voiced Muse, of Castor and Polydeuces, the Tyndaridae, who sprang from Olympian Zeus. Beneath the heights of Taygetus stately Leda bare them, when the dark-clouded Son of Cronos had privily bent her to his will."[^hymn17]

### Hymn XXXIII (To the Dioscuri)

The longer hymn celebrates them as "delivers of men on earth and of swift-going ships when stormy gales rage over the ruthless sea."[^hymn33]

[^hymn17]: "Sing, clear-voiced Muse, of Castor and Polydeuces, the Tyndaridae, who sprang from Olympian Zeus. Beneath the heights of Taygetus stately Leda bare them" (Homeric Hymn XVII, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^hymn33]: "children who are delivers of men on earth and of swift-going ships when stormy gales rage over the ruthless sea" (Homeric Hymn XXXIII)

## In the [Epic Cycle](../sources/epic-cycle.md)

### Cattle Raid and Death (Cypria)

"Castor and Polydeuces, while stealing the cattle of Idas and Lynceus, were caught in the act, and Castor was killed by Idas, and Lynceus and Idas by Polydeuces. Zeus gave them immortality every other day."[^cypria-death]

An earlier fragment provides detail: "Lynceus, trusting in his swift feet, made for Taygetus. He climbed its highest peak and looked throughout the whole isle of Pelops... and soon the glorious hero with his dread eyes saw horse-taming Castor and athlete Polydeuces both hidden within a hollow oak." Another fragment adds that "Castor was killed with a spear shot by Idas the son of Aphareus."[^cypria-oak]

### Rescue of Helen (Cypria)

Before the Trojan War, when [Theseus](theseus.md) had abducted the young [Helen](helen.md), the Dioscuri rescued her: "Castor was wounded in the right thigh by Aphidnus who was king at that time. Then the Dioscuri, failing to find Theseus, sacked Athens."[^cypria-rescue]

[^cypria-death]: "Castor and Polydeuces, while stealing the cattle of Idas and Lynceus, were caught in the act, and Castor was killed by Idas, and Lynceus and Idas by Polydeuces. Zeus gave them immortality every other day" (Cypria, summary by Proclus, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^cypria-oak]: "soon the glorious hero with his dread eyes saw horse-taming Castor and athlete Polydeuces both hidden within a hollow oak" (Cypria, Fragment 12); "Castor was killed with a spear shot by Idas the son of Aphareus" (Cypria, Fragment per Philodemus)

## In the [Argonautica](../sources/argonautica.md)

### Polydeuces vs. Amycus

At the land of the Bebrycians, king Amycus demanded that whoever came to his shores box with him — a custom by which he killed all visitors. He is compared to the giant [Typhoeus](../creatures/typhoeus.md) in size and ferocity. Polydeuces accepted the challenge. He is described as radiant in contrast: "the bloom of the first down still on his cheeks," likened to a star.[^arg-dioscuri-amycus] The fight was brutal; Polydeuces was the more skilled and eventually killed Amycus with a blow to the temple. Castor aided in dispersing the Bebrycians who attacked after their king fell.[^arg-dioscuri-castor]

The heroes celebrated Polydeuces with his epithet: "Therapnaean son of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md)."[^arg-dioscuri-epithet]

### The Dodonian Oak and the Bull Trial

The Dodonian beam (a plank from the speaking oak of Zeus set in the Argo's keel) directed the heroes to pray for a safe path to [Circe](../deities/circe.md).[^arg-dioscuri-oak] During Jason's trial with the brazen bulls at Colchis, Castor and Polydeuces helped steady the yoke.[^arg-dioscuri-yoke]

## In the [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md)

### Parentage (3.10.7)

"Zeus in the form of a swan consorted with Leda, and on the same night Tyndareus cohabited with her; and she bore Pollux and Helen to Zeus, and Castor and Clytaemnestra to Tyndareus."[^apd-birth]

### Skills and Marriage (3.11.2)

"Of the sons born to Leda Castor practised the art of war, and Pollux the art of boxing; and on account of their manliness they were both called Dioscuri." They carried off the daughters of Leucippus from Messene: "Pollux had Mnesileus by Phoebe, and Castor had Anogon by Hilaira."[^apd-skills]

### The Cattle Raid and Death (3.11.2)

The Dioscuri drove cattle from Arcadia together with Idas and Lynceus, and Idas was allowed to divide the spoil. He cut a cow in four and claimed the entire haul by eating fastest. The Dioscuri "marched against Messene, and drove away that cattle and much else besides." The conflict escalated: "Lynceus spied Castor and discovered him to Idas, who killed him. Pollux chased them and slew Lynceus by throwing his spear, but in pursuing Lynceus he was wounded in the head with a stone thrown by him, and fell down in a swoon. And Zeus smote Idas with a thunderbolt."[^apd-raid]

"Pollux he carried up to heaven. Nevertheless, as Pollux refused to accept immortality while his brother Castor was dead, Zeus permitted them both to be every other day among the gods and among mortals."[^apd-immortality]

### Rescue of Helen (E.1.23)

"The Dioscuri, with the Lacedaemonians and Arcadians, captured Athens and carried away Helen, and with her Aethra, daughter of Pittheus, into captivity." They also "brought back Menestheus from exile, and gave him the sovereignty of Athens."[^apd-helen]

### Other Exploits

Castor taught [Heracles](heracles.md) to fence.[^apd-heracles] Both brothers sailed with the Argonauts.[^apd-argo] With Jason and the Dioscuri, [Peleus](peleus.md) "laid waste Iolcus."[^apd-iolcus]

[^apd-birth]: "Zeus in the form of a swan consorted with Leda, and on the same night Tyndareus cohabited with her; and she bore Pollux and Helen to Zeus, and Castor and Clytaemnestra to Tyndareus" (Bibliotheca 3.10.7, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-skills]: "Castor practised the art of war, and Pollux the art of boxing; and on account of their manliness they were both called Dioscuri... Pollux had Mnesileus by Phoebe, and Castor had Anogon by Hilaira" (Bibliotheca 3.11.2)

## In the [Fabulae](../sources/hyginus.md)

### Parentage (§77)

"Jupiter, changed into a swan, had intercourse with Leda near the river Eurotas, and from that embrace she bore Pollux and Helen; to Tyndareus she bore Castor and Clytemnestra."[^hyg-birth]

### The Brides and Death of Castor (§80)

"Idas and Lynceus, sons of Aphareus from Messene, had as promised brides Phoebe and Hilaira, daughters of Leucippus. Since these were most beautiful maidens — Phoebe being a priestess of Minerva, and Hilaira of Diana — Castor and Pollux, inflamed with love, carried them off."[^hyg-brides]

In the ensuing fight, "Castor killed Lynceus in battle; Idas, at his brother's death, forgot both strife and bride, and started to bury his brother. When he was placing the bones in a funeral monument, Castor intervened, and tried to prevent his raising the monument, because he had won over him as if he were a woman. In anger, Idas pierced the thigh of Castor with the sword he wore." An alternative: "as he was building the monument he pushed it on Castor and thus killed him."[^hyg-castor-death]

Polydeuces "overcame Idas in a single fight, recovered the body of his brother, and buried it." Since Zeus had given Polydeuces a star but not Castor, "Pollux begged that he be allowed to share his honor with his brother. This was granted him."[^hyg-share]

### Rescue of Helen (§79)

After [Theseus](theseus.md) and Pirithous carried off Helen, "Castor and Pollux, Helen's brothers, fought for her sake, and took Aethra, Theseus' mother, and Phisadie, Pirithous' sister, and gave them in servitude to their sister."[^hyg-rescue]

### Argonaut Voyage (§14, §17)

Both brothers sailed with the Argonauts. Pollux killed Amycus, king of Bebrycia, who "compelled whoever came to his kingdom to contend with him in boxing, and slew the vanquished. When he had challenged the Argonauts to a boxing match, Pollux fought with him and killed him."[^hyg-amycus]

### Calydonian Boar (§173)

Both brothers are listed among the heroes who hunted the Calydonian Boar.[^hyg-boar]

[^hyg-birth]: "Jupiter, changed into a swan, had intercourse with Leda near the river Eurotas, and from that embrace she bore Pollux and Helen; to Tyndareus she bore Castor and Clytemnestra" (Fabulae §77, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-brides]: "Idas and Lynceus, sons of Aphareus from Messene, had as promised brides Phoebe and Hilaira, daughters of Leucippus. Since these were most beautiful maidens — Phoebe being a priestess of Minerva, and Hilaira of Diana — Castor and Pollux, inflamed with love, carried them off" (Fabulae §80)
[^hyg-castor-death]: "Castor killed Lynceus in battle; Idas, at his brother's death, forgot both strife and bride, and started to bury his brother... In anger, Idas pierced the thigh of Castor with the sword he wore. Others say that as he was building the monument he pushed it on Castor and thus killed him" (Fabulae §80)
[^hyg-share]: "Pollux begged that he be allowed to share his honor with his brother. This was granted him" (Fabulae §80)
[^hyg-rescue]: "Castor and Pollux, Helen's brothers, fought for her sake, and took Aethra, Theseus' mother, and Phisadie, Pirithous' sister, and gave them in servitude to their sister" (Fabulae §79)
[^hyg-amycus]: "Amycus, son of Neptune and Melie, king of Bebrycia, compelled whoever came to his kingdom to contend with him in boxing, and slew the vanquished. When he had challenged the Argonauts to a boxing match, Pollux fought with him and killed him" (Fabulae §17)
[^hyg-boar]: "Castor and Pollux, sons of Zeus and Leda, from Lacedaemon" among the Calydonian Boar hunters (Bibliotheca 1.8.2)

## In [Pindar](../sources/pindar.md)

### Guardians of Sparta (Nemean X)

Pindar celebrates the Dioscuri as patrons of athletes and "guardians of the wide plains of Sparta with Hermes and Herakles," who "mete out fair hap in games, and to righteous men they have great regard."[^pin-guardians]

### Death and Shared Fate (Nemean X)

Pindar gives the fullest poetic account of Castor's death and Polydeuces's choice. The twins dwelt "one day with their dear father Zeus, and the next in the secret places under the earth, within the valleys of Therapnai, fulfilling equal fate: because on this wise chose Polydeukes to live his life rather than to be altogether god and abide continually in heaven, when that Kastor had fallen in the fight."[^pin-fate]

Idas, "wroth for his oxen," smote Castor "with a bronze spearhead." Lynkeus had spotted them from Taÿgetos, "for he of all men walking the earth had keenest eyes."[^pin-lynkeus] The sons of Aphareus tried to fight Polydeuces near their father's tomb: "Thence wrenched they a carved headstone that was set to glorify the dead, and they hurled it at the breast of Polydeukes. But they crushed him not, neither made him give back, but rushing onward with fierce spear he drave the bronze head into Lynkeus' side. And against Idas Zeus hurled a thunderbolt of consuming fire."[^pin-battle]

Polydeuces returned to find Castor dying — "not quite dead, but the death-gasp rattled in his throat." He wept and cried to Zeus: "Father Kronion — ah! what shall make an end of woes? Bid me, me also, O king, to die with him. The glory is departed from a man bereaved of friends. Few are they who in a time of trouble are faithful in companionship of toil."[^pin-lament]

Zeus appeared and offered a choice: "Thou art my son: but thy brother afterward was by mortal seed begotten in thy mother of the hero that was her husband." He could dwell in Olympus forever "with Athene and with Ares of the shadowing spear," or share Castor's fate — "half thy time thou shalt be alive beneath the earth, and half in the golden house of heaven."[^pin-choice]

"Polydeukes doubted not which counsel he should choose. So Zeus unsealed the eye, and presently the tongue also, of Kastor of the brazen mail."[^pin-restore]

### Brief Mentions

In Pythian V, Kastor is invoked as patron of charioteers: "Kastor of the golden car, who after the wintry storm hath shed bright calm about thy happy hearth."[^pin-pyth5] In Olympian III, the ode celebrates the feast of the Theoxenia, given in the name of the Dioscuri, called "hospitable" because the Emmenidai clan "beyond all mortals they do honour to them with tables of hospitality."[^pin-ol3] In Isthmian I, they are called "the mightiest charioteers."[^pin-ist1] In a Fragment (Dirge), the Dioscuri receive worship "by the streams of Eurotas."[^pin-frag]

## Variant Traditions

### Parentage

Most sources agree that Polydeuces was Zeus's son and Castor was Tyndareus's, but Hesiod "makes them both sons of Zeus" (Catalogue of Women, Fragment 66).

### The Cattle Raid

Pindar and Apollodorus agree that the quarrel with Idas and Lynceus was over stolen cattle. But Hyginus makes the conflict about brides — the Leucippides Phoebe and Hilaira, already promised to Idas and Lynceus.

### How Castor Died

- **Pindar** (Nemean X) and **Apollodorus** (3.11.2): Idas killed Castor with a spear (or spearhead).
- **Hyginus** (§80): Idas pierced Castor's thigh with a sword while Castor tried to prevent him from building Lynceus's tomb; alternatively, Idas pushed the tombstone onto Castor.
- **Cypria**: "Castor was killed with a spear shot by Idas."

### Polydeuces's Vengeance

Pindar says Polydeuces killed Lynkeus with a spear and Zeus struck Idas with a thunderbolt. Apollodorus agrees. But Hyginus says Polydeuces "overcame Idas in a single fight" with no mention of Zeus's thunderbolt.
