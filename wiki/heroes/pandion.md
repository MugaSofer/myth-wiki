### Overview

**Pandion I** was king of Athens, son of [Erichthonius](erichthonius.md). He ruled during the time when [Demeter](../deities/demeter.md) and [Dionysus](../deities/dionysus.md) first came to Attica. He allied with Tereus of Thrace to win a border war, giving him his daughter Procne as a reward — a gift that led to catastrophe for his daughters.

#### Reign and the Coming of the Gods (3.14.7)

Pandion I became king after [Erichthonius](erichthonius.md) died and was buried in Athena's precinct. "In his time Demeter and Dionysus came to Attica."[^apd-pan1-gods] [Demeter](../deities/demeter.md) was welcomed by Celeus at Eleusis; [Dionysus](../deities/dionysus.md) was welcomed by Icarius, who learned from him the making of wine. Icarius brought wine to shepherds, who drank it and, imagining they had been bewitched, killed him. His daughter Erigone found his body through her dog Maera and hanged herself in grief.[^apd-pan1-icarius]

#### Family and the Alliance with Tereus (3.14.8)

Pandion married Zeuxippe, his mother's sister, and had twin sons, Erechtheus and Butes, and daughters Procne and Philomela.[^apd-pan1-family]

War broke out with Labdacus over a boundary dispute. Pandion called in Tereus, son of [Ares](../deities/ares.md), from Thrace to help. "Having with his help brought the war to a successful close, he gave Tereus his own daughter Procne in marriage."[^apd-pan1-tereus]

Tereus fathered Itys by Procne, then fell in love with Philomela. He told Procne that Procne was dead, concealed her, married Philomela, bedded with her, and cut out her tongue. Philomela wove a message in a robe to reveal her plight to Procne. Procne found her sister, killed Itys, and served his flesh to Tereus. When Tereus discovered what had happened, he pursued the sisters with an axe. All three were transformed into birds: Procne became a nightingale, Philomela a swallow, and Tereus a hoopoe.[^apd-pan1-tragedy]

(For Tereus's full story as told in the Metamorphoses, see [Tereus](tereus.md).)

## Pandion II

| | |
|---|---|
| **Parentage** | Son of Cecrops II (son of [Erechtheus](erechtheus.md)) and Metiadusa |
| **Consort** | Pylia (daughter of Pylas of Megara) |
| **Children** | Aegeus, Pallas, Nisus, Lycus |
| **Homeland** | Athens (expelled to Megara) |
| **Known for** | Expelled from Athens by the sons of Metion; made king of Megara; his sons recaptured Athens after his death |
| **First appearance** | [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) 3.15.5 |

### Overview

**Pandion II** was king of Athens and Megara, son of Cecrops II and grandson of [Erechtheus](erechtheus.md). He was expelled from Athens by the sons of Metion but later became king of Megara. His sons — Aegeus, Pallas, Nisus, and Lycus — recaptured Athens after his death. Aegeus went on to become the father of [Theseus](theseus.md).

### In the [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md)

#### Expulsion and Megara (3.15.5)

After Cecrops II became king (following the destruction of [Erechtheus](erechtheus.md) by [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md)), Cecrops II married Metiadusa and fathered Pandion II. "This Pandion, reigning after Cecrops, was expelled by the sons of Metion in a sedition."[^apd-pan2-expelled] He went to Megara and married Pylia, daughter of Pylas. In time he was even appointed king of that city: Pylas slew his father's brother Bias and gave the kingdom to Pandion, while Pylas himself led a body of settlers to the Peloponnese and founded the city of Pylus.[^apd-pan2-megara]

#### Sons (3.15.5–3.15.6)

While at Megara, Pandion II fathered Aegeus, Pallas, Nisus, and Lycus. Apollodorus notes a variant: "some say that Aegeus was a son of Scyrius, but was passed off by Pandion as his own."[^apd-pan2-sons]

#### Aftermath (3.15.6)

"After the death of Pandion his sons marched against Athens, expelled the Metionids, and divided the government in four; but Aegeus had the whole power."[^apd-pan2-aftermath] Aegeus's subsequent story — including his marriage to Aethra, the sword and sandals left under a rock, and the oracle concerning his children — leads to the birth of [Theseus](theseus.md).

And having sought out her sister, Procne killed her son Itys, boiled him, served him up for supper to the unwitting Tereus, and fled with her sister in haste. When Tereus was aware of what had happened, he snatched up an axe and pursued them. And being overtaken at Daulia in Phocis, they prayed the gods to be turned into birds, and Procne became a nightingale, and Philomela a swallow.
