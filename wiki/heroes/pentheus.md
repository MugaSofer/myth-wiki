## Overview

**Pentheus** was king of [Thebes](../places/thebes.md), grandson of [Cadmus](cadmus.md) through his mother Agave. He opposed the worship of [Dionysus](../deities/dionysus.md) and was torn apart by his own mother and aunts in Bacchic frenzy — the archetypal punishment for refusing to accept the god.

## In the Bibliotheca (3.5.2)

Pentheus succeeded [Cadmus](cadmus.md) as king of Thebes. When Dionysus forced the Theban women to "rave in Bacchic frenzy on Cithaeron," Pentheus tried to stop them and went to the mountain to spy. "Coming to Cithaeron to spy on the Bacchanals, he was torn limb from limb by his mother Agave in a fit of madness; for she thought he was a wild beast."[^apd-pentheus]

[^apd-pentheus]: "coming to Cithaeron to spy on the Bacchanals, he was torn limb from limb by his mother Agave in a fit of madness; for she thought he was a wild beast" (Bibliotheca 3.5.2, trans. J.G. Frazer)

## In the Metamorphoses (3.509-733)

[Tiresias](tiresias.md) warned Pentheus: "Oh glad the day to thee, if, light denied, thine eyes, most fortunate, should not behold the Bacchanalian rites!" He prophesied Pentheus would be torn apart, but Pentheus drove the seer away.[^met-warning]

Pentheus scorned Dionysus as "an unarmed boy... whose ringlets reek with myrrh" and ordered his followers seized. When brought the captive follower Acoetes, who told of miracles, Pentheus remained unmoved. He went to spy on the rites on Cithaeron, where his mother Agave, "first of all the frenzied rout," mistook him for a boar. Pentheus pleaded: "Mother! Look upon me! I am your own; your boy Actaeon!" But the maddened women tore him apart.[^met-death]

## In Euripides' Bacchae

The [Bacchae](../sources/euripides-bacchae.md) gives the fullest treatment of Pentheus's story.

### Defiance of Dionysus

Pentheus returns to find Thebes in upheaval. He denounces the Bacchic rites as cover for debauchery: "the women have left our palace in mad-wandering Bacchic rites; and that they are rushing about in the shady mountains... and that they consider Venus before Bacchus."[^eur-bac-denounce] He orders the disguised stranger hunted down, threatening to "stop him from making a noise with the thyrsus, and waving his hair, by cutting off his neck from his body."[^eur-bac-threat]

He is outraged to find his grandfather [Cadmus](cadmus.md) and [Tiresias](tiresias.md) dressed for Bacchic worship: "I see Tiresias the soothsayer, in dappled deer-skins, and the father of my mother, most great absurdity, raging about with a thyrsus."[^eur-bac-outrage] He ignores Tiresias's theological defense and Cadmus's pragmatic counsel.

### Interrogation and Imprisonment

When the disguised Dionysus is brought before him, Pentheus focuses on the stranger's effeminate appearance and tries to intimidate him. Dionysus answers calmly. Pentheus imprisons him, but Dionysus escapes supernaturally while the palace shakes.

### Madness and Cross-Dressing

Dionysus persuades Pentheus to spy on the Bacchants disguised in women's clothes. As Pentheus emerges in Bacchic dress, he is already half-mad: "I think I see two suns, and twin Thebes, and seven-gated city; and you seem to guide me, being like a bull."[^eur-bac-mad] He believes he could carry Mount Cithaeron on his shoulders.[^eur-bac-strength]

Dionysus adjusts his costume with sinister double-meanings, telling Pentheus "You are terrible, terrible: and you go to terrible sufferings; so that you shall find a renown reaching to heaven."[^eur-bac-terrible]

### Death

On Cithaeron, Dionysus seats Pentheus atop a pine tree bent to the earth by divine strength, then from the sky commands the Maenads to attack. Agave leads the assault. Pentheus throws off his disguise and pleads: "I, indeed, O mother, am thy child, Pentheus, whom you bore in the house of Echion; but pity me, O mother! and do not slay me, thy child, for my sins."[^eur-bac-plea] But Agave, "possessed by Bacchus," tears off his shoulder; Ino and Autonoe complete the dismemberment. Agave fixes his head on a thyrsus and carries it back to Thebes, believing it a lion's head.[^eur-bac-dismember]

### Pentheus's Name

Dionysus makes a wordplay on Pentheus's name, which echoes the Greek word for grief (penthos): "You are suited to be miserable according to your name."[^eur-bac-name]

[^eur-bac-denounce]: "the women have left our palace in mad-wandering Bacchic rites; and that they are rushing about in the shady mountains, honoring with dances this new God Bacchus, whoever he is" (Bacchae 215-218, trans. T.A. Buckley)
[^eur-bac-threat]: "if I catch him under this roof, I will stop him from making a noise with the thyrsus, and waving his hair, by cutting off his neck from his body" (Bacchae 239-241, trans. T.A. Buckley)
[^eur-bac-outrage]: "I see Tiresias the soothsayer, in dappled deer-skins, and the father of my mother, most great absurdity, raging about with a thyrsus" (Bacchae 248-250, trans. T.A. Buckley)
[^eur-bac-mad]: "I think I see two suns, and twin Thebes, and seven-gated city; and you seem to guide me, being like a bull, and horns seem to grow on your head" (Bacchae 918-921, trans. T.A. Buckley)
[^eur-bac-strength]: "Could I bear on my shoulders the glens of Cithæron, Bacchæ and all?" (Bacchae 945, trans. T.A. Buckley)
[^eur-bac-terrible]: "You are terrible, terrible: and you go to terrible sufferings; so that you shall find a renown reaching to heaven" (Bacchae 971-972, trans. T.A. Buckley)
[^eur-bac-plea]: "I, indeed, O mother, am thy child, Pentheus, whom you bore in the house of Echion; but pity me, O mother! and do not slay me, thy child, for my sins" (Bacchae 1118-1121, trans. T.A. Buckley)
[^eur-bac-dismember]: "seizing his left hand with her hand, treading on the side of the unhappy man, she tore off his shoulder, not by her own strength, but the God gave facility to her hands; and Ino completed the work on the other side, tearing his flesh" (Bacchae 1125-1130, trans. T.A. Buckley)
[^eur-bac-name]: "You are suited to be miserable according to your name" (Bacchae 508, trans. T.A. Buckley)
