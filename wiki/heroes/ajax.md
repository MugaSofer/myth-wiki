# Ajax (Telamonian)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Also known as** | Ajax son of Telamon, Great Ajax |
| **Parents** | Telamon and Periboea (or Eriboea) |
| **Half-brother** | Teucer (by Hesione) |
| **First appearance** | [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) II |

## Overview

**Ajax**, son of Telamon, is the greatest Greek warrior after [Achilles](achilles.md). He is distinguished by his enormous size, his great shield, and his unwavering courage — but his story ends in madness and suicide when the arms of Achilles are awarded to [Odysseus](odysseus.md) instead of him.

## In the Bibliotheca

### Birth (3.12.7)

Telamon settled in Salamis and married Periboea. Ajax was named after an eagle: "when [Heracles](heracles.md) had prayed that he might have a male child, an eagle appeared after the prayer."[^apd-birth] (The Greek word for eagle, *aietos*, was linked to *Aias*.)

Telamon also had a son Teucer by Hesione, daughter of Laomedon, whom he received as a prize when he accompanied Heracles against [Troy](../places/troy.md).

### The Trojan War (E.3.11-E.5.7)

Ajax brought twelve ships from Salamis.[^apd-ships] In the fighting, he was a dominant figure:

- When [Hector](../sources/apollodorus.md) "challenged the bravest to single combat, many came forward, but the lot fell on Ajax, and he did doughty deeds; but night coming on, the heralds parted them."[^apd-duel]
- "Ajax having retreated, he [Hector] set fire to the ships."[^apd-retreat]
- After [Patroclus](patroclus.md) fell, "Ajax with difficulty, by performing feats of valor, rescued the body," while [Odysseus](odysseus.md) fought the assailants.[^apd-rescue]
- At Achilles' death, "Ajax killed Glaucus, and gave the arms to be conveyed to the ships, but the body he carried, in a shower of darts, through the midst of the enemy."[^apd-achilles-body]

### Madness and Death (E.5.6-7)

After Achilles' death, "his arms were offered as a prize to the bravest, and Ajax and Ulysses came forward as competitors. The judges were the Trojans or, according to some, the allies, and Ulysses was preferred."[^apd-judgment]

"Disordered by chagrin, Ajax planned a nocturnal attack on the army. And [Athena](../deities/athena.md) drove him mad, and turned him, sword in hand, among the cattle, and in his frenzy he slaughtered the cattle with the herdsmen, taking them for the Achaeans."[^apd-madness]

"Afterwards he came to his senses and slew also himself. And Agamemnon forbade his body to be burnt; and he alone of all who fell at Ilium is buried, in a coffin. His grave is at Rhoeteum."[^apd-death]
