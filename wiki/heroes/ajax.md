## Overview

**Ajax**, son of Telamon, is the greatest Greek warrior after [Achilles](achilles.md). He is distinguished by his enormous size, his great shield, and his unwavering courage — but his story ends in madness and suicide when the arms of Achilles are awarded to [Odysseus](odysseus.md) instead of him.

## In the Bibliotheca

### Birth (3.12.7)

Telamon settled in Salamis and married Periboea. Ajax was named after an eagle: "when [Heracles](heracles.md) had prayed that he might have a male child, an eagle appeared after the prayer."[^apd-birth] (The Greek word for eagle, *aietos*, was linked to *Aias*.) The Great Eoiae preserves the same tradition: "Heracles entertained by Telamon, standing dressed in his lion-skin and praying, and there also we find the eagle sent by Zeus, from which Aias took his name."[^ge-eagle]

[^ge-eagle]: "Heracles entertained by Telamon, standing dressed in his lion-skin and praying, and there also we find the eagle sent by Zeus, from which Aias took his name" (Great Eoiae, Fragment 3, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

Telamon also had a son Teucer by Hesione, daughter of Laomedon, whom he received as a prize when he accompanied Heracles against [Troy](../places/troy.md).

### The Trojan War (E.3.11-E.5.7)

Ajax brought twelve ships from Salamis.[^apd-ships] In the fighting, he was a dominant figure:

- When [Hector](../sources/apollodorus.md) "challenged the bravest to single combat, many came forward, but the lot fell on Ajax, and he did doughty deeds; but night coming on, the heralds parted them."[^apd-duel]
- "Ajax having retreated, he [Hector] set fire to the ships."[^apd-retreat]
- After [Patroclus](patroclus.md) fell, "Ajax with difficulty, by performing feats of valor, rescued the body," while [Odysseus](odysseus.md) fought the assailants.[^apd-rescue]
- At Achilles' death, "Ajax killed Glaucus, and gave the arms to be conveyed to the ships, but the body he carried, in a shower of darts, through the midst of the enemy."[^apd-achilles-body]

### Madness and Death (E.5.6-7)

After Achilles' death, "his arms were offered as a prize to the bravest, and Ajax and Ulysses came forward as competitors. The judges were the Trojans or, according to some, the allies, and Ulysses was preferred."[^apd-judgment]

"Disordered by chagrin, Ajax planned a nocturnal attack on the army. And [Athena](../deities/athena.md) drove him mad, and turned him, sword in hand, among the cattle, and in his frenzy he slaughtered the cattle with the herdsmen, taking them for the Achaeans."[^apd-madness]

"Afterwards he came to his senses and slew also himself. And Agamemnon forbade his body to be burnt; and he alone of all who fell at Ilium is buried, in a coffin. His grave is at Rhoeteum."[^apd-death]

## In the Fabulae

### The Contest of Arms (§107)

The [Fabulae](../sources/hyginus.md) gives a terse account of the contest that ended Ajax's life. After [Achilles](achilles.md) was killed, "Telamonian Ajax demanded from the Danaans the arms of [Achilles](achilles.md), on the grounds that he was cousin on his father's side."[^hyg-demand] The claim was based on kinship: Telamon and Peleus were brothers, making Ajax and Achilles cousins.

But the judgment went against him: "Through the anger of Minerva they were denied him by Agamemnon and Menelaus, and given to Ulysses."[^hyg-denial] The Fabulae attributes [Athena](../deities/athena.md)'s hostility as the decisive factor in the outcome.

The result was tragic: "Ajax, harbouring rage, in madness slaughtered his flocks, and killed himself with that sword he had received from Hector as a gift when the two met in battle line."[^hyg-suicide] The reference to Hector's sword recalls their famous duel, where the two heroes exchanged gifts after fighting to a draw.

[^hyg-demand]: "After Hector's burial, when Achilles was wandering along the ramparts of the Trojans and saying that he alone had reduced Troy, Apollo in anger, taking the form of Alexander Paris, struck him with an arrows on the heel which was said to be vulnerable, and killed him. When Achilles was killed and given burial, Telamonian Ajax demanded from the Danaans the arms of Achilles, on the grounds that he was cousin on his father's side" (Fabulae §107, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-denial]: "Through the anger of Minerva they were denied him by Agamemnon and Menelaus, and given to Ulysses" (Fabulae §107, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-suicide]: "Ajax, harbouring rage, in madness slaughtered his flocks, and killed himself with that sword he had received from Hector as a gift when the two met in battle line" (Fabulae §107, trans. Mary Grant)
