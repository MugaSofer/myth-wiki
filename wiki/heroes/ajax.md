# Ajax (Telamonian)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Also known as** | Ajax son of Telamon, Great Ajax |
| **Parents** | Telamon and Periboea (or Eriboea) |
| **Half-brother** | Teucer (by Hesione) |
| **First appearance** | [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) II |

## Overview

**Ajax**, son of Telamon, is the greatest Greek warrior after [Achilles](achilles.md). He is distinguished by his enormous size, his great shield, and his unwavering courage — but his story ends in madness and suicide when the arms of Achilles are awarded to [Odysseus](odysseus.md) instead of him.

## Epithets

- **"bulwark of the Achaians"** — used repeatedly in the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md)[^il7-bulwark]
- **"Aias of the seed of Zeus, son of Telamon, chieftain of the host"** — [Hector](hector.md)'s address to him before their duel[^il7-seed]

[^il7-bulwark]: "So rose up huge Aias, bulwark of the Achaians, with a smile on his grim face" (Iliad 7.213, passim, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il7-seed]: "Aias of the seed of Zeus, son of Telamon, chieftain of the host, tempt not thou me like some puny boy or woman" (Iliad 7.233-235)

## Appearance

The [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) emphasises Ajax's immense physical presence. When he rises to fight [Hector](hector.md), he goes "with long strides of his feet beneath him" and the Trojans tremble at the sight of him, while "Hector's own heart beat within his breast."[^il7-stride]

When defending the ships, he strides across the decks leaping from ship to ship: "even as a man right well skilled in horsemanship that couples four horses out of many... firmly ever he leaps, and changes his stand from horse to horse, while they fly along, even so Aias went with long strides, over many a deck of the swift ships, and his voice went up unto heaven."[^il15-leap]

[^il7-stride]: "Aias came near bearing his tower-like shield of bronze... And he went with long strides of his feet beneath him, shaking his far-shadowing spear. Then moreover the Argives rejoiced to look upon him, but sore trembling came upon the Trojans" (Iliad 7.213-217)
[^il15-leap]: "even as a man right well skilled in horsemanship that couples four horses out of many... firmly ever he leaps, and changes his stand from horse to horse, while they fly along, even so Aias went with long strides, over many a deck of the swift ships, and his voice went up unto heaven" (Iliad 15.678-684)

## Equipment

### The Sevenfold Shield

Ajax's most distinctive piece of equipment is his "tower-like shield of bronze, with sevenfold ox-hide, that Tychios had wrought him cunningly; Tychios far best of curriers, that had his home in Hyle, who made him his glancing shield, of sevenfold hides of stalwart bulls, and overlaid the seven with bronze."[^il7-shield] In their duel, Hector's spear "through six folds went the stubborn bronze cleaving, but in the seventh hide it stayed."[^il7-six]

### The Sea-Pike

When defending the ships against the Trojans' assault, Ajax "wielded in his hands a great pike for sea-battles, jointed with rings, two and twenty cubits in length."[^il15-pike]

[^il7-shield]: "Aias came near bearing his tower-like shield of bronze, with sevenfold ox-hide, that Tychios had wrought him cunningly; Tychios far best of curriers, that had his home in Hyle, who made him his glancing shield, of sevenfold hides of stalwart bulls, and overlaid the seven with bronze" (Iliad 7.219-224)
[^il7-six]: "Through six folds went the stubborn bronze cleaving, but in the seventh hide it stayed" (Iliad 7.246-247)
[^il15-pike]: "he wielded in his hands a great pike for sea-battles, jointed with rings, two and twenty cubits in length" (Iliad 15.676-678)

## In the Iliad

### Idomeneus's Assessment (Book XIII)

[Idomeneus](../sources/iliad.md) praises Ajax as without equal in close combat, rating him above even [Achilles](achilles.md) in that respect: "not to a man would he yield, the great Telamonian Aias, to a man that is mortal and eateth Demeter's grain, and may be cloven with the sword of bronze, and with hurling of great stones. Nay, not even to Achilles the breaker of the ranks of men would he give way, not in close fight; but for speed of foot none may in any wise strive with Achilles."[^il13-idomeneus]

### Felling Hector with a Stone (Book XIV)

After Hector's spear failed to pierce Ajax's double belt, "the great Telamonian Aias smote him with a huge stone; for many stones, the props of swift ships, were rolled among the feet of the fighters; one of these he lifted, and smote Hector on the breast, over the shield-rim, near the neck, and made him spin like a top with the blow, that he reeled round and round." Hector fell "even as when an oak falls uprooted beneath the stroke of father Zeus," and had to be carried from the field by his comrades.[^il14-stone]

[^il13-idomeneus]: "not to a man would he yield, the great Telamonian Aias, to a man that is mortal and eateth Demeter's grain, and may be cloven with the sword of bronze, and with hurling of great stones. Nay, not even to Achilles the breaker of the ranks of men would he give way, not in close fight; but for speed of foot none may in any wise strive with Achilles" (Iliad 13.327-331, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il14-stone]: "the great Telamonian Aias smote him with a huge stone; for many stones, the props of swift ships, were rolled among the feet of the fighters; one of these he lifted, and smote Hector on the breast, over the shield-rim, near the neck, and made him spin like a top with the blow, that he reeled round and round. And even as when an oak falls uprooted beneath the stroke of father Zeus... even so fell mighty Hector straightway in the dust" (Iliad 14.407-418)

## In the Bibliotheca

### Birth (3.12.7)

Telamon settled in Salamis and married Periboea. Ajax was named after an eagle: "when [Heracles](heracles.md) had prayed that he might have a male child, an eagle appeared after the prayer."[^apd-birth] (The Greek word for eagle, *aietos*, was linked to *Aias*.) The Great Eoiae preserves the same tradition: "Heracles entertained by Telamon, standing dressed in his lion-skin and praying, and there also we find the eagle sent by Zeus, from which Aias took his name."[^ge-eagle]

[^ge-eagle]: "Heracles entertained by Telamon, standing dressed in his lion-skin and praying, and there also we find the eagle sent by Zeus, from which Aias took his name" (Great Eoiae, Fragment 3, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

Telamon also had a son Teucer by Hesione, daughter of Laomedon, whom he received as a prize when he accompanied Heracles against [Troy](../places/troy.md).

### The Trojan War (E.3.11-E.5.7)

Ajax brought twelve ships from Salamis.[^apd-ships] In the fighting, he was a dominant figure:

- When [Hector](hector.md) "challenged the bravest to single combat, many came forward, but the lot fell on Ajax, and he did doughty deeds; but night coming on, the heralds parted them."[^apd-duel]
- "Ajax having retreated, he [Hector] set fire to the ships."[^apd-retreat]
- After [Patroclus](patroclus.md) fell, "Ajax with difficulty, by performing feats of valor, rescued the body," while [Odysseus](odysseus.md) fought the assailants.[^apd-rescue]
- At Achilles' death, "Ajax killed Glaucus, and gave the arms to be conveyed to the ships, but the body he carried, in a shower of darts, through the midst of the enemy."[^apd-achilles-body]

### Madness and Death (E.5.6-7)

After Achilles' death, "his arms were offered as a prize to the bravest, and Ajax and Ulysses came forward as competitors. The judges were the Trojans or, according to some, the allies, and Ulysses was preferred."[^apd-judgment]

"Disordered by chagrin, Ajax planned a nocturnal attack on the army. And [Athena](../deities/athena.md) drove him mad, and turned him, sword in hand, among the cattle, and in his frenzy he slaughtered the cattle with the herdsmen, taking them for the Achaeans."[^apd-madness]

"Afterwards he came to his senses and slew also himself. And Agamemnon forbade his body to be burnt; and he alone of all who fell at Ilium is buried, in a coffin. His grave is at Rhoeteum."[^apd-death]

## In the Fabulae

### The Contest of Arms (§107)

The [Fabulae](../sources/hyginus.md) gives a terse account of the contest that ended Ajax's life. After [Achilles](achilles.md) was killed, "Telamonian Ajax demanded from the Danaans the arms of [Achilles](achilles.md), on the grounds that he was cousin on his father's side."[^hyg-demand] The claim was based on kinship: Telamon and Peleus were brothers, making Ajax and Achilles cousins.

But the judgment went against him: "Through the anger of Minerva they were denied him by Agamemnon and Menelaus, and given to Ulysses."[^hyg-denial] The Fabulae attributes [Athena](../deities/athena.md)'s hostility as the decisive factor in the outcome.

The result was tragic: "Ajax, harbouring rage, in madness slaughtered his flocks, and killed himself with that sword he had received from Hector as a gift when the two met in battle line."[^hyg-suicide] The reference to Hector's sword recalls their famous duel, where the two heroes exchanged gifts after fighting to a draw.

[^hyg-demand]: "After Hector's burial, when Achilles was wandering along the ramparts of the Trojans and saying that he alone had reduced Troy, Apollo in anger, taking the form of Alexander Paris, struck him with an arrows on the heel which was said to be vulnerable, and killed him. When Achilles was killed and given burial, Telamonian Ajax demanded from the Danaans the arms of Achilles, on the grounds that he was cousin on his father's side" (Fabulae §107, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-denial]: "Through the anger of Minerva they were denied him by Agamemnon and Menelaus, and given to Ulysses" (Fabulae §107, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-suicide]: "Ajax, harbouring rage, in madness slaughtered his flocks, and killed himself with that sword he had received from Hector as a gift when the two met in battle line" (Fabulae §107, trans. Mary Grant)

## In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md)

### The Contest of Arms (13.1-398)

Ovid gives Ajax's claim to [Achilles](achilles.md)' arms its fullest dramatic treatment. The chiefs sit in council, the soldiers forming a circle around them, and Ajax rises first. He appeals to his deeds rather than his words: "We plead, O Jupiter, our cause before the ships,--Ulysses vies with me! He did not shrink from giving way before the flames of Hector, when I withstood them and I saved the fleet."[^met-ajax-plea] He invokes his kinship with Achilles -- both grandsons of Aeacus -- and catalogues his battlefield exploits: shielding the fallen [Odysseus](odysseus.md), duelling Hector alone, and defending the Greek ships "with my breast, saving the hopes of your return."[^met-ajax-ships]

Ajax mocks Odysseus as a man of stealth and night-raids who "by stealth and quite unarmed, has always done his work, deceiving his unwary enemy."[^met-ajax-stealth] He challenges the assembly to a trial by combat rather than rhetoric, ending bluntly: "Let us be tried in war."[^met-ajax-trial]

[Odysseus](odysseus.md) responds with a long counter-speech (13.128-381), claiming credit for bringing Achilles to the war, for carrying his body from the field, and for stealing the Palladium from [Troy](../places/troy.md). The assembled chiefs are swayed: "the power of eloquence" prevails, and the arms are awarded to Odysseus.[^met-ajax-verdict]

### Suicide and the Hyacinth (13.382-398)

Ajax, "the unconquerable," is "conquered by his grief." He draws his sword and declares: "This is at least my own; or will Ulysses also claim this, for himself." He plunges the blade into his breast -- "which never had felt a wound" -- and from the blood-soaked earth springs a purple flower, the same hyacinth that grew from the blood of [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md)'s beloved: "Its petals now are charged with double freight -- the warrior's name, Apollo's cry of woe."[^met-ajax-death]

[^met-ajax-plea]: "We plead, O Jupiter, our cause before the ships,--Ulysses vies with me! He did not shrink from giving way before the flames of Hector, when I withstood them and I saved the fleet" (Metamorphoses 13.1-12, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-ajax-ships]: "I did protect a thousand ships with my breast, saving the hopes of your return" (Metamorphoses 13.90-94, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-ajax-stealth]: "by stealth and quite unarmed, has always done his work, deceiving his unwary enemy" (Metamorphoses 13.103-105, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-ajax-trial]: "Let us be tried in war. Let all the arms of brave Achilles now be thrown among the foe; order them all to be retrieved; and decorate for war whoever brings them back" (Metamorphoses 13.120-126, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-ajax-verdict]: "The assembled body of the chiefs was moved; and then, appeared the power of eloquence: the fluent man received, amid applause, the arms of the brave man" (Metamorphoses 13.382-385, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-ajax-death]: "The unconquerable was conquered by his grief. He drew his sword, and said:--'This is at least my own; or will Ulysses also claim this, for himself'... The ensanguined earth sprouted from her green turf that purple flower which grew of old from Hyacinthine blood. Its petals now are charged with double freight--the warrior's name, Apollo's cry of woe" (Metamorphoses 13.386-398, trans. Brookes More)

## In [Pindar](../sources/pindar.md)

### Homer's Ajax vs. the True Ajax (Nemean VII)

Pindar makes a pointed observation about the injustice done to Ajax's reputation: "the fame of Odysseus is become greater than his toils, through the sweet lays that Homer sang; for over the feigning of his winged craft something of majesty abideth, and the excellence of his skill persuadeth us to his fables unaware."[^pin-nem7-odysseus]

He then makes explicit what he considers the historical truth: "Blind hearts have the general folk of men; for could they have discovered the truth, never would stalwart Aias in anger for the arms have struck through his midriff the sharp sword — even he who after Achilles was best in battle of all men."[^pin-nem7-ajax]

[^pin-nem7-odysseus]: "the fame of Odysseus is become greater than his toils, through the sweet lays that Homer sang; for over the feigning of his winged craft something of majesty abideth, and the excellence of his skill persuadeth us to his fables unaware" (Pindar, Nemean VII, trans. Ernest Myers)
[^pin-nem7-ajax]: "Blind hearts have the general folk of men; for could they have discovered the truth, never would stalwart Aias in anger for the arms have struck through his midriff the sharp sword — even he who after Achilles was best in battle of all men" (Pindar, Nemean VII)

### Envy and the Secret Vote (Nemean VIII)

Pindar returns to this injustice in Nemean VIII, with even more bitter phrasing: "thus did envy slay the son of Telamon, thrusting him through with his own sword." The reason was corruption in the vote: "in the secret giving of their votes the Danaoi courted Odysseus, and thus did Aias, robbed of the golden arms, wrestle in the grip of a bloody death."[^pin-nem8-envy]

[^pin-nem8-envy]: "envy slay the son of Telamon, thrusting him through with his own sword... in the secret giving of their votes the Danaoi courted Odysseus, and thus did Aias, robbed of the golden arms, wrestle in the grip of a bloody death" (Pindar, Nemean VIII, trans. Ernest Myers)

### The Eagle and His Naming (Isthmian V)

The fullest Pindaric account of Ajax's birth and naming appears in Isthmian V (see also [Heracles](heracles.md)'s page for the prayer scene). [Heracles](heracles.md) found Telamon feasting, and prayed to Zeus for a son "of body as staunch as this hide that hangeth about me." Zeus "sent forth the king of birds, a mighty eagle, and sweet delight thrilled him within." Then Heracles prophesied: "after the bird's name that had appeared unto them he said that the child's name should be the mighty Aias, terrible in the strife of warring hosts."[^pin-ist5-naming]

[^pin-ist5-naming]: "after the bird's name that had appeared unto them he said that the child's name should be the mighty Aias, terrible in the strife of warring hosts" (Pindar, Isthmian V, trans. Ernest Myers)

## In Sophocles' Ajax

Sophocles' [Ajax](../sources/sophocles-ajax.md) is the fullest dramatic treatment of the hero's final hours.

### Athena's Display of Ajax's Madness

The play opens after the judgment of [Achilles](achilles.md)' arms has already gone to [Odysseus](odysseus.md). In the night, Ajax armed himself and set out to kill the Greek commanders — but [Athena](../deities/athena.md) "turned delusive phantasies upon him" and redirected his fury onto the camp's livestock.[^soph-aj-phantasy] She summons the still-deranged Ajax before Odysseus, who watches in horror. Despite their rivalry, Odysseus responds with pity: "I pity him, for all that he is my foe... I think of mine own lot no less than his. For I see well, none of us that live are more than phantoms all, or empty shadow."[^soph-aj-pity]

Athena draws a moral from the spectacle: "See then, and utter thou no swelling speech against the gods, nor take upon thee any boast of pride... A day can press down all things human, and a day can raise them up. The wise of heart are those whom Heaven loves, but the perverse are hated."[^soph-aj-athena-moral]

### The Night's Events (Tecmessa's Account)

[Tecmessa](tecmessa.md), Ajax's captive-wife, describes the night to the chorus. Ajax left armed in darkness, returned dragging sheep and cattle into the tent, and tortured them — "some he beheaded; some, wrenching back the throat, he cleft in twain; others, bound as they were, he kept assailing, wreaking on the cattle his wrath, as if they had been men."[^soph-aj-slaughter] He took a ram and lashed it to a pillar, beating it with a doubled horse-rein and cursing it as Odysseus.[^soph-aj-ram]

### Ajax's Lament

When Ajax emerges from the tent amid the carnage, lucid again, his first words are: "Darkness! my only light! / Gloom, to my soul more bright than sunniest sky! / Take, take me to your realm."[^soph-aj-darkness] He laments that his father [Telamon](telamon.md) "won the prime crown of valour before the Trojan walls," while he, who came "with no less might," is ruined: "trampled upon with foul indignity, / Thrust down from every honour."[^soph-aj-telamon]

He considers returning home — impossible, since he cannot face his father empty-handed. He cannot fight on against Troy. He resolves on death: "For the brave man there's but one lot — to live with honour, or with honour die."[^soph-aj-honour]

### The Deception Speech

Ajax emerges again and speaks of yielding to the gods and to time: "all things dread and strong / Bow to authority. Winter's snowy roads / Yield to the mellow fruitage of the year."[^soph-aj-deception] He speaks of going to purify himself by the sea and burying his sword. The speech is deliberately ambiguous — the chorus rejoices, thinking he has relented, but Ajax is in fact preparing for death.

### Suicide

Alone on the seashore, Ajax plants [Hector](hector.md)'s sword upright in the earth. He prays to [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) to send [Teucer](teucer.md) first to find and protect his body; to [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md) for easy passage to death; to the [Erinyes](../creatures/erinyes.md) to punish the Atreidae; and to [Helius](../deities/helius.md) to carry word of his death to his parents in [Salamis](../places/salamis.md). His final words: "O fair light! / O sacred fields of Salamis my home!... Ah, Troy! and ye proud Trojan men-at-arms, / Know all my greatness, whom ye have given to die!"[^soph-aj-death] He falls on the sword.

### Hector's Sword

[Teucer](teucer.md), lamenting over the body, reflects on the fateful exchange of gifts after the duel between Ajax and [Hector](hector.md): "This was Hector's gift... the sword he fell on. The gird he gave to Hector was the gird / Whence bound unto the rail he hung and rolled / And ever was chafed, till he gave up the ghost."[^soph-aj-gifts] Both gifts proved deadly to their recipients.

### The Burial Dispute

[Menelaus](menelaus.md) arrives and forbids burial, declaring Ajax an insubordinate enemy. Teucer defies him: Ajax came to [Troy](../places/troy.md) as a free commander, not Menelaus's subject.[^soph-aj-teucer-defiance]

[Agamemnon](agamemnon.md) then joins, insulting Teucer's birth — his mother [Hesione](hesione.md) was a captive — calling him the son of a "she-captive" and a "barbarous" mother.[^soph-aj-agamemnon] Teucer retorts that Agamemnon's own grandfather Pelops was "a barbarian, a Phrygian," and his father Atreus served his brother the "abominable dire feast of his own flesh."[^soph-aj-teucer-retort] He catalogues Ajax's battlefield deeds — defending the ships when Hector reached them, fighting Hector in single combat — and threatens to die defending the body.

### Odysseus's Intervention

[Odysseus](odysseus.md) arrives and, to general surprise, argues for burial: "Be not so hard thus without ruth tombless to cast him forth; nor be so vanquished by a vehement will, that to thy hate even Justice' self must bow."[^soph-aj-odysseus1] He acknowledges Ajax was his worst enemy but declares him, "save Achilles' self," the noblest Argive at Troy. When Agamemnon protests, Odysseus delivers the play's moral centre-point: "Hatred gives way to magnanimity."[^soph-aj-magnanimity]

Agamemnon yields reluctantly. Teucer praises Odysseus as "best of men" but declines his offer to help with the rites, fearing it might offend Ajax's spirit. Odysseus accepts gracefully.[^soph-aj-best]

[^soph-aj-phantasy]: "I turned delusive phantasies upon him, and launched him on the flocks and mingled droves yet unallotted, the herdsmen's spoil of war" (Sophocles, Ajax, trans. Lewis Campbell)
[^soph-aj-pity]: "I pity him, for all that he is my foe, seeing he is bound fast to a dreadful doom. I think of mine own lot no less than his. For I see well, none of us that live are more than phantoms all, or empty shadow" (Sophocles, Ajax)
[^soph-aj-athena-moral]: "See then, and utter thou no swelling speech against the gods, nor take upon thee any boast of pride... A day can press down all things human, and a day can raise them up. The wise of heart are those whom Heaven loves, but the perverse are hated" (Sophocles, Ajax)

[^soph-aj-teucer-retort]: "Who was thy father's father? A barbarian, Pelops, the Phrygian, if you trace him far! And what was Atreus, thine own father? One who served his brother with the abominable dire feast of his own flesh" (Sophocles, Ajax)

## In the Posthomerica

### Defence of Achilles' Body (Book III)

When [Achilles](achilles.md) fell, Ajax was the first to act. He "bestrode the dead" and thrust back [Paris](paris.md), Glaucus, [Aeneas](aeneas.md), and Agenor with his long lance. He killed Glaucus over the corpse, and wounded Aeneas in the right forearm. [Odysseus](odysseus.md) fought beside him, but it was Ajax who single-handedly routed the entire Trojan host back to their walls, then carried Achilles' giant body to the ships — "yet never touched he with his feet the ground, but aye he trod on dead men, arms, and blood."[^post-body]

### The Judgment of Arms (Book V)

[Thetis](../deities/thetis.md) set down Achilles' divine arms as the prize for whoever best rescued the body. Both Ajax and [Odysseus](odysseus.md) claimed them. [Nestor](nestor.md) suggested Trojan captives as impartial judges. Ajax made an impassioned speech, boasting: "I with heart unquailing there stood fast facing the fire and Hector" and accusing Odysseus of cowardice: "Thy dam bare thee a craven and a weakling wretch." He challenged Odysseus to trial by combat: "Silver-footed Thetis set in the midst this prize for prowess, not for pestilent words."[^post-speech] Odysseus countered with his own achievements. The Trojan captives judged Odysseus the greater threat.

### Madness, Slaughter, and Death (Book V)

Ajax "would none of meat or drink, nor clasped him round the arms of sleep." He armed himself with sword drawn, planning to set the ships aflame and slaughter the Greeks — "nay, had soon accomplished all, had Pallas not with madness smitten him; for over Odysseus, strong to endure, her heart yearned." He fell on the sheep like a lion, "deeming he dealt to Danaans evil doom." Standing over a slaughtered ram, he laughed and mocked it as Odysseus: "Lie there in dust; be meat for dogs and kites! Achilles' glorious arms have saved not thee."[^post-madness]

When [Athena](../deities/athena.md) lifted the madness, Ajax saw the sheep and "sore amazed he stood, for he divined that by the Blessed Ones his senses had been cheated." He lamented: "Ah me! why do the Gods abhor me so?" Then "he thrust the sword of Hector through his throat. Forth rushed the blood in torrent: in the dust outstretched he lay, like Typhon, when the bolts of Zeus had blasted him."[^post-death2]

Teucer nearly killed himself in grief. [Tecmessa](tecmessa.md), his captive-bride, wailed over him: "All thine heart was kindness unto me the hapless, and thou madest me thy wife... thou promisedst to throne me queen of fair-towered Salamis." Agamemnon promised to protect her and their son Eurysaces. Odysseus spoke with genuine remorse: "Would to God that ne'er yon Trojans in the strife for Achilles' arms had crowned me with that victory... had mine heart foreboded aught of this... never for victory had I striven with him."[^post-odysseus-remorse] Ajax was burned on a great pyre, his bones placed in a golden casket, and buried beside Rhoeteium's headland.

[^post-body]: "yet never touched he with his feet the ground, but aye he trod on dead men, arms, and blood; for countless corpses lay o'er that wide stretch even from broad-wayed Troy to Hellespont" (Posthomerica 3.2721-2725, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post-speech]: "I with heart unquailing there stood fast facing the fire and Hector... Silver-footed Thetis set in the midst this prize for prowess, not for pestilent words" (Posthomerica 5.4206-4231, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post-madness]: "Lie there in dust; be meat for dogs and kites! Achilles' glorious arms have saved not thee, for which thy folly strove with a better man!" (Posthomerica 5.4481-4483, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post-death2]: "he thrust the sword of Hector through his throat. Forth rushed the blood in torrent: in the dust outstretched he lay, like Typhon, when the bolts of Zeus had blasted him" (Posthomerica 5.4531-4534, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post-odysseus-remorse]: "Would to God that ne'er yon Trojans in the strife for Achilles' arms had crowned me with that victory... had mine heart foreboded aught of this, this desperation of a soul distraught, never for victory had I striven with him" (Posthomerica 5.4647-4658, trans. A.S. Way)
