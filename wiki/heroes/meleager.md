## Overview

**Meleager** was the prince of Calydon and the hero who slew the great boar sent by [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md) to ravage his father's lands. His life was bound to a magical firebrand: the [Fates](../deities/groups/fates.md) decreed at his birth that he would live only as long as the brand remained unburnt. When Meleager killed his mother Althaea's brothers in a dispute over the boar's spoils, she burned the brand and he died. His story, told as a cautionary parallel to [Achilles](achilles.md)' wrath in the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md), became one of the most frequently retold myths of the Greek tradition.

## In the Iliad

In the Catalogue of Ships, Meleager is already dead: "golden-haired Meleagros was dead, to whose hands all had been committed, for him to be king of the Aitolians."[^il2-catalogue]

In Book IX, Phoenix tells Meleager's story at length as a warning to [Achilles](achilles.md), who has withdrawn from battle in anger. [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md) sent the boar because Oeneus "forgot Artemis alone" in his sacrifices, and Meleager slew it. But the goddess "made much turmoil over him and tumult concerning the boar's head and shaggy hide, between the Kuretes and great-hearted Aitolians."[^il9-boar]

In the Iliad's version, there is no firebrand — instead, Meleager withdrew from battle "in anger of heart at his dear mother Althaia" because she had cursed him. She "prayed instantly to the gods, and with her hands likewise beat instantly upon the fertile earth, calling on Hades and dread Persephone, while she knelt upon her knees and made her bosom wet with tears, to bring her son to death; and Erinnys that walketh in darkness, whose heart knoweth not ruth, heard her from Erebos."[^il9-curse]

As war pressed on the city, elders, priests, his father, his sisters, even his mother begged him to return — "but he denied them yet more." Only when the enemy "were climbing upon the towers and firing the great city" did his wife Cleopatra persuade him by describing "all the woes that come on men whose city is taken; the warriors are slain, and the city is wasted of fire, and the children and the deep-girdled women are led captive of strangers." He relented and saved the Aitolians, but "they paid him not now the gifts many and gracious."[^il9-return]

[^il2-catalogue]: "golden-haired Meleagros was dead, to whose hands all had been committed, for him to be king of the Aitolians" (Iliad 2.642-643, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il9-boar]: "the goddess made much turmoil over him and tumult concerning the boar's head and shaggy hide, between the Kuretes and great-hearted Aitolians" (Iliad 9.543-549, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il9-curse]: "in anger of heart at his dear mother Althaia he tarried beside his wedded wife, fair Kleopatra... she, grieved for her brethren's death, prayed instantly to the gods, and with her hands likewise beat instantly upon the fertile earth, calling on Hades and dread Persephone... and Erinnys that walketh in darkness, whose heart knoweth not ruth, heard her from Erebos" (Iliad 9.555-572, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il9-return]: "his fair-girdled wife pray Meleagros with lamentation, and told him all the woes that come on men whose city is taken... So he saved the Aitolians from the evil day, obeying his own will; but they paid him not now the gifts many and gracious" (Iliad 9.590-599, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

## In the Bibliotheca

[Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) gives the version with the firebrand. "Althaea had also a son Meleager, by Oeneus, though they say that he was begotten by Ares." When he was seven days old, "the Fates came and declared that Meleager should die when the brand burning on the hearth was burnt out. On hearing that, Althaea snatched up the brand and deposited it in a chest."[^apd-brand]

Apollodorus provides the full roster of heroes assembled for the hunt. When Cepheus and Ancaeus disdained to hunt with a woman, "Meleager compelled them to follow the chase with her, for he desired to have a child also by [Atalanta](atalanta.md), though he had to wife Cleopatra." Atalanta was the first to wound the boar; "but Meleager killed it by a stab in the flank, and on receiving the skin gave it to Atalanta."[^apd-hunt]

The sons of Thestius took the skin, claiming it by birth-right. "But Meleager in a rage slew the sons of Thestius and gave the skin to Atalanta. However, from grief at the slaughter of her brothers Althaea kindled the brand, and Meleager immediately expired."[^apd-death]

Apollodorus notes the variant: "some say that Meleager did not die in that way, but that when the sons of Thestius claimed the skin... war broke out between the Curetes and the Calydonians" — matching the Iliad's version where Meleager withdrew from battle and was cursed by his mother. "After the death of Meleager, Althaea and Cleopatra hanged themselves, and the women who mourned the dead man were turned into birds."[^apd-variant]

[^apd-brand]: "when he was seven days old, the Fates came and declared that Meleager should die when the brand burning on the hearth was burnt out. On hearing that, Althaea snatched up the brand and deposited it in a chest" (Bibliotheca 1.8.2, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-hunt]: "Meleager compelled them to follow the chase with her, for he desired to have a child also by Atalanta... Atalanta was the first to shoot the boar in the back with an arrow... but Meleager killed it by a stab in the flank, and on receiving the skin gave it to Atalanta" (Bibliotheca 1.8.2, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-death]: "Meleager in a rage slew the sons of Thestius and gave the skin to Atalanta. However, from grief at the slaughter of her brothers Althaea kindled the brand, and Meleager immediately expired" (Bibliotheca 1.8.3, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-variant]: "some say that Meleager did not die in that way... After the death of Meleager, Althaea and Cleopatra hanged themselves, and the women who mourned the dead man were turned into birds" (Bibliotheca 1.8.3, trans. J.G. Frazer)

## In the Metamorphoses

[Ovid](../sources/metamorphoses.md) gives the most elaborate telling (Book 8). When Meleager saw [Atalanta](atalanta.md) among the hunters, her face "as maidenly for boy, or boyish for girl," he "at once longed for her beauty, though some god forbade. The fires of love flamed in him."[^met-atalanta]

After the hunt, Meleager gave the skin to Atalanta. The sons of Thestius seized it; Meleager killed them. Ovid devotes his greatest attention to Althaea's internal conflict. She recalled the Fates' prophecy at Meleager's birth: "Unto you we give, O child new-born! only the life of this; the period of this billet is your life." She stood before the fire and "four times prepared to cast the fatal billet in the midst; and four times hesitated to commit the dreadful deed." The struggle between mother-love and sisterly vengeance is compared to a ship caught between wind and tide: "so did Althaea hesitate between the conflict of her passions."[^met-althaea]

In her final speech she cries: "I am avenging and committing crime! With death must death be justified and crime be added unto crime!" She casts the brand into the fire, and Meleager, far away, "felt a sudden burning in his vitals" and "groaned in torture from the hidden fire." His last words express bewilderment that his death comes not on the battlefield: he calls out for his father, brothers, sisters, wife, and mother — "and even for his mother."[^met-death]

[^met-atalanta]: "Her face appeared as maidenly for boy, or boyish for girl. When Meleager saw her, he at once longed for her beauty, though some god forbade. The fires of love flamed in him" (Metamorphoses 8.322-325, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-althaea]: "Unto you we give, O child new-born! only the life of this; the period of this billet is your life... four times prepared to cast the fatal billet in the midst; and four times hesitated... so did Althaea hesitate between the conflict of her passions" (Metamorphoses 8.451-475, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-death]: "I am avenging and committing crime! With death must death be justified" (Metamorphoses 8.477-525, trans. Brookes More)

## Variant Traditions

The two main traditions differ on the cause of Meleager's death:
- **The firebrand** ([Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md), [Ovid](../sources/metamorphoses.md)): The Fates tied his life to a brand at birth; Althaea preserved it but burned it after he killed her brothers.
- **The curse** ([Iliad](../sources/iliad.md)): Althaea called upon Hades, Persephone, and the Erinyes to bring her son to death; no firebrand is mentioned.

Apollodorus explicitly notes both versions. The firebrand tradition is generally considered older (attributed to the lost epic *Meleagris* and to Bacchylides' fifth ode).
