## Overview

**Perseus** is a hero who slew the Gorgon [Medusa](../creatures/gorgons.md) and rescued [Andromeda](andromeda.md) from a sea monster. Son of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) and [Danae](danae.md), he was raised on the island of Seriphus and undertook his quest for the Gorgon's head at the scheming of King Polydectes. After his exploits, he founded Mycenae and became ancestor of the Perseid dynasty.

## Mythology

"When Perseus cut off her head, there sprang forth great Chrysaor and the horse [Pegasus](../creatures/pegasus.md) who is so called because he was born near the springs (*pegae*) of Ocean."[^theog-medusa]

[^theog-medusa]: "And when Perseus cut off her head, there sprang forth great Chrysaor and the horse Pegasus who is so called because he was born near the springs (pegae) of Ocean; and that other, because he held a golden blade (aor) in his hands." (Theogony 280-283, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## In the [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md)

Apollodorus provides the most complete surviving account of the Perseus myth, covering his birth, quest, and aftermath.

### Birth and Casting Out

Acrisius, king of Argos, learned from an oracle that his daughter's son would kill him. To prevent this, he imprisoned [Danae](danae.md) underground: "Acrisius built a brazen chamber under ground and there guarded Danae."[^apd-brazen-chamber] But [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) reached her nonetheless, as a stream of gold pouring through the roof into her lap, and she bore a son, Perseus.[^apd-zeus-gold]

When Acrisius discovered the child, "he would not believe that she had been seduced by Zeus, and putting his daughter with the child in a chest, he cast it into the sea."[^apd-chest] The chest washed ashore on Seriphus, where a fisherman named Dictys took up the boy and reared him.

### Polydectes' Scheme

Polydectes, brother of Dictys and king of Seriphus, desired [Danae](danae.md) "but could not get access to her, because Perseus was grown to man's estate."[^apd-polydectes] So Polydectes devised a scheme, calling together his friends under the pretext of collecting contributions for a wedding gift. When Perseus boasted "that he would not stick even at the Gorgon's head," Polydectes seized on the claim and ordered him to bring it.[^apd-gorgon-boast]

### The Quest for the Gorgon's Head

Guided by [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md) and [Athena](../deities/athena.md), Perseus first sought out the Phorcides (Enyo, Pephredo, and Dino), daughters of Phorcus by Ceto and sisters of the [Gorgons](../creatures/gorgons.md). These were "old women from their birth" who shared a single eye and a single tooth, passing them to each other in turn.[^apd-phorcides] Perseus seized the eye and the tooth, and refused to return them until the Phorcides showed him the way to certain nymphs.

The nymphs provided three magical items: winged sandals, the kibisis (a special wallet), and the cap of [Hades](../deities/hades.md) which rendered the wearer invisible.[^apd-nymph-gifts] [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md) gave him an adamantine sickle. Thus equipped, "he flew to the ocean and caught the Gorgons asleep."[^apd-flew-ocean]

### Slaying of Medusa

Apollodorus names all three [Gorgons](../creatures/gorgons.md) -- Stheno, Euryale, and Medusa -- and notes that "Medusa alone was mortal; for that reason Perseus was sent to fetch her head."[^apd-medusa-mortal] He gives a vivid physical description: "the Gorgons had heads twined about with the scales of dragons, and great tusks like swine's, and brazen hands, and golden wings, by which they flew; and they turned to stone such as beheld them."[^apd-gorgon-desc]

The killing itself is narrated precisely: "Perseus stood over them as they slept, and while [Athena](../deities/athena.md) guided his hand and he looked with averted gaze on a brazen shield, in which he beheld the image of the Gorgon, he beheaded her."[^apd-beheading] From her severed neck sprang [Pegasus](../creatures/pegasus.md) and Chrysaor, whom she had conceived by [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md).

Perseus placed the head in the kibisis and departed. The surviving Gorgons "started up from their slumber and pursued Perseus: but they could not see him on account of the cap, for he was hidden by it."[^apd-pursuit]

### Rescue of Andromeda

Coming to Ethiopia, Perseus found [Andromeda](andromeda.md), daughter of King Cepheus, chained to a rock as prey for a sea monster. Her mother Cassiepea had "vied with the Nereids in beauty and boasted to be better than them all," provoking [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) to send a flood and a monster against the land.[^apd-cassiepea] An oracle of Ammon had demanded Andromeda's exposure as the price of deliverance.

"When Perseus beheld her, he loved her and promised Cepheus that he would kill the monster, if he would give him the rescued damsel to wife."[^apd-perseus-love] He slew the monster and freed Andromeda. When Phineus, brother of Cepheus and Andromeda's original betrothed, plotted against him, Perseus "by showing the Gorgon turned him and his fellow conspirators at once into stone."[^apd-phineus]

### Return to Seriphus

Returning to Seriphus, Perseus found that his mother and Dictys "had taken refuge at the altars on account of the violence of Polydectes."[^apd-altars] He entered the palace where Polydectes had gathered his friends, "and with averted face he showed the Gorgon's head; and all who beheld it were turned to stone, each in the attitude which he happened to have struck."[^apd-polydectes-stone] Perseus made Dictys king of Seriphus.

He then returned his magical equipment: the sandals, kibisis, and cap went to [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md) (who restored them to the nymphs), and "the Gorgon's head he gave to [Athena](../deities/athena.md)," who set it in the middle of her shield.[^apd-athena-shield]

### Death of Acrisius

Perseus went to Argos to see Acrisius, but Acrisius, "learning of this and dreading the oracle, forsook Argos and departed to the Pelasgian land."[^apd-acrisius-fled] At Larissa, where King Teutamides was holding athletic games, Perseus competed in the pentathlon. "In throwing the quoit he struck Acrisius on the foot and killed him instantly."[^apd-discus] The oracle was fulfilled by accident.

### Kingdom Exchange

"Being ashamed to return to Argos to claim the inheritance of him who had died by his hand," Perseus went to Megapenthes, son of Proetus, at Tiryns and exchanged kingdoms with him.[^apd-exchange] Megapenthes took Argos; Perseus took Tiryns and "fortifying also Midea and Mycenae."[^apd-mycenae]
