## Overview

**Perseus** is a hero who slew the Gorgon [Medusa](../creatures/gorgons.md) and rescued [Andromeda](andromeda.md) from a sea monster. Son of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) and [Danae](danae.md), he was raised on the island of Seriphus and undertook his quest for the Gorgon's head at the scheming of King Polydectes. After his exploits, he founded Mycenae and became ancestor of the Perseid dynasty.

## Mythology

"When Perseus cut off her head, there sprang forth great Chrysaor and the horse [Pegasus](../creatures/pegasus.md) who is so called because he was born near the springs (*pegae*) of Ocean."[^theog-medusa]

[^theog-medusa]: "And when Perseus cut off her head, there sprang forth great Chrysaor and the horse Pegasus who is so called because he was born near the springs (pegae) of Ocean; and that other, because he held a golden blade (aor) in his hands." (Theogony 280-283, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## In the [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md)

Apollodorus provides the most complete surviving account of the Perseus myth, covering his birth, quest, and aftermath.

### Birth and Casting Out

Acrisius, king of Argos, learned from an oracle that his daughter's son would kill him. To prevent this, he imprisoned [Danae](danae.md) underground: "Acrisius built a brazen chamber under ground and there guarded Danae."[^apd-brazen-chamber] But [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) reached her nonetheless, as a stream of gold pouring through the roof into her lap, and she bore a son, Perseus.[^apd-zeus-gold]

When Acrisius discovered the child, "he would not believe that she had been seduced by Zeus, and putting his daughter with the child in a chest, he cast it into the sea."[^apd-chest] The chest washed ashore on Seriphus, where a fisherman named Dictys took up the boy and reared him.

### Polydectes' Scheme

Polydectes, brother of Dictys and king of Seriphus, desired [Danae](danae.md) "but could not get access to her, because Perseus was grown to man's estate."[^apd-polydectes] So Polydectes devised a scheme, calling together his friends under the pretext of collecting contributions for a wedding gift. When Perseus boasted "that he would not stick even at the Gorgon's head," Polydectes seized on the claim and ordered him to bring it.[^apd-gorgon-boast]

### The Quest for the Gorgon's Head

Guided by [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md) and [Athena](../deities/athena.md), Perseus first sought out the Phorcides (Enyo, Pephredo, and Dino), daughters of Phorcus by Ceto and sisters of the [Gorgons](../creatures/gorgons.md). These were "old women from their birth" who shared a single eye and a single tooth, passing them to each other in turn.[^apd-phorcides] Perseus seized the eye and the tooth, and refused to return them until the Phorcides showed him the way to certain nymphs.

The nymphs provided three magical items: winged sandals, the kibisis (a special wallet), and the cap of [Hades](../deities/hades.md) which rendered the wearer invisible.[^apd-nymph-gifts] [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md) gave him an adamantine sickle. Thus equipped, "he flew to the ocean and caught the Gorgons asleep."[^apd-flew-ocean]

### Slaying of Medusa

Apollodorus names all three [Gorgons](../creatures/gorgons.md) -- Stheno, Euryale, and Medusa -- and notes that "Medusa alone was mortal; for that reason Perseus was sent to fetch her head."[^apd-medusa-mortal] He gives a vivid physical description: "the Gorgons had heads twined about with the scales of dragons, and great tusks like swine's, and brazen hands, and golden wings, by which they flew; and they turned to stone such as beheld them."[^apd-gorgon-desc]

The killing itself is narrated precisely: "Perseus stood over them as they slept, and while [Athena](../deities/athena.md) guided his hand and he looked with averted gaze on a brazen shield, in which he beheld the image of the Gorgon, he beheaded her."[^apd-beheading] From her severed neck sprang [Pegasus](../creatures/pegasus.md) and Chrysaor, whom she had conceived by [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md).

Perseus placed the head in the kibisis and departed. The surviving Gorgons "started up from their slumber and pursued Perseus: but they could not see him on account of the cap, for he was hidden by it."[^apd-pursuit]

### Rescue of Andromeda

Coming to Ethiopia, Perseus found [Andromeda](andromeda.md), daughter of King Cepheus, chained to a rock as prey for a sea monster. Her mother Cassiepea had "vied with the Nereids in beauty and boasted to be better than them all," provoking [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) to send a flood and a monster against the land.[^apd-cassiepea] An oracle of Ammon had demanded Andromeda's exposure as the price of deliverance.

"When Perseus beheld her, he loved her and promised Cepheus that he would kill the monster, if he would give him the rescued damsel to wife."[^apd-perseus-love] He slew the monster and freed Andromeda. When Phineus, brother of Cepheus and Andromeda's original betrothed, plotted against him, Perseus "by showing the Gorgon turned him and his fellow conspirators at once into stone."[^apd-phineus]

### Return to Seriphus

Returning to Seriphus, Perseus found that his mother and Dictys "had taken refuge at the altars on account of the violence of Polydectes."[^apd-altars] He entered the palace where Polydectes had gathered his friends, "and with averted face he showed the Gorgon's head; and all who beheld it were turned to stone, each in the attitude which he happened to have struck."[^apd-polydectes-stone] Perseus made Dictys king of Seriphus.

He then returned his magical equipment: the sandals, kibisis, and cap went to [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md) (who restored them to the nymphs), and "the Gorgon's head he gave to [Athena](../deities/athena.md)," who set it in the middle of her shield.[^apd-athena-shield]

### Death of Acrisius

Perseus went to Argos to see Acrisius, but Acrisius, "learning of this and dreading the oracle, forsook Argos and departed to the Pelasgian land."[^apd-acrisius-fled] At Larissa, where King Teutamides was holding athletic games, Perseus competed in the pentathlon. "In throwing the quoit he struck Acrisius on the foot and killed him instantly."[^apd-discus] The oracle was fulfilled by accident.

### Kingdom Exchange

"Being ashamed to return to Argos to claim the inheritance of him who had died by his hand," Perseus went to Megapenthes, son of Proetus, at Tiryns and exchanged kingdoms with him.[^apd-exchange] Megapenthes took Argos; Perseus took Tiryns and "fortifying also Midea and Mycenae."[^apd-mycenae]

## In the Fabulae

### Danae and the Prophecy (§63)

Hyginus provides the fullest account of Perseus's birth and Acrisius's delayed recognition. "Danae was the daughter of Acrisius and Aganippe. A prophecy about her said that the child she bore would kill Acrisius, and Acrisius, fearing this, shut her in a stone-walled prison."[^hyg-63-prison] But [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) "changing into a shower of gold, lay with Danae, and from this embrace Perseus was born."[^hyg-63-gold]

"Because of her sin her father shut her up in a chest with Perseus and cast it into the sea. By Jove's will it was borne to the island of Seriphos, and when the fisherman Dictys found it and broke it open, he discovered the mother and child. He took them to King Polydectes, who married Danae and brought up Perseus in the temple of Minerva."[^hyg-63-seriphos]

> **NEW DETAIL:** Polydectes *marries* Danae in Hyginus, not merely desires her. Perseus is raised in [Athena](../deities/athena.md)'s temple, explaining the goddess's special protection.

Years later, "when Acrisius discovered they were staying at Polydectes' court, he started out to get them, but at his arrival Polydectes interceded for them, and Perseus swore an oath to his grandfather that he would never kill him."[^hyg-63-oath] Then "when Acrisius was detained there by a storm, Polydectes died, and at his funeral games the wind blew a discus from Perseus' hand at Acrisius' head which killed him. Thus what he did not do of his own will was accomplished by the gods."[^hyg-63-fulfilment] The oracle is fulfilled at Polydectes' funeral games, not at Larissa as in [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md).

[^hyg-63-prison]: "Danae was the daughter of Acrisius and Aganippe. A prophecy about her said that the child she bore would kill Acrisius, and Acrisius, fearing this, shut her in a stone-walled prison" (Fabulae §63, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-63-gold]: "Jove, changing into a shower of gold, lay with Danae, and from this embrace Perseus was born" (Fabulae §63, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-63-seriphos]: "Because of her sin her father shut her up in a chest with Perseus and cast it into the sea. By Jove's will it was borne to the island of Seriphos, and when the fisherman Dictys found it and broke it open, he discovered the mother and child. He took them to King Polydectes, who married Danae and brought up Perseus in the temple of Minerva" (Fabulae §63, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-63-oath]: "When Acrisius discovered they were staying at Polydectes' court, he started out to get them, but at his arrival Polydectes interceded for them, and Perseus swore an oath to his grandfather that he would never kill him" (Fabulae §63, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-63-fulfilment]: "When Acrisius was detained there by a storm, Polydectes died, and at his funeral games the wind blew a discus from Perseus' hand at Acrisius' head which killed him. Thus what he did not do of his own will was accomplished by the gods. When Polydectes was buried, Perseus set out for Argos and took possession of his grandfather's kingdom" (Fabulae §63, trans. Mary Grant)

### Andromeda (§64)

The [Andromeda](andromeda.md) rescue is told with vivid detail. "Cassiope claimed that her daughter Andromeda's beauty excelled the Nereids'. Because of this, Neptune demanded that Andromeda, Cepheus' daughter, be offered to a sea-monster."[^hyg-64-cassiope]

Perseus arrived "flying on Mercury's winged sandals" and "freed her from danger."[^hyg-64-rescue] But "when he wanted to marry her, Cepheus, her father, along with Agenor, her betrothed, planned to kill him. Perseus, discovering the plot, showed them the head of the Gorgon, and all were changed from human form into stone."[^hyg-64-stone]

The variant continues: "Perseus with Andromeda returned to his country. When Polydectes saw that Perseus was so courageous, he feared him and tried to kill him be treachery, but when Perseus discovered this he showed him the Gorgon's head, and he was changed from human form into stone."[^hyg-64-polydectes]

> **VARIANT:** In Hyginus, Polydectes dies *twice* — first at the funeral games where Acrisius is killed (§63), then petrified by the Gorgon's head (§64). This suggests conflicting traditions preserved in different sections of the Fabulae.

[^hyg-64-cassiope]: "Cassiope claimed that her daughter Andromeda's beauty excelled the Nereids'. Because of this, Neptune demanded that Andromeda, Cepheus' daughter, be offered to a sea-monster" (Fabulae §64, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-64-rescue]: "When she was offered, Perseus, flying on Mercury's winged sandals, is said to have come there and freed her from danger" (Fabulae §64, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-64-stone]: "When he wanted to marry her, Cepheus, her father, along with Agenor, her betrothed, planned to kill him. Perseus, discovering the plot, showed them the head of the Gorgon, and all were changed from human form into stone" (Fabulae §64, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-64-polydectes]: "Perseus with Andromeda returned to his country. When Polydectes saw that Perseus was so courageous, he feared him and tried to kill him be treachery, but when Perseus discovered this he showed him the Gorgon's head, and he was changed from human form into stone" (Fabulae §64, trans. Mary Grant)

## In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md)

### Atlas Turned to Mountain (4.604-662)

Flying over Libya with the Gorgon's head (from whose dripping blood "unnumbered serpents" were born), Perseus sought hospitality from [Atlas](../deities/atlas.md). Atlas refused, fearing a prophecy from Themis: "O Atlas! mark the day a son of Jupiter shall come to spoil; for when thy trees been stripped of golden fruit, the glory shall be his."[^met-per-atlas] When Atlas tried to drive him away by force, Perseus turned his own face aside and showed Medusa's head. "Atlas, huge and vast, becomes a mountain — His great beard and hair are forests, and his shoulders and his hands mountainous ridges, and his head the top of a high peak."[^met-per-atlas2]

### Rescue of Andromeda (4.663-803)

Perseus found [Andromeda](andromeda.md) chained to a rock: "as marble he would deem her, but the breeze moved in her hair, and from her streaming eyes the warm tears fell."[^met-per-andromeda] He declared his lineage and offered to fight the sea monster for her hand. The battle is vivid — Perseus fought "like the swift bird of Jove" diving on a serpent, thrusting his sword "sheer to the hilt, in its right shoulder."[^met-per-monster] When the monster fought back, Perseus found a rock to brace against, and thrust his sword "times more than three, unswerving in his aim, sheer through the monster's entrails."

### The Gorgon's Head (4.765-803)

Perseus told how he stole the single eye shared by two of Phorcys's daughters, then reached the Gorgon's lair: "I saw on all sides men and animals — like statues — turned to flinty stone at sight of dread Medusa's visage. Nevertheless reflected on the brazen shield, I bore upon my left, I saw her horrid face."[^met-per-gorgon] He struck while she slept, and from her blood "winged Pegasus" was born. Ovid adds that Medusa was once beautiful — "famed for beauty... Words would fail to tell the glory of her hair" — until [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) ravished her in [Athena](../deities/athena.md)'s temple, and Athena "changed the Gorgon's splendid hair to serpents horrible."[^met-per-medusa]

### The Wedding Battle (5.1-249)

At the wedding feast, Phineus (Andromeda's former betrothed) attacked with an armed mob. Perseus fought back with spear, sword, and finally the Gorgon's head, turning his enemies to stone. Even Phineus, who begged for mercy, was petrified: "he turned his face from the awful spectacle in vain; Medusa's head transformed him to a rigid block."

[^met-per-atlas]: "O Atlas! mark the day a son of Jupiter shall come to spoil; for when thy trees been stripped of golden fruit, the glory shall be his" (Metamorphoses 4.643-646, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-per-atlas2]: "Atlas, huge and vast, becomes a mountain—His great beard and hair are forests, and his shoulders and his hands mountainous ridges, and his head the top of a high peak" (Metamorphoses 4.657-661, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-per-andromeda]: "as marble he would deem her, but the breeze moved in her hair, and from her streaming eyes the warm tears fell. Her beauty so amazed his heart, unconscious captive of her charms, that almost his swift wings forgot to wave" (Metamorphoses 4.675-679, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-per-monster]: "so did the winged youth, in rapid flight through yielding elements, press down on the great monster's back, and thrust his sword, sheer to the hilt, in its right shoulder" (Metamorphoses 4.717-723, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-per-gorgon]: "I saw on all sides men and animals—like statues—turned to flinty stone at sight of dread Medusa's visage. Nevertheless reflected on the brazen shield, I bore upon my left, I saw her horrid face" (Metamorphoses 4.780-786, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-per-medusa]: "Beyond all others she was famed for beauty, and the envious hope of many suitors... the Sovereign of the Sea attained her love in chaste Minerva's temple... Minerva changed the Gorgon's splendid hair to serpents horrible" (Metamorphoses 4.794-803, trans. Brookes More)

## In [Pindar](../sources/pindar.md)

### Perseus and the Hyperboreans (Pythian X)

Pythian X briefly mentions Perseus's visit to the Hyperboreans as proof that miracles are possible when gods are involved. "In the eagerness of his valiant heart went of old the son of Danaë, for that Athene led him on his way, unto the company of that blessed folk." He "entered into their houses and feasted among them, when that he had lighted on them as they were sacrificing ample hecatombs of asses to their god."[^pin-hyperborean] After his visit: "Also he slew the Gorgon and bare home her head with serpent tresses decked, to the island folk a stony death."[^pin-gorgon-death]

### The Grey Sisters, Polydektes, and Danae (Pythian XII)

Pythian XII describes the achievements preceding the slaying of Medusa herself. Perseus "struck with blindness the wondrous brood of Phorkos" — the Grey Sisters, from whom he stole the eye — and "to Polydektes' bridal brought a grievous gift, and grievous eternally he made for that man his mother's slavery and ravished bed."[^pin-polydektes] This phrase presents Polydektes' scheme as an act of violence against Danae's freedom. Perseus's birth is glossed: "he who was the son of Danaë, and sprung, they say, from a living stream of gold."[^pin-gold-stream]

The occasion for [Athena](../deities/athena.md)'s invention of the flute was Perseus's destruction of Medusa: "Pallas Athene devised, when she made music of the fierce Gorgon's death-lament. That heard she pouring from the maiden heads and heads of serpents unapproachable amidst the anguish of their pains, when Perseus had stricken the third sister."[^pin-flute-origin]

[^pin-hyperborean]: "in the eagerness of his valiant heart went of old the son of Danaë, for that Athene led him on his way, unto the company of that blessed folk... entered into their houses and feasted among them, when that he had lighted on them as they were sacrificing ample hecatombs of asses to their god" (Pindar, Pythian X, trans. Ernest Myers)
[^pin-gorgon-death]: "Also he slew the Gorgon and bare home her head with serpent tresses decked, to the island folk a stony death" (Pindar, Pythian X, trans. Ernest Myers)
[^pin-polydektes]: "Yea also he struck with blindness the wondrous brood of Phorkos, and to Polydektes' bridal brought a grievous gift, and grievous eternally he made for that man his mother's slavery and ravished bed" (Pindar, Pythian XII, trans. Ernest Myers)
[^pin-gold-stream]: "he who was the son of Danaë, and sprung, they say, from a living stream of gold" (Pindar, Pythian XII, trans. Ernest Myers)
[^pin-flute-origin]: "Pallas Athenie devised, when she made music of the fierce Gorgon's death-lament. That heard she pouring from the maiden heads and heads of serpents unapproachable amidst the anguish of their pains, when Perseus had stricken the third sister" (Pindar, Pythian XII, trans. Ernest Myers)
