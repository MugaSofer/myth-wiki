## Overview

**Aineias** is the son of [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md) and the mortal Anchises, a prince of the Dardanian line descended from [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) through Dardanos. He is a major Trojan warrior in the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md), leader of the Dardanians, and the subject of a divine prophecy that his line will rule the Trojans after the fall of Priam's house. His conception and birth are told in [Homeric Hymn V](../sources/homeric-hymns.md), and he appears throughout the Iliad as a warrior repeatedly saved by the gods.

## Genealogy

The fullest genealogy is given by Aineias himself in [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book XX: "First [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) the cloud-gatherer begat Dardanos, and he stablished Dardania... Then Dardanos begat a son, king Erichthonios, who became richest of mortal men." Erichthonios begat Tros, "and to Tros three noble sons were born, Ilos and Assarakos and godlike Ganymedes, who became the most beautiful of mortal men. Him the gods caught up to be cupbearer to [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md), for sake of his beauty." The line continues: "Assarakos begat Kapys, and Kapys Anchises, and Anchises me; but Priam begat the goodly Hector."[^il20-genealogy]

Thus Aineias and Hector are of the same royal house but different branches: Aineias descends from Assarakos, Hector from Ilos.

## In the [Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) (V)

### The Seduction of Anchises

The Hymn tells how [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) "put in her heart sweet desire for Anchises who was tending cattle at that time among the steep hills of many-fountained Ida, and in shape was like the immortal gods."[^hh5-desire] [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md) went to him disguised as a mortal maiden. Anchises "was seized with love" and declared he would lie with her even "if far-shooting [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) himself should launch grievous shafts from his silver bow."[^hh5-anchises-love]

"Then by the will of the gods and destiny he lay with her, a mortal man with an immortal goddess, not clearly knowing what he did."[^hh5-union]

### Aphrodite's Revelation and Prophecy

When Aphrodite revealed her true form, "her head reached to the well-hewn roof-tree; from her cheeks shone unearthly beauty such as belongs to rich-crowned Cytherea." Anchises was terrified: "he who lies with a deathless goddess is no hale man afterwards."[^hh5-reveal]

Aphrodite reassured him and prophesied their son: "you shall have a dear son who shall reign among the Trojans, and children's children after him, springing up continually. His name shall be Aeneas, because I felt awful grief in that I laid me in the bed of mortal man."[^hh5-aeneas-name] The name Aineias is thus connected to the Greek word for "awful" (*ainos*).

### The Mountain Nymphs

Aphrodite told Anchises that "the deep-breasted mountain Nymphs who inhabit this great and holy mountain shall bring him up. They rank neither with mortals nor with immortals: long indeed do they live, eating heavenly food and treading the lovely dance among the immortals."[^hh5-nymphs] The nymphs would rear the child until boyhood, then bring him to Anchises.

### The Warning

Aphrodite forbade Anchises from ever revealing the child's true mother: "if you tell all and foolishly boast that you lay with rich-crowned Aphrodite, [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) will smite you in his anger with a smoking thunderbolt."[^hh5-warning]

She also lamented the loss of her power over the other gods: "now my mouth shall no more have this power among the gods; for very great has been my madness, my miserable and dreadful madness, and I went astray out of my mind who have gotten a child beneath my girdle, mating with a mortal man."[^hh5-shame]

## In the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md)

### Leader of the Dardanians (Book II)

In the Catalogue of Trojan forces, "the Dardanians were led of the princely son of Anchises, Aineias, whom bright [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md) conceived to Anchises amids the spurs of Ida, a goddess wedded to a mortal."[^il2-catalogue]

### Wounded by Diomedes; Rescued by Aphrodite and Apollo (Book V)

In Book V, Aineias and Pandaros ride together against Diomedes. Sthenelos warns Diomedes: "Aineias boasteth himself to be born son of great-hearted Anchises, and his mother is [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md)."[^il5-parentage] After Diomedes slays Pandaros, he strikes Aineias with a stone on the hip: "he crushed his cup-bone, and brake both sinews withal... and the darkness of night veiled his eyes."[^il5-wound]

Aphrodite rushed to save him: "About her dear son wound she her white arms, and spread before his face a fold of her radiant vesture, to be a covering from the darts."[^il5-aphrodite-rescue] But Diomedes, empowered by [Athena](../deities/athena.md), even wounded the goddess herself.

[Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) then took over Aineias's protection. When Diomedes "leapt upon Aineias, knowing full well that Apollo himself had spread his arms over him," the god beat him back three times, and on the fourth warned: "Think, Tydeides, and shrink, nor desire to match thy spirit with gods; seeing there is no comparison of the race of immortal gods and of men that walk upon the earth."[^il5-apollo-warning]

"Then Apollo set Aineias away from the throng in holy Pergamos where his temple stood. There Leto and Archer [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md) healed him in the mighty sanctuary, and gave him glory."[^il5-healed] Meanwhile Apollo "made a wraith like unto Aineias' self, and in such armour as his," over which both sides fought.[^il5-wraith]

When Aineias was fully healed, "Apollo himself sent forth Aineias from his rich sanctuary and put courage in the heart of him, shepherd of the hosts. So Aineias took his place amid his comrades, and they were glad to see him come among them alive and sound and full of valiant spirit."[^il5-return]

### Wroth with Priam (Book XIII)

In Book XIII, Aineias is found "standing the last in the press, for Aineias was ever wroth against goodly Priam, for that Priam gave him no honour, despite his valour among men."[^il13-wroth] He is roused to fight by Deiphobos and battles Idomeneus. The Cretan warrior acknowledges his danger: "terribly I dread the onslaught of swift-footed Aineias, that is assailing me; for he is right strong to destroy men in battle, and he hath the flower of youth, the greatest avail that may be."[^il13-idomeneus]

### Rallying the Trojans (Book XVII)

In Book XVII, [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) appears to Aineias disguised as the herald Periphas, urging him to fight for Patroklos's body. Aineias recognises the god and rallies the Trojans: "Hector and ye other leaders of the Trojans and their allies, shame were this if in our weakness overcome we were driven back into Ilios by the Achaians dear to [Ares](../deities/ares.md). Nay, thus saith a god, who standeth by my side: [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md), highest Orderer, is our helper in this fight."[^il17-rally]

### Duel with Achilles; Poseidon's Rescue and Prophecy (Book XX)

In Book XX, [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) (disguised as Lykaon) urges Aineias to face Achilles, reminding him of his divine parentage: "thou too, men say, wast born of [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md) daughter of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md), and Achilles' mother is of less degree among the gods. For thy mother is child of Zeus, his but of the Ancient One of the Sea."[^il20-apollo-urge]

Aineias is not eager: "Not for the first time now shall I match me with Achilles, fleet of foot; once before drave he me with his spear from Ida, when he harried our kine and wasted Lyrnessos and Pedasos; but Zeus delivered me out of his hand."[^il20-reluctance]

In the duel, Achilles's spear pierces two layers of Aineias's shield but is stopped; Aineias's spear penetrates two layers of Achilles's divine shield but the gold layer holds. As Achilles closes with his sword, [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) intervenes despite being on the Greek side:

"Alas, woe is me for Aineias great of heart, who quickly will go down to Hades slain by the son of Peleus... But wherefore now is he to suffer ill in his innocence, causelessly for others' wickedness, yet welcome ever are his offerings to the gods who inhabit the spacious heaven?"[^il20-poseidon-pity]

Poseidon then declares the prophecy: "it is appointed to him to escape, that the race of Dardanos perish not without seed or sign, even Dardanos whom the son of Kronos loved above all the children born to him from the daughters of men. For the race of Priam hath [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) already hated. But thus shall the might of Aineias reign among the Trojans, and his children's children, who shall be born in the aftertime."[^il20-prophecy]

Poseidon then "shed mist over the eyes of Achilles" and lifted Aineias bodily: "Over many ranks of warriors, of horses many, sprang Aineias soaring in the hand of the god."[^il20-rescue] He warned Aineias to avoid Achilles until the hero's death: "when Achilles shall have met his death and doom, then be thou of good courage to fight among the foremost, for there shall none other of the Achaians slay thee."[^il20-poseidon-warning]

Even Achilles recognised the divine favour: "Truly then is Aineias likewise dear to the immortal gods."[^il20-achilles-ack]

## In the [Epic Cycle](../sources/epic-cycle.md)

### Cypria

In the Cypria, [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md) "ordered Aeneas to sail with" Alexandros when Paris set out on his fateful voyage to Sparta.[^cyp-sail]

The Cypria also relates that Achilles "drove off the cattle of Aeneas, and sacked Lyrnessus and Pedasus" during the early campaigns around Troy.[^cyp-cattle] This is the same event Aineias recalls in Iliad XX.

### Sack of Ilium

In the Sack of Ilium, when the Trojans debated the wooden horse and "two serpents appeared and destroyed Laocoon and one of his two sons, a portent which so alarmed the followers of Aeneas that they withdrew to Ida."[^sack-ida]

### Little Iliad

In a fragment of the Little Iliad, Neoptolemus "put Aeneas, the famous son of horse-taming Anchises, on board his sea-faring ships, a prize surpassing those of all the Danaans."[^liliad-captive]
