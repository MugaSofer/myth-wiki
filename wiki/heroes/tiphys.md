# Tiphys

> "Tiphys, son of Hagnias, left the Siphaean people of the Thespians, well skilled to foretell the rising wave on the broad sea, and well skilled to infer from sun and star the stormy winds and the time for sailing. Tritonian Athena herself urged him to join the band of chiefs."[^arg1-intro]

## Overview

**Tiphys**, son of Hagnias, was the helmsman of the [Argo](../objects/argo.md) during the expedition for the [Golden Fleece](../objects/golden-fleece.md). He came from Siphae among the Thespians and was distinguished by his skill in reading the sea — able to foresee rising waves, to infer winds and sailing times from sun and star. [Athena](../deities/athena.md) herself urged him to join the expedition. He was also the one who woke the crew at dawn and first roused them to board the ship. He steered the Argo through the Symplegades and credited Athena with the ship's divine strength. He died of illness shortly after, during the crew's stay in Mariandynia, and his loss plunged the Argonauts into despair; Ancaeus then took over as helmsman.

## Powers

Tiphys's defining skill was his mastery of maritime signs: he was "well skilled to foretell the rising wave on the broad sea, and well skilled to infer from sun and star the stormy winds and the time for sailing."[^arg1-skill] This was a natural, craft-based expertise rather than a divine gift, though his recruitment to the voyage was itself prompted by [Athena](../deities/athena.md).

## In the Argonautica

### Joining the Expedition (Book I)

Tiphys was among the heroes assembled before [Jason](../heroes/jason.md). [Athena](../deities/athena.md) not only urged him to join, but had herself built the swift ship with Argus by her counsels: "She herself too fashioned the swift ship; and with her Argus, son of Arestor, wrought it by her counsels. Wherefore it proved the most excellent of all ships that have made trial of the sea with oars."[^arg1-ship]

After the benches were distributed by lot, the crew unanimously entrusted the helm to Tiphys: "with one consent they entrusted Tiphys with guarding the helm of the well-stemmed ship."[^arg1-helm]

### First to Wake the Crew (Book I)

On the morning of departure, Tiphys was the first to stir:

> "Now when gleaming dawn with bright eyes beheld the lofty peaks of Pelion, and the calm headlands were being drenched as the sea was ruffled by the winds, then Tiphys awoke from sleep; and at once he roused his comrades to go on board and make ready the oars."[^arg1-dawn]

Once the crew was aboard and the hawsers slipped, Tiphys guided the Argo out of the curving harbour: "they had left the curving shore of the harbour through the cunning and counsel of prudent Tiphys son of Hagnias, who skilfully handled the well-polished helm that he might guide them steadfastly."[^arg1-depart]

### The Symplegades (Book II)

At the Clashing Rocks, as Euphemus released the dove and the crew drove the Argo forward, it was at Tiphys's word that they rowed: "they, at the bidding of Tiphys, son of Hagnias, rowed with good will to drive Argo between the rocks, trusting to their strength."[^arg2-bidding]

When a massive wave rose before the ship and threatened to overwhelm it, "Tiphys was quick to ease the ship as she laboured with the oars; and in all its mass the wave rolled away beneath the keel, and at the stern it raised Argo herself and drew her far away from the rocks."[^arg2-wave]

After the passage was safely made, Tiphys was the first to speak in relief, attributing the success to [Athena](../deities/athena.md):

> "It is my hope that we have safely escaped this peril—we, and the ship; and none other is the cause so much as Athena, who breathed into Argo divine strength when Argus knitted her together with bolts; and she may not be caught."[^arg2-athena]

He went on to reassure Jason, saying that Phineus had foretold the later trials would be more easily accomplished.[^arg2-comfort]

### Death in Mariandynia (Book II)

Tiphys died shortly after [Idmon](../heroes/idmon.md), during the same stop at the Acherusian headland. The cause was illness:

> "the tale goes that Tiphys son of Hagnias died; nor was it his destiny thereafter to sail any further. But him there on the spot a short sickness laid to rest far from his native land, when the company had paid due honours to the dead son of Abas."[^arg2-death]

The crew's reaction to losing both their seer and their helmsman was one of complete despair:

> "at the cruel woe they were seized with unbearable grief. For when with due honours they had buried him also hard by the seer, they cast themselves down in helplessness on the sea-shore silently, closely wrapped up, and took no thought for meat or drink; and their spirit drooped in grief, for all hope of return was gone."[^arg2-grief]

The crew remained prostrate in grief until [Hera](../deities/hera.md) kindled courage in Ancaeus, son of Poseidon and Astypalaea, who was skilled in steering and who urged them to continue.[^arg2-ancaeus] After Ancaeus offered to take the helm, Euphemus, Erginus, and Nauplius also stepped forward, but the majority gave the place to Ancaeus.[^arg2-yield]
