## Overview

**Polyxena** was a daughter of [Priam](priam.md) and [Hecuba](hecuba.md), a Trojan princess sacrificed at [Achilles](achilles.md)' tomb after the fall of [Troy](../places/troy.md). Every source that describes her death emphasises her extraordinary courage — she refused to beg, demanded to die free rather than live as a slave, and died with modesty intact. Her sacrifice is one of the central atrocities of the post-war reckoning.

## In the Epic Cycle

The *Sack of Ilium* records simply: "The Greeks, after burning the city, sacrifice Polyxena at the tomb of [Achilles](achilles.md)."[^epic-sacrifice]

## In the Metamorphoses

[Achilles](achilles.md)' ghost rose from the earth on the Thracian shore, "as large as when he lived, with look as fierce," and demanded Polyxena's sacrifice: "let Polyxena be immolated to appease the ghost of dead Achilles."[^met-ghost]

The girl was "torn from her mother's bosom" and led to the altar, where she showed extraordinary courage: "Do not delay my generous gift of blood, with no resistance thrust the ready steel into my throat or breast! Polyxena would never wish to live in slavery."[^met-courage] She asked only that her body be returned to her mother: "King Priam's daughter, not a captive, pleads — freely return my body to my mother, let her not pay with gold for the sad right to bury me — but only with her tears!"[^met-plea]

Even the priest wept as he drove the steel into her breast, but "no one saw her shed one tear." Dying, "it was her care to cover all that ought to be concealed, and save the value of chaste modesty."[^met-modesty]

## In Euripides' Hecuba

In Euripides' [Hecuba](../sources/euripides-hecuba.md), Polyxena's sacrifice forms the first half of the play. Achilles' ghost appeared above his tomb "in his golden arms and restrained the fleet ships," demanding her blood.[^hec-ghost] [Odysseus](odysseus.md) persuaded the army to comply despite [Hecuba](hecuba.md)'s appeals to [xenia](../concepts/xenia.md).

Polyxena refused to beg for her life, declaring: "I die willingly; let none touch my body; for I will offer my neck to the sword with a good heart. But, by the Gods, let me go free while ye kill me, that I may die free, for to be classed as a slave among the dead, when a queen, is what I am ashamed of."[^hec-free] At the altar, she bared her breast: "Lo! strike, if this bosom thou desirest, O youth; or wouldest thou rather under the neck, here is this throat prepared."[^hec-strike] Even in death, "she showed much care to fall decently, and to veil from the eyes of men what ought to be concealed."[^hec-modesty]

## In Euripides' Trojan Women

In the [Trojan Women](../sources/euripides-trojan-women.md), Polyxena is already dead when the play opens. [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) notes in the prologue that "one child beside [Achilles](achilles.md)' grave in secret slain, Polyxena the brave, lies bleeding."[^tw-prologue]

Talthybius euphemistically tells [Hecuba](hecuba.md) that Polyxena "rests apart, to watch Achilles' tomb," and urges her to "count thy maid happy." Hecuba senses something wrong but cannot read the riddle.[^tw-euphemism] Later, [Andromache](andromache.md) reveals the truth plainly: "Polyxena across Achilles' tomb lies slain, a gift flung to the dreamless dead."[^tw-reveal] Andromache argues that Polyxena's death is sweeter than her own slavery: "To die is only not to be; and better to be dead than grievously living."[^tw-dead]

## In the Posthomerica

In the [Posthomerica](../sources/posthomerica.md), Achilles' ghost appeared to [Neoptolemus](neoptolemus.md) and demanded the sacrifice. [Hecuba](hecuba.md) recalled an ominous dream: "Herseemed that on Achilles' tomb she stood moaning, her hair down-streaming to the ground, and from her breasts blood dripped to earth."[^post-dream] [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) raised storms to enforce the demand; the storms ceased only after the sacrifice was performed.
