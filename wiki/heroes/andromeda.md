## Overview

**Andromeda** was a princess of Ethiopia, daughter of King Cepheus and Cassiepea. She was chained to a rock as a sacrifice to a sea monster sent by [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md), and rescued by [Perseus](perseus.md), whom she married.

### The Sea Monster

Andromeda's peril arose from her mother's vanity. Cassiepea "vied with the Nereids in beauty and boasted to be better than them all; hence the Nereids were angry, and [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md), sharing their wrath, sent a flood and a monster to invade the land."[^apd-and-monster] The oracle of Ammon declared that deliverance would come only if Andromeda were exposed to the monster, and "Cepheus was compelled by the Ethiopians to do it, and he bound his daughter to a rock."[^apd-and-bound]

### Rescue and Marriage

[Perseus](perseus.md), arriving from his slaying of Medusa, "beheld her" and "loved her and promised Cepheus that he would kill the monster, if he would give him the rescued damsel to wife. These terms having been sworn to, Perseus withstood and slew the monster and released Andromeda."[^apd-and-rescue]

### Phineus

After the rescue, Phineus -- a brother of Cepheus and Andromeda's original betrothed -- "plotted against him; but Perseus discovered the plot, and by showing the Gorgon turned him and his fellow conspirators at once into stone."[^apd-and-phineus]
