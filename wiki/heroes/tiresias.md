## Overview

**Tiresias** is the great blind seer of [Thebes](../places/thebes.md), whose gift of prophecy was compensation for his blindness. Multiple traditions explain how he lost and gained these powers, and he appears across the Theban saga and in [Odysseus](odysseus.md)'s consultation with the dead.

## In the Bibliotheca

### Blindness and Prophecy (3.6.7)

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) presents three traditions for Tiresias's blindness:

**1. Divine secrets:** "Some say that he was blinded by the gods because he revealed their secrets to men."[^apd-secrets]

**2. Athena:** "Pherecydes says that he was blinded by [Athena](../deities/athena.md); for Chariclo was dear to Athena... and Tiresias saw the goddess stark naked, and she covered his eyes with her hands, and so rendered him sightless. And when Chariclo asked her to restore his sight, she could not do so, but by cleansing his ears she caused him to understand every note of birds; and she gave him a staff of cornel-wood, wherewith he walked like those who see."[^apd-athena]

**3. Hera and Zeus:** "Hesiod says that he beheld snakes copulating on Cyllene, and that having wounded them he was turned from a man into a woman, but that on observing the same snakes copulating again, he became a man." When [Hera](../deities/hera.md) and [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) disputed "whether the pleasures of love are felt more by women or by men, they referred to him for a decision. He said that if the pleasures of love be reckoned at ten, men enjoy one and women nine." This answer enraged Hera, who blinded him, while Zeus bestowed the art of soothsaying.[^apd-hera]

The text preserves Tiresias's pronouncement: "Of ten parts a man enjoys one only; but a woman enjoys the full ten parts in her heart."[^apd-saying]

### The Seven Against Thebes (3.6.7)

When the Thebans sought his counsel before battle, "he said that they should be victorious if Menoeceus, son of Creon, would offer himself freely as a sacrifice to [Ares](../deities/ares.md)."[^apd-seven]

### The Epigoni and Death (3.7.3)

When the Epigoni conquered Thebes, Tiresias told the Thebans "to send a herald to treat with the Argives, and themselves to take to flight." The Thebans fled to the spring called Tilphussa, where "Tiresias drank of it and expired."[^apd-death]

His daughter Manto was sent to Delphi as part of the spoils dedicated to [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md).[^apd-manto]

## In the Odyssey

In [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) Book XI, [Odysseus](odysseus.md) sails to the land of the dead on [Circe](circe.md)'s instructions to consult Tiresias. In the underworld, Tiresias prophesies Odysseus's difficult return, [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md)'s wrath over Polyphemus, the cattle of [Helius](../deities/helius.md), the slaying of the suitors, and a final journey inland carrying an oar until someone mistakes it for a winnowing-fan.

The Bibliotheca summarises: Odysseus "offered sacrifices to the souls, and by [Circe](circe.md)'s advice consulted the soothsayer Tiresias."[^apd-odyssey]
