## Overview

**Tiresias** is the great blind seer of [Thebes](../places/thebes.md), whose gift of prophecy was compensation for his blindness. Multiple traditions explain how he lost and gained these powers, and he appears across the Theban saga and in [Odysseus](odysseus.md)'s consultation with the dead.

## In the Bibliotheca

### Blindness and Prophecy (3.6.7)

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) presents three traditions for Tiresias's blindness:

**1. Divine secrets:** "Some say that he was blinded by the gods because he revealed their secrets to men."[^apd-secrets]

**2. Athena:** "Pherecydes says that he was blinded by [Athena](../deities/athena.md); for Chariclo was dear to Athena... and Tiresias saw the goddess stark naked, and she covered his eyes with her hands, and so rendered him sightless. And when Chariclo asked her to restore his sight, she could not do so, but by cleansing his ears she caused him to understand every note of birds; and she gave him a staff of cornel-wood, wherewith he walked like those who see."[^apd-athena]

**3. Hera and Zeus:** "Hesiod says that he beheld snakes copulating on Cyllene, and that having wounded them he was turned from a man into a woman, but that on observing the same snakes copulating again, he became a man." When [Hera](../deities/hera.md) and [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) disputed "whether the pleasures of love are felt more by women or by men, they referred to him for a decision. He said that if the pleasures of love be reckoned at ten, men enjoy one and women nine." This answer enraged Hera, who blinded him, while Zeus bestowed the art of soothsaying.[^apd-hera]

The text preserves Tiresias's pronouncement: "Of ten parts a man enjoys one only; but a woman enjoys the full ten parts in her heart."[^apd-saying]

### The Seven Against Thebes (3.6.7)

When the Thebans sought his counsel before battle, "he said that they should be victorious if Menoeceus, son of Creon, would offer himself freely as a sacrifice to [Ares](../deities/ares.md)."[^apd-seven]

### The Epigoni and Death (3.7.3)

When the Epigoni conquered Thebes, Tiresias told the Thebans "to send a herald to treat with the Argives, and themselves to take to flight." The Thebans fled to the spring called Tilphussa, where "Tiresias drank of it and expired."[^apd-death]

His daughter Manto was sent to Delphi as part of the spoils dedicated to [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md).[^apd-manto]

## In the Melampodia

The Hesiodic Melampodia preserves a different version of Tiresias's sex-change pronouncement and adds details about his extraordinary lifespan:

"Father Zeus, would that you had given me a shorter span of life to be mine and wisdom of heart like that of mortal men! But now you have honoured me not even a little, though you ordained me to have a long span of life, and to live through seven generations of mortal kind."[^mel-lifespan]

The sex-change story appears with a fuller version of his judgment: "They say that Teiresias saw two snakes mating on Cithaeron and that, when he killed the female, he was changed into a woman, and again, when he killed the male, took again his own nature. This same Teiresias was chosen by Zeus and Hera to decide the question whether the male or the female has most pleasure in intercourse. And he said: 'Of ten parts a man enjoys only one; but a woman's sense enjoys all ten in full.' For this Hera was angry and blinded him, but Zeus gave him the seer's power."[^mel-snakes]

The Melampodia also records the contest of seers between Calchas and Mopsus (son of Manto, Tiresias's granddaughter) at Clarus after the Trojan War. Calchas set the riddle of counting figs on a wild fig-tree; Mopsus answered correctly ("ten thousand is their number, and their measure is a bushel: one fig is left over"), and "then did the end of death shroud Calchas."[^mel-calchas]

[^mel-lifespan]: "Father Zeus, would that you had given me a shorter span of life to be mine and wisdom of heart like that of mortal men! But now you have honoured me not even a little, though you ordained me to have a long span of life, and to live through seven generations of mortal kind" (Melampodia, Fragment 2, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^mel-snakes]: "They say that Teiresias saw two snakes mating on Cithaeron and that, when he killed the female, he was changed into a woman, and again, when he killed the male, took again his own nature... And he said: 'Of ten parts a man enjoys only one; but a woman's sense enjoys all ten in full.' For this Hera was angry and blinded him, but Zeus gave him the seer's power" (Melampodia, Fragment 3, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^mel-calchas]: "Calchas set Mopsus the following problem: 'I am filled with wonder at the quantity of figs this wild fig-tree bears though it is so small. Can you tell their number?' And Mopsus answered: 'Ten thousand is their number, and their measure is a bushel: one fig is left over, which you would not be able to put into the measure.' So said he; and they found the reckoning of the measure true. Then did the end of death shroud Calchas." (Melampodia, Fragment 1, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## In the Odyssey

In [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) Book XI, [Odysseus](odysseus.md) sails to the land of the dead on [Circe](../deities/circe.md)'s instructions to consult Tiresias. In the underworld, Tiresias prophesies Odysseus's difficult return, [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md)'s wrath over Polyphemus, the cattle of [Helius](../deities/helius.md), the slaying of the suitors, and a final journey inland carrying an oar until someone mistakes it for a winnowing-fan.

The Bibliotheca summarises: Odysseus "offered sacrifices to the souls, and by [Circe](../deities/circe.md)'s advice consulted the soothsayer Tiresias."[^apd-odyssey]

## In the Fabulae

The [Fabulae](../sources/hyginus.md) combines elements from the Hesiodic tradition with unique details about the method of transformation and Zeus's gifts.

### The Snake Transformation (§75)

"On Mount Cyllene Tiresias, son of Everes, a shepherd, is said to have struck with his staff, or trampled on, snakes which were coupling."[^hyg-75-snakes] The Fabulae gives two methods — striking or trampling — and identifies him as a shepherd.

"Because of this he was changed to a woman. Later, advised by an oracle, he trampled on the snakes in the same place, and returned to his former sex."[^hyg-75-return] The return transformation is specifically prompted by an oracle.

### The Judgment of Zeus and Hera

"At this same time there was a joking dispute between Jove and Juno as to whether man or woman derived more pleasure from the act of love. They took Tiresias as judge, since he had been both man and woman."[^hyg-75-dispute] The Fabulae characterizes it as a "joking dispute" (Latin: iocans).

"When he decided in Jove's favour, Juno with the back of her hand angrily blinded him."[^hyg-75-blind] The detail of striking "with the back of her hand" is unique to the Fabulae.

### Zeus's Compensation

"But Jove because of this gave him seven lives to live, and made him a seer wiser than other mortals."[^hyg-75-gifts] The Fabulae specifies "seven lives" rather than "seven generations" and emphasizes Tiresias as "wiser than other mortals" rather than merely possessing the art of soothsaying.

[^hyg-75-snakes]: "On Mount Cyllene Tiresias, son of Everes, a shepherd, is said to have struck with his staff, or trampled on, snakes which were coupling" (Fabulae §75, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-75-return]: "Because of this he was changed to a woman. Later, advised by an oracle, he trampled on the snakes in the same place, and returned to his former sex" (Fabulae §75, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-75-dispute]: "At this same time there was a joking dispute between Jove and Juno as to whether man or woman derived more pleasure from the act of love. They took Tiresias as judge, since he had been both man and woman" (Fabulae §75, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-75-blind]: "When he decided in Jove's favour, Juno with the back of her hand angrily blinded him" (Fabulae §75, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-75-gifts]: "Jove because of this gave him seven lives to live, and made him a seer wiser than other mortals" (Fabulae §75, trans. Mary Grant)

## In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md)

### The Sex Change and Judgment (3.316-338)

Ovid tells how [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) (Jove), "a careless hour, indulged too freely in the nectar cup" and jested with [Hera](../deities/hera.md) (Juno) that women enjoyed greater pleasure in love than men. They chose Tiresias as arbiter, "than whom none knew both male and female joys."[^met-tir-arbiter] While wandering in a wood he had struck two coupling serpents with his staff and been transformed into a woman for seven years. Upon seeing the snakes again, he struck them once more and "his former sex returned; his manhood was restored."[^met-tir-change]

When Tiresias sided with Zeus, Hera "enraged, decreed eternal night should seal Tiresias' eyes." Zeus could not undo another god's decree but compensated him with "the gift of prophecy."[^met-tir-blind]

### Prophecy of Narcissus (3.339-350)

Tiresias's fame of prophecy was proven by his first oracle. When the nymph Liriope asked if her son [Narcissus](narcissus.md) would attain old age, Tiresias answered: "If he but fail to recognize himself, a long life he may have, beneath the sun." The words "seemed frivolous" until the event confirmed them.[^met-tir-narcissus]

### Warning to Pentheus (3.509-525)

Tiresias warned Pentheus against opposing [Dionysus](../deities/dionysus.md): "Oh glad the day to thee, if, light denied, thine eyes, most fortunate, should not behold the Bacchanalian rites!" He prophesied Pentheus would be "torn asunder" by his own mother and aunts. Pentheus drove the seer away, "but all his words, prophetic, were fulfilled."[^met-tir-pentheus]

[^met-tir-arbiter]: "than whom none knew both male and female joys: for wandering in a green wood he had seen two serpents coupling; and he took his staff and sharply struck them" (Metamorphoses 3.322-326, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-tir-change]: "his former sex returned; his manhood was restored" (Metamorphoses 3.331-332, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-tir-blind]: "the disappointment Juno felt surpassed all reason, and enraged, decreed eternal night should seal Tiresias' eyes... but Jove, to recompense his loss of sight, endowed him with the gift of prophecy" (Metamorphoses 3.336-340, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-tir-narcissus]: "If he but fail to recognize himself, a long life he may have, beneath the sun" (Metamorphoses 3.348, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-tir-pentheus]: "Oh glad the day to thee, if, light denied, thine eyes, most fortunate, should not behold the Bacchanalian rites! The day will come, and soon the light will dawn, when Bacchus, born of Semele, shall make his advent known" (Metamorphoses 3.513-518, trans. Brookes More)

## In Euripides' Bacchae

In the [Bacchae](../sources/euripides-bacchae.md), Tiresias defends [Dionysus](../deities/dionysus.md)'s divinity with a theological speech that is the play's intellectual centerpiece. He arrives dressed for worship — "to twine the thyrsi, and to put on the skins of deer, and to crown the head with ivy branches" — despite his blindness and old age.[^eur-bac-dress]

### Theology of Dionysus

Tiresias argues that Dionysus is one of two primary powers: "Two things are first among men; Ceres, the goddess... She nourishes mortals with dry food; but he who is come as a match to her, the son of Semele, has invented the liquid drink of the grape."[^eur-bac-two] Wine "delivers miserable mortals from grief" and "gives sleep an oblivion of daily evils: nor is there any other medicine for troubles."[^eur-bac-wine]

He claims Dionysus has prophetic power — "Bacchanal excitement and frenzy have much divination in them" — and shares qualities of [Ares](../deities/ares.md): "terror flutters sometimes an army under arms and in its ranks, before they touch the spear; and this also is a frenzy from Bacchus."[^eur-bac-ares-tir]

### Warning to Pentheus

Tiresias warns [Pentheus](pentheus.md): "do not boast that sovereignty has power among men" and "receive the God into the land, and sacrifice to him." He defends the Bacchants' morality: "Bacchus will not compel women to be modest with regard to Venus, but in his nature modesty in all things is ever innate."[^eur-bac-modesty] After Pentheus refuses, Tiresias departs saying "you rave most grievously; nor can you procure any cure from medicine."[^eur-bac-rave]

[^eur-bac-dress]: "to twine the thyrsi, and to put on the skins of deer, and to crown the head with ivy branches" (Bacchae 176-177, trans. T.A. Buckley)
[^eur-bac-two]: "Two things are first among men; Ceres, the goddess... She nourishes mortals with dry food; but he who is come as a match to her, the son of Semele, has invented the liquid drink of the grape, and introduced it among mortals, which delivers miserable mortals from grief" (Bacchae 274-280, trans. T.A. Buckley)
[^eur-bac-wine]: "gives sleep an oblivion of daily evils: nor is there any other medicine for troubles" (Bacchae 281-283, trans. T.A. Buckley)
[^eur-bac-ares-tir]: "he also possesses some quality of Mars; for terror flutters sometimes an army under arms and in its ranks, before they touch the spear; and this also is a frenzy from Bacchus" (Bacchae 302-305, trans. T.A. Buckley)
[^eur-bac-modesty]: "Bacchus will not compel women to be modest with regard to Venus, but in his nature modesty in all things is ever innate" (Bacchae 314-317, trans. T.A. Buckley)
[^eur-bac-rave]: "you rave most grievously; nor can you procure any cure from medicine" (Bacchae 326-327, trans. T.A. Buckley)
