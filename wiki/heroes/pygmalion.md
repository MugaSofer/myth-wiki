## Overview

**Pygmalion** is a Cypriot sculptor who, disgusted by the conduct of the Propoetides, carved an ivory statue of surpassing beauty and fell in love with his own creation. [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md), moved by his devotion, brought the statue to life.

## In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md)

### The Statue (10.243-269)

Pygmalion "lived in preference, for many years unmarried" after seeing the Propoetides waste their lives in shame. "With consummate skill, he carved a statue out of snow-white ivory, and gave to it exquisite beauty, which no woman of the world has ever equalled: she was so beautiful, he fell in love with his creation."[^met-pygmalion-carve]

His devotion was extraordinary: he kissed the statue, brought it gifts of "smooth round pebbles, shells, and birds, and fragrant flowers," dressed it in rich clothing, laid it on a bed "spread with coverlets of Tyrian purple dye," and named it "the consort of his couch."[^met-pygmalion-gifts]

### The Prayer to Aphrodite (10.270-297)

At the festival of [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md) in Cyprus, Pygmalion prayed at the altar: "If it is true, O Gods, that you can give all things, I pray to have as my wife" — but he dared not say "my ivory statue-maid," and instead said "one like my ivory." Aphrodite, present at her festival, "knew clearly what the prayer had meant. She gave a sign that her Divinity favoured his plea: three times the flame leaped high."[^met-pygmalion-prayer]

When he returned and kissed the statue, "she seemed to gather some warmth from his lips." He touched her breast: "the ivory seemed to soften at the touch, and its firm texture yielded to his hand, as honey-wax of Mount Hymettus turns to many shapes when handled in the sun." Then "the maiden felt the kisses given to her, and blushing, lifted up her timid eyes, so that she saw the light and sky above, as well as her rapt lover."[^met-pygmalion-life]

Aphrodite graced the marriage, and "when nine times a crescent moon had changed, increasing to the full, the statue-bride gave birth to her dear daughter Paphos."[^met-pygmalion-paphos]
