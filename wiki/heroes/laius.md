## Overview

**Laius** was king of [Thebes](../places/thebes.md), son of Labdacus, and husband of [Jocasta](../heroes/jocasta.md). An oracle warned him that any son he begot would kill him. He exposed the infant who would become [Oedipus](../heroes/oedipus.md) on Mount Cithaeron, but the child survived and later killed him at a crossroads in Phocis — fulfilling the prophecy. Laius is dead before any surviving play begins, but his oracle, his murder, and the circumstances of his son's birth drive the plot of Sophocles' Oedipus the King throughout.

## In the Bibliotheca

The Bibliotheca traces the Theban royal line: Labdacus, "having died while Oedipus was still a child," left Laius as his heir (3.5.5).[^apd-labdacus] An oracle warned Laius that the child born to him by Jocasta "would kill his father." Despite the warning — the Bibliotheca notes that Laius "being drunk, had intercourse with his wife" — a son was born.[^apd-oracle] Laius pierced the infant's ankles with brooches and gave it to a herdsman to expose on [Cithaeron](../places/cithaeron.md).

The infant survived, was found by Corinthian herdsmen, and raised by King Polybus as [Oedipus](../heroes/oedipus.md). Laius was later killed when Oedipus encountered him on the road from Delphi through Phocis: Laius's herald Polyphontes ordered Oedipus to make way, killed one of his horses, and Oedipus in rage killed both Polyphontes and Laius.[^apd-death]

## In the Fabulae

Hyginus's account begins: "The oracle of Apollo warned Laius, son of Labdacus, that he should beware of death at his son's hands, and so when his wife Jocasta bore a son, he ordered him to be exposed."[^hyg-oracle] The child's feet were pierced, giving him the name Oedipus.

In the Fabulae version of the parricide, Oedipus was on his way to Delphi when the meeting occurred: "when servants bade him give way to the King, he refused. The King urged on his horses, and a wheel grazed Oidipus' foot. Enraged, he dragged his father from the chariot, not knowing who he was, and killed him."[^hyg-death]

## In Sophocles' Oedipus the King

Laius is dead before the play opens, but the entire plot turns on discovering his murderer. [Creon](../heroes/creon.md) returns from Delphi with Apollo's pronouncement: the plague on Thebes is caused by the unpunished murder of Laius, and "the assassins of the king" must be "banished or atoned for" by blood.[^sot-oracle]

[Jocasta](../heroes/jocasta.md) is the primary witness. She describes the oracle given to Laius: "An oracle / Once came to Laius... / declaring he was doomed / To perish by the hand of his own son, / A child that should be born to him by me."[^sot-jocasta] She also recounts Laius's death: "he was murdered on a day by highwaymen, / No natives, at a spot where three roads meet" in Phocis — specifically where "Branch roads from Delphi and from Daulis meet."[^sot-crossroads] She adds that Laius was "but three days old" when he exposed the infant, having had its "ankles pierced and pinned / Together."[^sot-exposure]

Oedipus asks about Laius's physical appearance. Jocasta replies: "Tall was he, and his hair was lightly strewn / With silver; and not unlike thee in form."[^sot-appearance] This is the only physical description of Laius in the surviving sources.

The old herdsman later confirms he received the infant from Laius and Jocasta and was charged with exposing it, but spared the child "for it was foretold that he should slay his sire."[^sot-herdsman]

## In Sophocles' Oedipus at Colonus

Oedipus, defending himself against [Creon](../heroes/creon.md)'s accusations, argues that the killing of his father was unintentional: "if by some oracle / My sire was destined to a bloody end / By a son's hand, can this reflect on me, / Me then unborn... And if... / I met my sire, not knowing whom I met / or what I did, and slew him, how canst thou / With justice blame the all-unconscious hand?"[^soc-defense]
