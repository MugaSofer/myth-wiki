## Overview

**Orestes** is the son of [Agamemnon](agamemnon.md) and Clytaemnestra who avenged his father's murder by killing his own mother and her lover Aegisthus. Driven mad by the Furies for this act of matricide, he was tried at the Areopagus in Athens and acquitted. He later journeyed to the land of the Taurians to retrieve a sacred wooden image, where he was reunited with his sister Iphigenia, who served as priestess there.

## In the Bibliotheca

### The Murder of Agamemnon (E.6.23)

When [Agamemnon](agamemnon.md) returned to Mycenae with Cassandra after the Trojan War, "he was murdered by Aegisthus and Clytaemnestra; for she gave him a shirt without sleeves and without a neck, and while he was putting it on he was cut down, and Aegisthus reigned over Mycenae. And they killed Cassandra also."[^apd-murder]

### The Smuggling of Orestes (E.6.24)

"Electra, one of Agamemnon's daughters, smuggled away her brother Orestes and gave him to Strophius, the Phocian, to bring up; and he brought him up with Pylades, his own son."[^apd-smuggled] When Orestes reached maturity, "he repaired to Delphi and asked the god whether he should take vengeance on his father's murderers."[^apd-delphi]

### The Matricide and Trial (E.6.25)

[Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) "gave him leave, so he departed secretly to Mycenae in company with Pylades, and killed both his mother and Aegisthus."[^apd-vengeance] The consequence was swift and terrible: "not long afterwards, being afflicted with madness and pursued by the Furies, he repaired to Athens and was tried in the Areopagus."[^apd-madness]

The accounts of who brought him to trial vary — "he is variously said to have been brought to trial by the Furies, or by Tyndareus, or by Erigone, daughter of Aegisthus and Clytaemnestra" — but the outcome was clear: "the votes at his trial being equal he was acquitted."[^apd-trial]

### The Journey to Tauris (E.6.26-27)

Even after his acquittal, Orestes was not free of his affliction. "When he inquired how he should be rid of his disorder, the god answered that he would be rid of it if he should fetch the wooden image that was in the land of the Taurians."[^apd-cure] This was no simple task, for "the Taurians are a part of the Scythians, who murder strangers and throw them into the sacred fire."[^apd-taurians]

Undaunted, Orestes traveled there with his companion Pylades. "When Orestes was come with Pylades to the land of the Taurians, he was detected, caught, and carried in bonds before Thoas the king, who sent them both to the priestess."[^apd-captured] The priestess was none other than his sister Iphigenia, whom [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md) had spirited away from Aulis years before. "Being recognized by his sister, who acted as priestess among the Taurians, he fled with her, carrying off the wooden image. It was conveyed to Athens and is now called the image of Tauropolus."[^apd-escape]

### Marriage and Death (E.6.28, E.6.14)

After his return, Orestes "came to Mycenae" and "united his sister Electra in marriage to Pylades."[^apd-marriage] As for his own marriage, he took Hermione as his wife, though the circumstances were complicated. Hermione "had previously been betrothed to" Neoptolemus "in Troy," and when Orestes "went mad, Neoptolemus carried off his wife Hermione." In revenge, Orestes slew Neoptolemus "at Delphi."[^apd-neoptolemus]

Orestes fathered a son, Tisamenus, and ultimately met his end far from the glories of Mycenae: he "was killed by the bite of a snake at Oresteum in Arcadia."[^apd-death]

## In the Fabulae

### The Revenge (§119)

The Fabulae narrates Orestes' revenge with elaborate deception. "When Orestes, son of [Agamemnon](agamemnon.md) and Clytemnestra, grew to manhood, he desired to avenge his father's death. And so he made a plan with Pylades and came to Mycenae to his mother Clytemnestra, saying that Orestes, who Aegisthus had turned over to the people to be killed, was dead, and that he was an Aitolian guest-friend."[^hyg119-plan]

The deception continued: "Not long after this, Pylades, son of Strophius, came to Clytemnestra bringing an urn which he said contained the bones of Orestes. Aegisthus rejoiced and welcomed them both hospitably."[^hyg119-urn] Then "When an opportunity came, Orestes with help of Pylades by night slew Clytemnestra, his mother, and Aegisthus."[^hyg119-murder]

The aftermath differed from Apollodorus: "When Tyndareus accused him, Orestes was allowed to go into exile by the people of Mycenae because of his father. Later the Furies of his mother pursued him."[^hyg119-exile]

[^hyg119-plan]: "When Orestes, son of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra, grew to manhood, he desired to avenge his father's death. And so he made a plan with Pylades and came to Mycenae to his mother Clytemnestra, saying that Orestes, who Aegisthus had turned over to the people to be killed, was dead, and that he was an Aitolian guest-friend" (Fabulae §119, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg119-urn]: "Not long after this, Pylades, son of Strophius, came to Clytemnestra bringing an urn which he said contained the bones of Orestes. Aegisthus rejoiced and welcomed them both hospitably" (Fabulae §119, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg119-murder]: "When an opportunity came, Orestes with help of Pylades by night slew Clytemnestra, his mother, and Aegisthus" (Fabulae §119, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg119-exile]: "When Tyndareus accused him, Orestes was allowed to go into exile by the people of Mycenae because of his father. Later the Furies of his mother pursued him" (Fabulae §119, trans. Mary Grant)

### Iphigenia in Taurica (§120)

In Hyginus's account, Orestes "went to Delphi to inquire when his sufferings would end. The reply was that he should go to the land of Taurica to King Thoas, father of Hypsipyle, and bring to Argos from the temple there the statue of [Diana](../deities/artemis.md); then there would be an end to his sufferings."[^hyg120-oracle]

The custom of the Taurians: "It was their custom to sacrifice at the temple of Diana whatever stranger came within their borders."[^hyg120-custom] Orestes and Pylades "were hiding in a cave waiting an opportunity" when "they were seized by shepherds and brought to King Thoas. Thoas, as was his custom, ordered them to be brought bound into the temple of Diana to be sacrificed."[^hyg120-seized]

Iphigenia's recognition and escape plan: "The priestess there was Iphigenia, sister of Orestes, and when by tokens and questioning she found out who they were and why they had come, she herself, casting aside the vessels for sacrifice, started to remove the statue of Diana."[^hyg120-recognition] She deceived Thoas: "When the king came up and asked her why she was doing this, she made pretence and said that since the men were accursed they had defiled the statue; because impious and wicked men had been brought into the temple, the statue should be taken to the sea for cleansing. She bade him make a proclamation forbidding citizens to go outside the city."[^hyg120-pretense]

The escape: "Iphigenia, seizing the opportunity, took the statue, embarked with Orestes and Pylades, and by a favouring breeze was borne to the island Zminthe to Chryses, priest of [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md)."[^hyg120-escape]

[^hyg120-oracle]: "When the Furies were pursuing Orestes, he went to Delphi to inquire when his sufferings would end. The reply was that he should go to the land of Taurica to King Thoas, father of Hypsipyle, and bring to Argos from the temple there the statue of Diana; then there would be an end to his sufferings" (Fabulae §120, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg120-custom]: "Upon hearing this oracle, along with Pylades his companion, son of Strophius, he embarked and quickly came to the land of the Taurians. It was their custom to sacrifice at the temple of Diana whatever stranger came within their borders" (Fabulae §120, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg120-seized]: "When Orestes and Pylades were hiding in a cave waiting an opportunity, they were seized by shepherds and brought to King Thoas. Thoas, as was his custom, ordered them to be brought bound into the temple of Diana to be sacrificed" (Fabulae §120, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg120-recognition]: "The priestess there was Iphigenia, sister of Orestes, and when by tokens and questioning she found out who they were and why they had come, she herself, casting aside the vessels for sacrifice, started to remove the statue of Diana" (Fabulae §120, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg120-pretense]: "When the king came up and asked her why she was doing this, she made pretence and said that since the men were accursed they had defiled the statue; because impious and wicked men had been brought into the temple, the statue should be taken to the sea for cleansing. She bade him make a proclamation forbidding citizens to go outside the city" (Fabulae §120, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg120-escape]: "The king complied with the words of the priestess. Iphigenia, seizing the opportunity, took the statue, embarked with Orestes and Pylades, and by a favouring breeze was borne to the island Zminthe to Chryses, priest of Apollo" (Fabulae §120, trans. Mary Grant)

### Chryses and Aletes (§121-122)

The Fabulae preserves a unique tradition about Chryses. When [Agamemnon](agamemnon.md) sent back Chryseis (pregnant), "she bore Chryses the Younger, and said she had conceived by [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md)."[^hyg121-birth] When Orestes and Iphigenia arrived, "Chryses was about to return Iphigenia and Orestes to Thoas" but "he [Chryses the Elder] learned that they were children of Agamemnon, and revealed to Chryses his [grand]son the truth — that they were brothers and that he was a son of Agamemnon. Then Chryses, thus informed, with Orestes his brother, killed Thoas."[^hyg121-reveal]

A separate false report about Orestes' death reached Electra: "To Electra, daughter of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra, a messenger came, falsely saying that her brother and Pylades had been sacrificed in Taurica to Diana."[^hyg122-false] When Aletes (son of Aegisthus) seized power, "Electra went to Delphi to inquire about her brother's violent death. She came the same day that Iphigenia and Orestes arrived."[^hyg122-delphi]

In ignorance, Electra nearly blinded Iphigenia: "The same messenger who had reported about Orestes, said that Iphigenia was the murderess of her brother. When Electra heard this, she seized a burning firebrand from the altar, and in her ignorance would have blinded her sister Iphigenia if Orestes had not intervened."[^hyg122-firebrand]

After recognition, "Orestes killed Aletes, son of Aegisthus, and would have killed Erigone, daughter of Clytemnestra and Aegisthus, but Diana rescued her and made her a priestess in the Attic land."[^hyg122-aletes]

[^hyg121-birth]: "When Agamemnon was on his way to Troy, Achilles, too, came to Moesia, and took Chryseis, daughter of the priest of Apollo, and gave her in marriage to Agamemnon. When Chryses came to Agamemnon to beg him to return his daughter, he was refused... And so Agamemnon sent back Chryseis, though she was pregnant, to the priest... when her time came she bore Chryses the Younger, and said she had conceived by Apollo" (Fabulae §121, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg121-reveal]: "Later when Chryses was about to return Iphigenia and Orestes to Thoas, he [Chryses the Elder] learned that they were children of Agamemnon, and revealed to Chryses his [grand]son the truth — that they were brothers and that he was a son of Agamemnon. Then Chryses, thus informed, with Orestes his brother, killed Thoas, and from there they came safe to Mycenae with the statue of Diana" (Fabulae §121, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg122-false]: "To Electra, daughter of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra, a messenger came, falsely saying that her brother and Pylades had been sacrificed in Taurica to Diana" (Fabulae §122, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg122-delphi]: "When Aletes, Aegisthus' son, heard that no-one of the race of the Atreidae survived, he seized the kingly power in Mycenae. But Electra went to Delphi to inquire about her brother's violent death. She came the same day that Iphigenia and Orestes arrived" (Fabulae §122, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg122-firebrand]: "The same messenger who had reported about Orestes, said that Iphigenia was the murderess of her brother. When Electra heard this, she seized a burning firebrand from the altar, and in her ignorance would have blinded her sister Iphigenia if Orestes had not intervened" (Fabulae §122, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg122-aletes]: "After this recognition they came to Mycenae, and Orestes killed Aletes, son of Aegisthus, and would have killed Erigone, daughter of Clytemnestra and Aegisthus, but Diana rescued her and made her a priestess in the Attic land" (Fabulae §122, trans. Mary Grant)

## In [Pindar](../sources/pindar.md)

### The Murder of Agamemnon at Amyklai (Pythian XI)

Pindar's Pythian XI presents the story of Orestes with several significant differences from other accounts. The murder of [Agamemnon](agamemnon.md) is located at Amyklai, not Mycenae or Argos: "the hero himself, the son of Atreus, when after long time he came unto famous Amyklai, and drew down with him to death the maiden prophetess" — meaning Kassandra.[^pin-amyklai]

### Arsinoë as Rescuer (Pythian XI)

Crucially, Pindar names the one who saved infant Orestes not as Electra but as a nurse named Arsinoë: "Orestes, on the murder of his father, Arsinoë his nurse saved from the violent hands of Klytaimnestra and out of the ruinous treason."[^pin-arsinoe] This stands in contrast to [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) E.6.24, where Electra rescues him, and to [Fabulae](../sources/hyginus.md) §117, where Electra sends him to Strophius.

### Clytemnestra's Motives Questioned (Pythian XI)

Pindar raises two possible motives for Klytaimnestra's actions, without choosing between them: "Did then the slaughter of Iphigenia far from her own land on Euripos' shore so sting her mother to the arousal of a wrath of grievous act? Or had nocturnal loves misguided her, in thraldom to a paramour's embrace?"[^pin-motives] This double question is rare — the sources usually present Iphigenia's sacrifice as the primary motivation.

### Orestes at Parnassos and the Vengeance (Pythian XI)

Orestes came "and was the guest of the old man Strophios, who dwelt at the foot of Parnassos: but with long-tarrying sword he slew his mother, and left Aigisthos' body in its blood."[^pin-vengeance]

[^pin-amyklai]: "Thus died the hero himself, the son of Atreus, when after long time he came unto famous Amyklai, and drew down with him to death the maiden prophetess" (Pindar, Pythian XI, trans. Ernest Myers)
[^pin-arsinoe]: "Orestes, on the murder of his father, Arsinoë his nurse saved from the violent hands of Klytaimnestra and out of the ruinous treason" (Pindar, Pythian XI, trans. Ernest Myers)
[^pin-motives]: "Did then the slaughter of Iphigenia far from her own land on Euripos' shore so sting her mother to the arousal of a wrath of grievous act? Or had nocturnal loves misguided her, in thraldom to a paramour's embrace?" (Pindar, Pythian XI, trans. Ernest Myers)
[^pin-vengeance]: "Orestes, in the tenderness of his youth, came and was the guest of the old man Strophios, who dwelt at the foot of Parnassos: but with long-tarrying sword he slew his mother, and left Aigisthos' body in its blood" (Pindar, Pythian XI, trans. Ernest Myers)

## Variant Traditions

The sources give different accounts for who rescued the infant Orestes. The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) (E.6.24) credits Electra; the [Fabulae](../sources/hyginus.md) (§117) credits Electra; Pindar's Pythian XI credits a nurse named Arsinoë.

The location of Agamemnon's murder also varies. Most sources place it at Mycenae. Pindar (Pythian XI) names Amyklai — a town in Lacedaemon — instead.
