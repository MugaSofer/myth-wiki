## Overview

**Orestes** is the son of [Agamemnon](agamemnon.md) and Clytaemnestra who avenged his father's murder by killing his own mother and her lover Aegisthus. Driven mad by the Furies for this act of matricide, he was tried at the Areopagus in Athens and acquitted. He later journeyed to the land of the Taurians to retrieve a sacred wooden image, where he was reunited with his sister Iphigenia, who served as priestess there.

## In the Bibliotheca

### The Murder of Agamemnon (E.6.23)

When [Agamemnon](agamemnon.md) returned to Mycenae with Cassandra after the Trojan War, "he was murdered by Aegisthus and Clytaemnestra; for she gave him a shirt without sleeves and without a neck, and while he was putting it on he was cut down, and Aegisthus reigned over Mycenae. And they killed Cassandra also."[^apd-murder]

### The Smuggling of Orestes (E.6.24)

"Electra, one of Agamemnon's daughters, smuggled away her brother Orestes and gave him to Strophius, the Phocian, to bring up; and he brought him up with Pylades, his own son."[^apd-smuggled] When Orestes reached maturity, "he repaired to Delphi and asked the god whether he should take vengeance on his father's murderers."[^apd-delphi]

### The Matricide and Trial (E.6.25)

[Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) "gave him leave, so he departed secretly to Mycenae in company with Pylades, and killed both his mother and Aegisthus."[^apd-vengeance] The consequence was swift and terrible: "not long afterwards, being afflicted with madness and pursued by the Furies, he repaired to Athens and was tried in the Areopagus."[^apd-madness]

The accounts of who brought him to trial vary — "he is variously said to have been brought to trial by the Furies, or by Tyndareus, or by Erigone, daughter of Aegisthus and Clytaemnestra" — but the outcome was clear: "the votes at his trial being equal he was acquitted."[^apd-trial]

### The Journey to Tauris (E.6.26-27)

Even after his acquittal, Orestes was not free of his affliction. "When he inquired how he should be rid of his disorder, the god answered that he would be rid of it if he should fetch the wooden image that was in the land of the Taurians."[^apd-cure] This was no simple task, for "the Taurians are a part of the Scythians, who murder strangers and throw them into the sacred fire."[^apd-taurians]

Undaunted, Orestes traveled there with his companion Pylades. "When Orestes was come with Pylades to the land of the Taurians, he was detected, caught, and carried in bonds before Thoas the king, who sent them both to the priestess."[^apd-captured] The priestess was none other than his sister Iphigenia, whom [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md) had spirited away from Aulis years before. "Being recognized by his sister, who acted as priestess among the Taurians, he fled with her, carrying off the wooden image. It was conveyed to Athens and is now called the image of Tauropolus."[^apd-escape]

### Marriage and Death (E.6.28, E.6.14)

After his return, Orestes "came to Mycenae" and "united his sister Electra in marriage to Pylades."[^apd-marriage] As for his own marriage, he took Hermione as his wife, though the circumstances were complicated. Hermione "had previously been betrothed to" Neoptolemus "in Troy," and when Orestes "went mad, Neoptolemus carried off his wife Hermione." In revenge, Orestes slew Neoptolemus "at Delphi."[^apd-neoptolemus]

Orestes fathered a son, Tisamenus, and ultimately met his end far from the glories of Mycenae: he "was killed by the bite of a snake at Oresteum in Arcadia."[^apd-death]
