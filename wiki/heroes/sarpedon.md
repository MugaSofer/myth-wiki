## Overview

**Sarpedon** was a prince of Lycia, son of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) by Laodamia, and the most prominent of Troy's allies in the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md). His death at the hands of [Patroclus](patroclus.md) in Book XVI provokes one of the poem's most profound theological moments: Zeus, watching his own son's fate approach, considers rescuing him, only to be dissuaded by [Hera](../deities/hera.md). The scene defines the limits of divine power against fate. After Sarpedon's death, Zeus sends [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) to cleanse his body and has Sleep and Death carry him home to Lycia for burial.

## Genealogy

In the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md), Sarpedon's genealogy is given through [Bellerophon](bellerophon.md): "With Laodameia lay Zeus the lord of counsel, and she bare godlike Sarpedon, the warrior with arms of bronze."[^il6-genealogy]

[Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) confirms this but notes a separate, older Sarpedon — a son of Zeus and [Europa](europa.md), brother of [Minos](minos.md), who "allied himself with Cilix, who was at war with the Lycians, and having stipulated for a share of the country, he became king of Lycia. And Zeus granted him to live for three generations."[^apd-cretan] The Iliad Sarpedon, grandson of Bellerophon, is the one who fights at Troy.

[^il6-genealogy]: "With Laodameia lay Zeus the lord of counsel, and she bare godlike Sarpedon, the warrior with arms of bronze" (Iliad 6.198-199, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^apd-cretan]: "Sarpedon allied himself with Cilix, who was at war with the Lycians, and having stipulated for a share of the country, he became king of Lycia. And Zeus granted him to live for three generations" (Bibliotheca 3.1.2, trans. J.G. Frazer)

## In the Iliad

### The Catalogue and Early Battles

Sarpedon and Glaucus "led the Lykians from far away in Lykia by eddying Xanthos."[^il2-catalogue] He is consistently presented as the foremost Trojan ally, second only to [Hector](hector.md) among Troy's defenders.

In Book V, Sarpedon fights Tlepolemos, son of [Heracles](heracles.md) — a duel between the son and grandson of Zeus. Tlepolemos taunts him: "Falsely do men say that thou art offspring of aegis-bearing Zeus, seeing thou art found lacking greatly beside those men that in days of old were born of Zeus." Sarpedon replies by recounting Heracles' sack of Troy and promising death. Both cast their spears simultaneously: Sarpedon kills Tlepolemos, but is himself wounded in the left thigh. "His father yet warded off destruction" — Zeus protects him from death.[^il5-tlepolemos]

[^il2-catalogue]: "Sarpedon and blameless Glaukos led the Lykians from far away in Lykia by eddying Xanthos" (Iliad 2.876, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il5-tlepolemos]: "Sarpedon smote the midst of his neck, and the grievous point past right through, and the darkness of night fell on his eyes... and Tlepolemos with long spear smote the other's left thigh, and the point sped through furiously, grazing the bone; but his father yet warded off destruction" (Iliad 5.656-662, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

### The Speech on Honour (Book XII)

Sarpedon's speech to Glaucus before assaulting the Greek wall is one of the Iliad's most famous passages on the heroic code. He asks why they receive the chief honours in Lycia — "seats of honour, and messes, and full cups" and "a great demesne by the banks of Xanthos, a fair demesne of vineyards and tilth" — and answers: because they are expected to "stand in the front of the Lykians and encounter the scorching battle." The speech concludes with a meditation on mortality:

> "Man, could we but by escaping this war live for ever ageless and immortal, I too would not fight in the foremost ranks, nor would I send thee into the war that gives men glory. But now — for myriad fates of death do every way beset us, and these no mortal may escape nor avoid — now let us go forward."[^il12-speech]

He then charges the wall "like a lion against the kine of crooked horn" and tears apart the battlements with his bare hands, breaching the Greek defences.[^il12-wall]

[^il12-speech]: "Glaukos, wherefore have we twain the chiefest honour,—seats of honour, and messes, and full cups in Lykia, and all men look on us as gods? And wherefore hold we a great demesne by the banks of Xanthos... Man, could we but by escaping this war live for ever ageless and immortal, I too would not fight in the foremost ranks... But now — for myriad fates of death do every way beset us, and these no mortal may escape nor avoid — now let us go forward" (Iliad 12.310-328, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il12-wall]: "Sarpedon seized with strong hands the battlement, and dragged, and it all gave way together, while above the wall was stripped bare, and made a path for many" (Iliad 12.397-399, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

### Zeus's Grief and Sarpedon's Death (Book XVI)

When [Patroclus](patroclus.md) drives the Trojans back, Sarpedon rallies the Lycians and challenges him. Zeus, watching, is torn: "in two ways my heart within my breast is divided, as I ponder whether I should catch him up alive out of the tearful war, and set him down in the rich land of Lykia, or whether I should now subdue him beneath the hands of the son of Menoitios."[^il16-zeus]

[Hera](../deities/hera.md) warns him against intervening: "A mortal man long doomed to fate dost thou desire to deliver again from death of evil name?" She argues that other gods would then save their own sons, overturning fate itself. "But if he be dear to thee, and thy heart mourns for him, truly then suffer him to be subdued... send Death and sweet Sleep to bear him, even till they come to the land of wide Lykia, there will his kindred and friends bury him, with a barrow and a pillar, for this is the due of the dead."[^il16-hera]

Zeus yields, but "shed bloody raindrops on the earth, honouring his dear son."[^il16-rain]

In the duel, Sarpedon misses twice. Patroclus strikes him "even where the midriff clasps the beating heart. And he fell as falls an oak, or a silver poplar, or a slim pine tree, that on the hills the shipwrights fell with whetted axes, to be timber for ship-building; even so before the horses and chariot he lay at length, moaning aloud, and clutching at the bloody dust."[^il16-death]

Dying, Sarpedon calls to Glaucus: "Dear Glaukos, warrior among warlike men, now most doth it behove thee to be a spearman, and a hardy fighter... fight for Sarpedon." His last words are of honour: "to thee even in time to come shall I be shame and disgrace for ever, all thy days, if the Achaians strip me of mine armour." Then "the end of death veiled over his eyes and his nostrils, but Patroklos, setting foot on his breast drew the spear out of his flesh, and the midriff followed with the spear, so that he drew forth together the spear point, and the soul of Sarpedon."[^il16-last-words]

[^il16-zeus]: "Ah woe is me for that it is fated that Sarpedon, the best-beloved of men to me, shall be subdued under Patroklos... in two ways my heart within my breast is divided, as I ponder whether I should catch him up alive out of the tearful war, and set him down in the rich land of Lykia" (Iliad 16.433-438, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il16-hera]: "A mortal man long doomed to fate dost thou desire to deliver again from death of evil name?... send Death and sweet Sleep to bear him, even till they come to the land of wide Lykia, there will his kindred and friends bury him, with a barrow and a pillar, for this is the due of the dead" (Iliad 16.441-457, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il16-rain]: "he shed bloody raindrops on the earth, honouring his dear son, that Patroklos was about to slay in the deep-soiled land of Troia, far off from his own country" (Iliad 16.459-461, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il16-death]: "his javelin flew not vainly from his hand, but struck Sarpedon even where the midriff clasps the beating heart. And he fell as falls an oak, or a silver poplar, or a slim pine tree, that on the hills the shipwrights fell with whetted axes" (Iliad 16.479-483, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il16-last-words]: "Dear Glaukos, warrior among warlike men, now most doth it behove thee to be a spearman... the end of death veiled over his eyes and his nostrils, but Patroklos, setting foot on his breast drew the spear out of his flesh, and the midriff followed with the spear, so that he drew forth together the spear point, and the soul of Sarpedon" (Iliad 16.492-505, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

### Sleep and Death Carry the Body Home

After the battle over Sarpedon's corpse, Zeus commands [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) to tend to his son: "take Sarpedon out of range of darts, and cleanse the black blood from him, and thereafter bear him far away, and bathe him in the streams of the river, and anoint him with ambrosia, and clothe him in garments that wax not old, and send him to be wafted by fleet convoy, by the twin brethren Sleep and Death, that quickly will set him in the rich land of wide Lykia. There will his kinsmen and clansmen give him burial, with barrow and pillar, for such is the due of the dead."[^il16-sleep-death]

[^il16-sleep-death]: "take Sarpedon out of range of darts, and cleanse the black blood from him... and send him to be wafted by fleet convoy, by the twin brethren Sleep and Death, that quickly will set him in the rich land of wide Lykia. There will his kinsmen and clansmen give him burial, with barrow and pillar, for such is the due of the dead" (Iliad 16.667-675, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

## Variant Traditions

Two figures named Sarpedon appear in the sources:

1. **Sarpedon son of Zeus and Europa** ([Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) 3.1.1-2): Brother of [Minos](minos.md) and Rhadamanthys. Quarrelled with Minos over a boy named Miletus, fled to Lycia, and became its king. Zeus "granted him to live for three generations."
2. **Sarpedon son of Zeus and Laodamia** ([Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) 6.198-199): Grandson of [Bellerophon](bellerophon.md). The Sarpedon who fights and dies at Troy.

Apollodorus notes both. The three-generation lifespan granted to the Cretan Sarpedon may represent an ancient attempt to reconcile these two into one figure.
