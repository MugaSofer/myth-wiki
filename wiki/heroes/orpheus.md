## Overview

**Orpheus** is the greatest musician of Greek mythology, whose song could charm animals, trees, and even stones. His descent to the underworld to retrieve his dead wife Eurydice, and his tragic failure at the moment of return, is one of the most celebrated myths of antiquity. He was later torn apart by Thracian maenads.

## In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md)

### Orpheus and Eurydice (10.1-77)

After Eurydice died from a serpent's bite, Orpheus descended to the underworld to plead for her return. He sang before [Persephone](../deities/persephone.md) and [Hades](../deities/hades.md), and his music moved even the tormented shades: "the bloodless ghosts themselves were weeping, and the anxious Tantalus stopped clutching at return-flow of the wave, Ixion's twisting wheel stood wonder-bound."[^met-orpheus-ghosts]

The rulers of the underworld consented: Eurydice was called forth "among the new-arriving shades, and she obeyed the call by walking to them with slow steps, yet halting from her wound." But Orpheus was told he must not look back. Near the surface, "in fear he might again lose her, and anxious for another look at her, he turned his eyes so he could gaze upon her. Instantly she slipped away."[^met-orpheus-look] Eurydice spoke only one word: "Farewell!"[^met-orpheus-farewell]

Orpheus sat seven days on the banks of the Styx, "in squalid misery and without all food." He then withdrew to Rhodope and for three years shunned the company of women.[^met-orpheus-grief]

### Songs of Orpheus (10.143-739)

Sitting on a hilltop, Orpheus sang and drew the very trees around him to provide shade. His songs within the poem form a nested narrative, including the tales of Ganymede, Hyacinthus, [Pygmalion](pygmalion.md), Myrrha, Adonis, and [Atalanta](atalanta.md)'s race.

### Death of Orpheus (11.1-66)

The Ciconian maenads, enraged that Orpheus had scorned their love, attacked him. At first his music held power: a stone hurled at him "was overpowered by the true harmony of his voice and lyre, and so disabled lay before his feet."[^met-orpheus-stone] But the maenads' noise — "the clamorous discord of their boxwood pipes, the blaring of their horns, their tambourines and clapping hands and Bacchanalian yells" — drowned out his song. Then "the stones that heard his song no more fell crimson with the Thracian poet's blood."[^met-orpheus-drowned]

They tore him apart: "through those same lips which had controlled the rocks and which had overcome ferocious beasts, his life breathed forth, departed in the air."[^met-orpheus-death] His severed head and lyre floated down the Hebrus to Lesbos, where [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) saved the head from a serpent by turning it to stone.

### Reunion in the Underworld (11.61-66)

In death, Orpheus found what he could not achieve in life: "remembering now those regions that he saw when there before, he sought Eurydice through fields frequented by the blest; and when he found her, folded her in eager arms." Together they wandered, and now he could look back "safely, at Eurydice."[^met-orpheus-reunion]

### Vengeance of Dionysus (11.67-84)

[Dionysus](../deities/dionysus.md) punished the maenads who killed Orpheus by transforming them into trees, thrusting their feet into the earth as roots until "wood growing up from them" covered their bodies.[^met-orpheus-vengeance]

[^met-orpheus-ghosts]: "the bloodless ghosts themselves were weeping, and the anxious Tantalus stopped clutching at return-flow of the wave, Ixion's twisting wheel stood wonder-bound; and Tityus' liver for a while escaped the vultures" (Metamorphoses 10.40-48, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-orpheus-look]: "in fear he might again lose her, and anxious for another look at her, he turned his eyes so he could gaze upon her. Instantly she slipped away" (Metamorphoses 10.56-59, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-orpheus-farewell]: "Her last word spoken was, 'Farewell!' which he could barely hear, and with no further sound she fell from him again to Hades" (Metamorphoses 10.62-63, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-orpheus-grief]: "Orpheus implored in vain the ferryman to help him cross the River Styx again, but was denied the very hope of death. Seven days he sat upon Death's river bank, in squalid misery and without all food" (Metamorphoses 10.72-77, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-orpheus-stone]: "The weapon of another was a stone, which in the very air was overpowered by the true harmony of his voice and lyre, and so disabled lay before his feet, as asking pardon for that vain attempt" (Metamorphoses 11.10-14, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-orpheus-drowned]: "the clamorous discord of their boxwood pipes, the blaring of their horns, their tambourines and clapping hands and Bacchanalian yells, with hideous discords drowned his voice and harp — at last the stones that heard his song no more fell crimson with the Thracian poet's blood" (Metamorphoses 11.16-23, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-orpheus-death]: "through those same lips which had controlled the rocks and which had overcome ferocious beasts, his life breathed forth, departed in the air" (Metamorphoses 11.41-43, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-orpheus-reunion]: "remembering now those regions that he saw when there before, he sought Eurydice through fields frequented by the blest; and when he found her, folded her in eager arms" (Metamorphoses 11.61-64, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-orpheus-vengeance]: "Bacchus would not permit the wickedness of those who slaughtered Orpheus to remain unpunished... he bound with twisted roots the feet of everyone of those Edonian women who had caused the crime of Orpheus' death" (Metamorphoses 11.67-76, trans. Brookes More)
