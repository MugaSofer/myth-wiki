## Overview

**Helen** is a daughter of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) whose extraordinary beauty caused the Trojan War. The sources present her in a complex light: she is simultaneously "sprung of Zeus," a victim of [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md)'s power, and a woman who laments her own role in the war. She is one of the few mortals who can see through a god's disguise, recognising Aphrodite by her divine features even when the goddess appears as an old woman. Two contradictory traditions exist for her birth -- from Leda or from Nemesis -- both involving Zeus.

## Parentage

### Zeus and Leda (Iliad tradition)

The [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) consistently calls Helen "sprung of Zeus" and "daughter of Zeus" but does not name her mother. The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) preserves the Leda tradition: "[Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) in the form of a swan consorted with Leda, and on the same night Tyndareus cohabited with her; and she bore Pollux and Helen to Zeus, and Castor and Clytaemnestra to Tyndareus."[^apd-leda]

[^apd-leda]: "Zeus in the form of a swan consorted with Leda, and on the same night Tyndareus cohabited with her; and she bore Pollux and Helen to Zeus, and Castor and Clytaemnestra to Tyndareus" (Bibliotheca 3.10.7, trans. Frazer)

### Zeus and Nemesis (Cypria)

The [Epic Cycle](../sources/epic-cycle.md)'s Cypria preserves a strikingly different account. Helen was born not of Leda but of Nemesis, the goddess of retribution, who was taken by Zeus through "harsh violence":

"Rich-tressed Nemesis once gave her birth when she had been joined in love with Zeus the king of the gods by harsh violence. For Nemesis tried to escape him and liked not to lie in love with her father Zeus the Son of Cronos; for shame and indignation vexed her heart: therefore she fled him over the land and fruitless dark water."[^cyp-nemesis]

Nemesis took the form of fish and "dread creatures" to escape Zeus, "but Zeus ever pursued and longed in his heart to catch her."[^cyp-nemesis-flight]

The Bibliotheca preserves the variant too: "some say that Helen was a daughter of Nemesis and Zeus; for that she, flying from the arms of Zeus, changed herself into a goose, but Zeus in his turn took the likeness of a swan and so enjoyed her; and as the fruit of their loves she laid an egg."[^apd-nemesis]

### Daughter of Ocean (Catalogue of Women)

A third tradition, preserved only in a scholiast citing the Catalogue of Women, makes Helen neither the daughter of Leda nor of Nemesis: "Hesiod, however, makes Helen the child neither of Leda nor Nemesis, but daughter of Ocean and Zeus."[^cat-ocean] This would make her not merely a mortal woman favoured by Zeus, but herself an Oceanid — a radically different genealogy with no other surviving elaboration.

[^cyp-nemesis]: "Rich-tressed Nemesis once gave her birth when she had been joined in love with Zeus the king of the gods by harsh violence. For Nemesis tried to escape him and liked not to lie in love with her father Zeus the Son of Cronos; for shame and indignation vexed her heart: therefore she fled him over the land and fruitless dark water" (Cypria, Fragment 8, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^cyp-nemesis-flight]: "But Zeus ever pursued and longed in his heart to catch her. Now she took the form of a fish and sped over the waves of the loud-roaring sea, and now over Ocean's stream and the furthest bounds of Earth, and now she sped over the furrowed land, always turning into such dread creatures as the dry land nurtures, that she might escape him" (Cypria, Fragment 8, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^apd-nemesis]: "some say that Helen was a daughter of Nemesis and Zeus; for that she, flying from the arms of Zeus, changed herself into a goose, but Zeus in his turn took the likeness of a swan and so enjoyed her; and as the fruit of their loves she laid an egg" (Bibliotheca 3.10.7, trans. Frazer)
[^cat-ocean]: "Hesiod, however, makes Helen the child neither of Leda nor Nemesis, but daughter of Ocean and Zeus" (Catalogue of Women, Fragment 66, cited by scholiast, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Appearance

The sources describe Helen's beauty almost entirely through its effect on others rather than through specific physical features. The Trojan elders, seeing her approach the walls, deliver the poem's definitive assessment: "marvellously like is she to the immortal goddesses to look upon."[^app-elders] This comparison to goddesses -- not to any mortal standard -- is the closest the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) comes to describing what she looks like.

The formulaic epithets provide the only concrete physical detail: she is repeatedly called "white-armed Helen,"[^app-white-armed] and addressed as "Helen, fair among women."[^app-fair] The [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) adds one further image: when she appears at Sparta, she comes "from her fragrant vaulted chamber, like Artemis of the golden arrows."[^app-artemis]

[^app-elders]: "marvellously like is she to the immortal goddesses to look upon" (Iliad III.1774, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^app-white-armed]: "Iris went with a message to white-armed Helen" (Iliad III.1743, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^app-fair]: "Helen, fair among women" (Iliad III.1790, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^app-artemis]: "Helen came forth from her fragrant vaulted chamber, like Artemis of the golden arrows" (Odyssey IV.2237, trans. Butcher and Lang)

## In the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md)

### Iris Summons Helen; the Tapestry (Book III)

[Iris](../deities/iris.md) comes to Helen "in the likeness of her husband's sister... Laodike fairest favoured of Priam's daughters" and summons her to watch the duel between Menelaos and Paris. The goddess "put into her heart sweet longing for her former husband and her city and parents."[^il3-iris]

Helen is found at her loom, "weaving a great purple web of double fold, and embroidering thereon many battles of horse-taming Trojans and mail-clad Achaians, that they had endured for her sake at the hands of Ares."[^il3-tapestry] She is literally weaving the story of the war she has caused -- an image of extraordinary self-consciousness.

[^il3-iris]: "Iris went with a message to white-armed Helen in the likeness of her husband's sister... So spake the goddess, and put into her heart sweet longing for her former husband and her city and parents" (Iliad III.1743-1759, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il3-tapestry]: "in the hall she found Helen weaving a great purple web of double fold, and embroidering thereon many battles of horse-taming Trojans and mail-clad Achaians, that they had endured for her sake at the hands of Ares" (Iliad III.1746-1749, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

### On the Wall with Priam (Book III)

On the tower, the Trojan elders see Helen and speak the poem's most famous judgement of her beauty: "Small blame is it that Trojans and well-greaved Achaians should for such a woman long time suffer hardships; marvellously like is she to the immortal goddesses to look upon."[^il3-elders]

Priam himself holds her blameless: "I hold thee not to blame; nay, I hold the gods to blame who brought on me the dolorous war of the Achaians." Helen's self-loathing is immediate: "Reverend art thou to me and dread, dear father of my lord; would that sore death had been my pleasure when I followed thy son hither, and left my home and my kinsfolk and my daughter in her girlhood and the lovely company of mine age-fellows."[^il3-priam]

[^il3-elders]: "Small blame is it that Trojans and well-greaved Achaians should for such a woman long time suffer hardships; marvellously like is she to the immortal goddesses to look upon" (Iliad III.1772-1774, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il3-priam]: "I hold thee not to blame; nay, I hold the gods to blame who brought on me the dolorous war of the Achaians... Reverend art thou to me and dread, dear father of my lord; would that sore death had been my pleasure when I followed thy son hither" (Iliad III.1783-1793, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

### Aphrodite's Disguise and Threat (Book III)

After [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md) rescues Paris from the duel, she comes to Helen "in the likeness of an aged dame, a woolcomber that was wont to work for her fair wool when she dwelt in Lakedaimon." But Helen sees through the disguise: "she marked the fair neck and lovely breast and sparkling eyes of the goddess, she marvelled straightway."[^il3-disguise]

Helen defies her: "Go and sit thou by his side, and depart from the way of the gods; neither let thy feet ever bear thee back to [Olympus](../places/olympus.md)."[^il3-defiance]

[Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md) responds with a threat that reveals the full extent of her power over Helen: "Provoke me not, rash woman, lest in mine anger I desert thee, and hate thee even as now I love thee beyond measure, and lest I devise grievous enmities between both, even betwixt Trojans and Achaians, and so thou perish in evil wise."[^il3-threat]

Helen obeys in fear. The goddess herself carries a chair for her and sets it before Paris. Helen sits down, "the child of aegis-bearing Zeus, and with eyes turned askance spake and chode her lord."[^il3-chair]

This scene is central to Helen's characterisation: she can recognise divine power, she dares to resist it, but ultimately she cannot overcome it. [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md)'s claim to love her "beyond measure" while threatening her destruction captures the coercive nature of the goddess's patronage.

[^il3-disguise]: "she marked the fair neck and lovely breast and sparkling eyes of the goddess, she marvelled straightway and spake a word and called upon her name: 'Strange queen, why art thou desirous now to beguile me?'" (Iliad III.1994-1996, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il3-defiance]: "Go and sit thou by his side, and depart from the way of the gods; neither let thy feet ever bear thee back to Olympus" (Iliad III.2001-2003, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il3-threat]: "Provoke me not, rash woman, lest in mine anger I desert thee, and hate thee even as now I love thee beyond measure, and lest I devise grievous enmities between both, even betwixt Trojans and Achaians, and so thou perish in evil wise" (Iliad III.2009-2013, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il3-chair]: "laughter-loving Aphrodite took for her a chair and brought it, even she the goddess, and set it before the face of Paris. There Helen took her seat, the child of aegis-bearing Zeus, and with eyes turned askance spake and chode her lord" (Iliad III.2021-2024, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

### Castor and Pollux (Book III)

While surveying the Achaian army from the wall, Helen searches for her brothers: "two captains of the host can I not see, even Kastor tamer of horses and Polydeukes the skilful boxer, mine own brethren, whom the same mother bare. Either they came not in the company from lovely Lakedaimon; or they came hither indeed in their seafaring ships, but now will not enter into the battle of the warriors, for fear of the many scornings and revilings that are mine."[^il3-brothers]

The poet gives the devastating answer in his own voice: "So said she; but them the life-giving earth held fast there in Lakedaimon, in their dear native land."[^il3-dead] Helen does not know her brothers are already dead.

[^il3-brothers]: "two captains of the host can I not see, even Kastor tamer of horses and Polydeukes the skilful boxer, mine own brethren, whom the same mother bare. Either they came not in the company from lovely Lakedaimon; or they came hither indeed in their seafaring ships, but now will not enter into the battle of the warriors, for fear of the many scornings and revilings that are mine" (Iliad III.1850-1855, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il3-dead]: "So said she; but them the life-giving earth held fast there in Lakedaimon, in their dear native land" (Iliad III.1857-1858)

### Helen's Lament for Hector (Book XXIV)

Helen's final speech in the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) is her lament over Hector's body, and it reveals both her isolation and Hector's unique kindness to her: "Hector, of all my brethren of Troy far dearest to my heart! Truly my lord is godlike Alexandros who brought me to Troy-land -- would I had died ere then. For this is now the twentieth year since I went thence and am gone from my own native land, but never yet heard I evil or despiteful word from thee."[^il24-lament]

She concludes: "no more is any left in wide Troy-land to be my friend and kind to me, but all men shudder at me."[^il24-shudder]

[^il24-lament]: "Hector, of all my brethren of Troy far dearest to my heart! Truly my lord is godlike Alexandros who brought me to Troy-land—would I had died ere then. For this is now the twentieth year since I went thence and am gone from my own native land, but never yet heard I evil or despiteful word from thee" (Iliad XXIV.14204-14208, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il24-shudder]: "no more is any left in wide Troy-land to be my friend and kind to me, but all men shudder at me" (Iliad XXIV.14214-14215, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

## In the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md)

### The Blindness of Aphrodite (Book IV)

Helen appears at Sparta with Menelaos when Telemachus visits. She emerges "from her fragrant vaulted chamber, like [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md) of the golden arrows," and immediately recognises Telemachus by his likeness to his father.[^od4-entrance]

She casts a drug (nepenthe) into the wine: "a drug to lull all pain and anger, and bring forgetfulness of every sorrow. Whoso should drink a draught thereof, when it is mingled in the bowl, on that day he would let no tear fall down his cheeks, not though his mother and his father died." This drug came from "Polydamna, the wife of Thon, a woman of Egypt, where earth the grain-giver yields herbs in greatest plenty."[^od4-nepenthe]

She then tells how she recognised [Odysseus](odysseus.md) disguised in Troy, and in this speech delivers the critical theological line about her own agency: "now at the last I groaned for the blindness that [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md) gave me, when she led me thither away from mine own country, forsaking my child and my bridal chamber and my lord, that lacked not aught whether for wisdom or yet for beauty."[^od4-blindness]

The word "blindness" (ate) is the same concept [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) attributes to mortal folly in Odyssey I. Helen uses it to describe Aphrodite's control over her as a form of divinely imposed delusion.

[^od4-entrance]: "Helen came forth from her fragrant vaulted chamber, like Artemis of the golden arrows" (Odyssey IV.2236-2237, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od4-nepenthe]: "she cast a drug into the wine whereof they drank, a drug to lull all pain and anger, and bring forgetfulness of every sorrow. Whoso should drink a draught thereof, when it is mingled in the bowl, on that day he would let no tear fall down his cheeks, not though his mother and his father died... Medicines of such virtue and so helpful had the daughter of Zeus, which Polydamna, the wife of Thon, had given her, a woman of Egypt" (Odyssey IV.2344-2351, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od4-blindness]: "now at the last I groaned for the blindness that Aphrodite gave me, when she led me thither away from mine own country, forsaking my child and my bridal chamber and my lord, that lacked not aught whether for wisdom or yet for beauty" (Odyssey IV.2380-2383, trans. Butcher and Lang)

### Helen Interprets the Eagle Omen (Book XV)

When Telemachus departs from Sparta, an eagle flies past carrying a goose. Menelaos ponders its meaning, but Helen speaks first with prophetic authority: "Hear me, and I will prophesy as the immortals put it into my heart, and as I deem it will be accomplished. Even as yonder eagle came down from the hill, the place of his birth and kin, and snatched away the goose that was fostered in the house, even so shall [Odysseus](odysseus.md) return home after much trial and long wanderings and take vengeance."[^od15-omen]

[^od15-omen]: "Hear me, and I will prophesy as the immortals put it into my heart, and as I deem it will be accomplished. Even as yonder eagle came down from the hill, the place of his birth and kin, and snatched away the goose that was fostered in the house, even so shall Odysseus return home after much trial and long wanderings and take vengeance; yea, or even now is he at home and sowing the seeds of evil for all the wooers" (Odyssey XV.8128-8134, trans. Butcher and Lang)

### Penelope's Defence of Helen (Book XXIII)

In a striking passage, Penelope invokes Helen to explain her own caution with the returned Odysseus: "Nay even Argive Helen, daughter of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md), would not have lain with a stranger, and taken him for a lover, had she known that the warlike sons of the Achaeans would bring her home again to her own dear country. Howsoever, it was the god that set her upon this shameful deed."[^od23-penelope]

[^od23-penelope]: "Nay even Argive Helen, daughter of Zeus, would not have lain with a stranger, and taken him for a lover, had she known that the warlike sons of the Achaeans would bring her home again to her own dear country. Howsoever, it was the god that set her upon this shameful deed" (Odyssey XXIII.12400-12403, trans. Butcher and Lang)

## In the Catalogue of Women

### Aphrodite's Curse on Tyndareus's Daughters

The Catalogue preserves a tradition explaining Helen's role through [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md)'s anger at Tyndareus for neglecting her in sacrifice: "laughter-loving Aphrodite felt jealous when she looked on them and cast them into evil report. Then Timandra deserted Echemus and went and came to Phyleus, dear to the deathless gods; and even so Clytaemnestra deserted god-like Agamemnon and lay with Aegisthus and chose a worse mate; and even so Helen dishonoured the couch of golden-haired Menelaus."[^cat-aphrodite-curse] All three daughters of Tyndareus were cursed to desert their husbands — Helen's faithlessness is thus part of a divine pattern, not an isolated choice.

### The Suitors

The Catalogue contains the fullest surviving account of Helen's suitors, listing them individually with their gifts and home cities. Among them: Odysseus from Ithaca ("he never sent gifts for the sake of the neat-ankled maid, for he knew in his heart that golden-haired Menelaus would win"), Ajax from Salamis (who offered to drive together all the cattle of Troezen and Epidaurus), Idomeneus from Crete, and many others. "But of all who came for the maid's sake, the lord Tyndareus sent none away, nor yet received the gift of any, but asked of all the suitors sure oaths." In the end "warlike Menelaus, the son of Atreus, prevailed against them all together, because he gave the greatest gifts."[^cat-suitors]

The Catalogue adds that Achilles was not among the suitors only because of his age: "neither warlike Menelaus nor any other of men on earth would have prevailed in suit for Helen, if fleet Achilles had found her unwed."[^cat-achilles]

[^cat-aphrodite-curse]: "laughter-loving Aphrodite felt jealous when she looked on them and cast them into evil report. Then Timandra deserted Echemus... and even so Clytaemnestra deserted god-like Agamemnon and lay with Aegisthus and chose a worse mate; and even so Helen dishonoured the couch of golden-haired Menelaus" (Catalogue of Women, Fragment 67, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^cat-suitors]: "But of all who came for the maid's sake, the lord Tyndareus sent none away, nor yet received the gift of any, but asked of all the suitors sure oaths... But warlike Menelaus, the son of Atreus, prevailed against them all together, because he gave the greatest gifts" (Catalogue of Women, Fragment 68, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^cat-achilles]: "neither warlike Menelaus nor any other of men on earth would have prevailed in suit for Helen, if fleet Achilles had found her unwed. But, as it was, warlike Menelaus won her before" (Catalogue of Women, Fragment 68, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## In the [Epic Cycle](../sources/epic-cycle.md)

### The Cypria

The Cypria is the primary source for events leading to the war. [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) plans the Trojan War with [Themis](../deities/themis.md) to relieve the overpopulated earth, and the chain of causation runs through Helen: [Strife](../deities/night.md) arrives at the wedding of Peleus and [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md); [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md) wins the Judgment of Paris; Paris is promised Helen; "Alexandrus, lured by his promised marriage with Helen, decides in favour of Aphrodite."[^cyp-judgment]

The Cypria also contains the Nemesis variant of Helen's birth (see Parentage above), which presents her not merely as a daughter of Zeus but as the offspring of divine retribution herself, born through violence and flight.

[^cyp-judgment]: "Alexandrus, lured by his promised marriage with Helen, decides in favour of Aphrodite" (Cypria, summary by Proclus, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## In the Fabulae

### Birth from Leda (§77)

The Fabulae gives the traditional account: "Jupiter, changed into a swan, had intercourse with Leda near the river Eurotas, and from that embrace she bore Pollux and Helen; to Tyndareus she bore Castor and Clytemnestra."[^hyg77-leda]

[^hyg77-leda]: "Jupiter, changed into a swan, had intercourse with Leda near the river Eurotas, and from that embrace she bore Pollux and Helen; to Tyndareus she bore Castor and Clytemnestra" (Fabulae §77, trans. Mary Grant)

### Tyndareus and the Suitors (§78)

Hyginus explains that Tyndareus delayed the suitor decision out of fear: "Because of her exceeding beauty many suitors from many states sought Helen in marriage. Tyndareus, since he feared that Agamemnon might divorce his daughter Clytemnestra, and that discord might arise from this, at the advice of [Ulysses](odysseus.md) bound himself by an oath."[^hyg78-oath] The oath came from Odysseus's counsel, and in exchange Tyndareus "gave Helen leave to put a wreath on whomever she wished to marry. She put it on Menelaus, and Tyndareus gave her to him in marriage and at his death left him his kingdom."[^hyg78-choice]

[^hyg78-oath]: "Because of her exceeding beauty many suitors from many states sought Helen in marriage. Tyndareus, since he feared that Agamemnon might divorce his daughter Clytemnestra, and that discord might arise from this, at the advice of Ulysses bound himself by an oath" (Fabulae §78, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg78-choice]: "and gave Helen leave to put a wreath on whomever she wished to marry. She put it on Menelaus, and Tyndareus gave her to him in marriage and at his death left him his kingdom" (Fabulae §78, trans. Mary Grant)

### Abduction by Theseus (§79)

The account of Theseus's abduction adds theological motivation: "[Theseus](theseus.md), son of Aegeus and Aethra, daughter of Pittheus, along with Pirithous, son of Ixion, carried off the maiden Helen, daughter of Tyndareus and Leda, from the shrine of [Diana](../deities/artemis.md) while she was sacrificing, and took her to Athens, to a district of the Attic region."[^hyg79-abduction]

[Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) punished this hubris by sending them to [Hades](../deities/hades.md): "When [Jove](../deities/zeus.md) saw that they had such audacity as to expose themselves to danger, he bade them in a dream both go and ask [Pluto](../deities/hades.md) on Pirithous' part for [Proserpine](../deities/persephone.md) in marriage."[^hyg79-dream] When they descended, "they were stretched out and tortured for a long time by the Furies."[^hyg79-torture] [Heracles](heracles.md) "obtained the favour from Pluto, and brought them out unharmed."[^hyg79-rescue]

The consequence for Theseus's family: "Castor and Pollux, Helen's brothers, fought for her sake, and took Aethra, Theseus' mother, and Phisadie, Pirithous' sister, and gave them in servitude to their sister."[^hyg79-revenge]

[^hyg79-abduction]: "Theseus, son of Aegeus and Aethra, daughter of Pittheus, along with Pirithous, son of Ixion, carried off the maiden Helen, daughter of Tyndareus and Leda, from the shrine of Diana while she was sacrificing, and took her to Athens, to a district of the Attic region" (Fabulae §79, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg79-dream]: "When Jove saw that they had such audacity as to expose themselves to danger, he bade them in a dream both go and ask Pluto on Pirithous' part for Proserpine in marriage" (Fabulae §79, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg79-torture]: "When they had descended to the Land of the Dead through the peninsula Taenarus, and had informed Pluto why they had come, they were stretched out and tortured for a long time by the Furies" (Fabulae §79, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg79-rescue]: "When Hercules came to lead out the three-headed dog, they begged his promise of protection. He obtained the favour from Pluto, and brought them out unharmed" (Fabulae §79, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg79-revenge]: "Castor and Pollux, Helen's brothers, fought for her sake, and took Aethra, Theseus' mother, and Phisadie, Pirithous' sister, and gave them in servitude to their sister" (Fabulae §79, trans. Mary Grant)

### List of Suitors (§81)

The Fabulae provides a full catalog of Helen's suitors: "Antilochus, Ascalaphus, Ajax, son of Oileus, Amphimachus, [Ancaeus], Blanirus, Agapenor, Ajax, son of Telamon, Clytius the Cyanean, Menelaus, Patroclus, Diomedes, Peneleus, Phemius, Nireus, Polypoetes, Elephenor, Eumelus, Sthenelus, Tlepolemus, Protesilaus, Podalirius, Eurypylus, Idomeneus, Leonteus, Thalpius, Polyxenus, Prothous, Menestheus, Machaon, Thoas, [Ulysses](odysseus.md), Phidippus, Meriones, Meges, Philoctetes. Older writers mention others."[^hyg81-suitors]

[^hyg81-suitors]: "Antilochus, Ascalaphus, Ajax, son of Oileus, Amphimachus, [Ancaeus], Blanirus, Agapenor, Ajax, son of Telamon, Clytius the Cyanean, Menelaus, Patroclus, Diomedes, Peneleus, Phemius, Nireus, Polypoetes, Elephenor, Eumelus, Sthenelus, Tlepolemus, Protesilaus, Podalirius, Eurypylus, Idomeneus, Leonteus, Thalpius, Polyxenus, Prothous, Menestheus, Machaon, Thoas, Ulysses, Phidippus, Meriones, Meges, Philoctetes. Older writers mention others" (Fabulae §81, trans. Mary Grant)

### The Judgment of Paris (§92)

Hyginus narrates the Judgment in detail. [Jove](../deities/zeus.md) "invited to the wedding of Peleus and [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md) all the gods except Eris, or Discordia."[^hyg92-eris] The goddess of discord "threw an apple through the door, saying that the fairest should take it. [Juno](../deities/hera.md), [Venus](../deities/aphrodite.md), and [Minerva](../deities/athena.md) claimed the beauty prize for themselves."[^hyg92-apple]

The bribes are detailed: "Juno promised him, if he should judge in her favour, that he would rule over all the lands and be pre-eminent wealth. Minerva promised that if she should come out victorious, he would be bravest of mortals and skilled in every craft. Venus, however, promised to give him in marriage Helen, daughter of Tyndareus, most beautiful of all women."[^hyg92-bribes]

After Paris judged Venus the winner, "On account of this, Juno and Minerva were hostile to the Trojans."[^hyg92-consequence] Paris "took Helen from his host Menelaus from Lacedemon to [Troy](../places/troy.md), and married her. She took with her two handmaids, Aethra and Thisiadie, captives, but once queens, whom Castor and Pollux had assigned to her."[^hyg92-handmaids]
