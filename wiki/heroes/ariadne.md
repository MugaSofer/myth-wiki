# Ariadne

Daughter of **[Minos](minos.md)** and Pasiphae. Ariadne helped **[Theseus](theseus.md)** escape the Labyrinth, was abandoned on Naxos, and became the consort of **[Dionysus](../deities/dionysus.md)**.

## In the [Argonautica](../sources/argonautica.md)

Jason invoked Ariadne as a precedent when appealing to [Medea](../heroes/medea.md) for help. He described her as "the maiden Ariadne, daughter of [Minos](minos.md), with kindly intent rescued Theseus from grim contests — the maiden whom Pasiphae daughter of Helios bare."[^arg-ariadne-jason] Medea asked Jason about Ariadne in turn, as Ariadne was her kinswoman through Pasiphae.[^arg-ariadne-medea]

The Argonautica also notes that on the island of Dia, Theseus had forsaken Ariadne there; and that [Dionysus](../deities/dionysus.md)'s sacred robe had its origin on that island.[^arg-ariadne-dia] Ariadne's crown eventually became a constellation.[^arg-ariadne-crown]

[^arg-ariadne-jason]: "the maiden Ariadne, daughter of Minos, with kindly intent rescued Theseus from grim contests — the maiden whom Pasiphae daughter of Helios bare" (Argonautica 3.997-1001, trans. R.C. Seaton)
[^arg-ariadne-medea]: Medea and Ariadne were kinswomen through Pasiphae; Medea asked Jason about her (Argonautica 3.1074-1076, trans. R.C. Seaton)
[^arg-ariadne-dia]: On the island of Dia Theseus forsook Ariadne; the sacred robe of Dionysus was made there (Argonautica 4.423-434, trans. R.C. Seaton)
[^arg-ariadne-crown]: Ariadne's crown became a constellation in the sky (Argonautica 3.1003-1004, trans. R.C. Seaton)

## In the Theogony

"Golden-haired Dionysus made brown-haired Ariadne, the daughter of Minos, his buxom wife: and the son of [Cronos](../deities/cronos.md) made her deathless and unageing for him."[^theog-ariadne]

## In the Odyssey

Homer gives a darker account. In the catalogue of heroines: "[Artemis](../deities/artemis.md) slew her ere that in sea-girt Dia, by reason of the witness of Dionysus."[^od11-ariadne]

## In the Catalogue of Women

Hesiod gives a different reason for Ariadne's abandonment: "strong love for Aegle the daughter of Panopeus overpowered him," suggesting [Theseus](theseus.md) left Ariadne not because of divine intervention but for another woman.[^cat-aegle] Hereas of Megara claimed Peisistratus removed this verse from Hesiod's works.

[^cat-aegle]: "For strong love for Aegle the daughter of Panopeus overpowered him" (Catalogue of Women, Fragment 76, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## In the Bibliotheca (E.1.8-1.9)

When Theseus came to Crete as tribute for the Minotaur, "Ariadne, daughter of Minos, being amorously disposed to him, offered to help him if he would agree to carry her away to Athens and have her to wife."[^apd-ariadne-offer] Theseus agreed on oath, and she consulted Daedalus, who suggested the clue of thread.

She gave Theseus the thread when he entered the Labyrinth. He fastened it to the door, found and killed the Minotaur, then drew the thread to find his way out. By night Theseus sailed with Ariadne and the tribute children to Naxos, but "there Dionysus fell in love with Ariadne and carried her off; and having brought her to Lemnos he enjoyed her, and begat Thoas, Staphylus, Oenopion, and Peparethus."[^apd-ariadne-naxos]

## In the Fabulae

### Helping Theseus (§42)

Hyginus explains Ariadne's motivation: "When Theseus came to Crete, Ariadne, [Minos](minos.md)' daughter, loved him so much that she betrayed her brother and saved the stranger, or she showed Theseus the way out of the Labyrinth."[^hyg42-love] The alternative phrasing suggests either she actively betrayed the Minotaur or simply aided Theseus's escape. "When Theseus had entered and killed the Minotaur, by Ariadne's advice he got out by unwinding the thread. Ariadne, because she had been loyal to him, he took away, intending to marry her."[^hyg42-escape]

[^hyg42-love]: "When Theseus came to Crete, Ariadne, Minos' daughter, loved him so much that she betrayed her brother and saved the stranger, or she showed Theseus the way out of the Labyrinth" (Fabulae §42, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg42-escape]: "When Theseus had entered and killed the Minotaur, by Ariadne's advice he got out by unwinding the thread. Ariadne, because she had been loyal to him, he took away, intending to marry her" (Fabulae §42, trans. Mary Grant)

### Abandoned on Dia (§43)

The reason for abandonment differs from divine intervention: "Theseus, detained by a storm on the island of Dia, thought it would be a reproach to him if he brought Ariadne to Athens, and so he left her asleep on the island of Dia."[^hyg43-reproach] This suggests Theseus's own choice rather than divine command.

[Liber](../deities/dionysus.md) (Dionysus) then intervened: "Liber, falling in love with her, took her from there as his wife."[^hyg43-liber] A tragic detail follows about Theseus: "However, when Theseus left, he forgot to change the black sails, and so his father Aegeus judged that he had been devoured by the Minotaur. He threw himself into the sea, which was called Aegean from this."[^hyg43-sails]

The Fabulae adds that "Theseus married Phaedra, Ariadne's sister."[^hyg43-phaedra]

[^hyg43-reproach]: "Theseus, detained by a storm on the island of Dia, thought it would be a reproach to him if he brought Ariadne to Athens, and so he left her asleep on the island of Dia" (Fabulae §43, trans. Mary Grant)
