# Ariadne

Daughter of **[Minos](minos.md)** and Pasiphae. Ariadne helped **[Theseus](theseus.md)** escape the Labyrinth, was abandoned on Naxos, and became the consort of **[Dionysus](../deities/dionysus.md)**.

## In the Theogony

"Golden-haired Dionysus made brown-haired Ariadne, the daughter of Minos, his buxom wife: and the son of [Cronos](../deities/cronos.md) made her deathless and unageing for him."[^theog-ariadne]

## In the Odyssey

Homer gives a darker account. In the catalogue of heroines: "[Artemis](../deities/artemis.md) slew her ere that in sea-girt Dia, by reason of the witness of Dionysus."[^od11-ariadne]

## In the Bibliotheca (E.1.8-1.9)

When Theseus came to Crete as tribute for the Minotaur, "Ariadne, daughter of Minos, being amorously disposed to him, offered to help him if he would agree to carry her away to Athens and have her to wife."[^apd-ariadne-offer] Theseus agreed on oath, and she consulted Daedalus, who suggested the clue of thread.

She gave Theseus the thread when he entered the Labyrinth. He fastened it to the door, found and killed the Minotaur, then drew the thread to find his way out. By night Theseus sailed with Ariadne and the tribute children to Naxos, but "there Dionysus fell in love with Ariadne and carried her off; and having brought her to Lemnos he enjoyed her, and begat Thoas, Staphylus, Oenopion, and Peparethus."[^apd-ariadne-naxos]
