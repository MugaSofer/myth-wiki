## Overview

**Cecrops** was the first king of Attica, described as autochthonous — born from the soil itself — with a body compounded of man and serpent. He renamed the land Cecropia after himself. He is best known as the witness who confirmed [Athena](../deities/athena.md)'s claim to Athens in her contest with [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md).

Note: A second figure named Cecrops — son of [Erechtheus](erechtheus.md) — appears later in the same genealogy and should not be confused with this first Cecrops. See [Erechtheus](erechtheus.md) for details.

## In the [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md)

### First King of Attica (3.14.1)

Cecrops "with a body compounded of man and serpent, was the first king of Attica, and the country which was formerly called Acte he named Cecropia after himself."[^apd-cecrops-origin]

### The Contest for Athens (3.14.1)

In his reign, the gods competed to take possession of cities in which each would receive their own worship. [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) arrived first in Attica and struck the acropolis with his trident, producing a sea known as the Erechtheis. [Athena](../deities/athena.md) followed and, calling on Cecrops to witness, planted an olive tree — "which is still shown in the Pandrosium."[^apd-cecrops-olive]

Zeus appointed twelve gods as arbiters. The country was adjudged to Athena "because Cecrops bore witness that she had been the first to plant the olive."[^apd-cecrops-witness] Athena named the city Athens after herself. Poseidon, in anger, flooded the Thriasian plain and laid Attica under the sea.[^apd-cecrops-flood]

The text notes alternative traditions: some said the arbiters were Cecrops and Cranaus, or Erysichthon, but Apollodorus favors the twelve gods.[^apd-cecrops-arbiter]

### Family (3.14.2)

Cecrops married Agraulus, daughter of Actaeus, and had a son Erysichthon, "who departed this life childless."[^apd-cecrops-son] His three daughters were Agraulus, Herse, and Pandrosus.

Agraulus had a daughter Alcippe by [Ares](../deities/ares.md). When Halirrhothius, son of [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) and the nymph Euryte, attempted to violate Alcippe, Ares caught and killed him. Poseidon impeached Ares, and Ares was tried before the twelve gods in the Areopagus and acquitted.[^apd-cecrops-areopagus]

### The Chest of Erichthonius (3.14.6)

Cecrops's daughter Pandrosus was the one to whom [Athena](../deities/athena.md) entrusted the chest containing the infant [Erichthonius](erichthonius.md), with a prohibition against opening it. It was the sisters of Pandrosus who opened the chest out of curiosity; Pandrosus herself apparently obeyed the instruction. See [Erichthonius](erichthonius.md) for the full account.

## Second Cecrops

A second Cecrops appears in the Athenian king genealogy as the eldest son of [Erechtheus](erechtheus.md). After Poseidon destroyed Erechtheus and his house, "Cecrops, the eldest of the sons of Erechtheus, succeeded to the throne."[^apd-cecrops2-king] He married Metiadusa, daughter of Eupalamus, and fathered [Pandion II](pandion.md).[^apd-cecrops2-son] (Bibliotheca 3.15.5)
