## Overview

**Medea** is a sorceress, daughter of Aeetes (king of Colchis, son of [Helius](../deities/helius.md)) and Idyia (daughter of [Oceanus](../deities/oceanus.md)). Her story in the [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) spans from her love for [Jason](jason.md) in Colchis to her return to her father's kingdom.

## In the Bibliotheca

### Helping Jason at Colchis

When [Jason](jason.md) was charged with yoking the brazen-footed fire-breathing bulls, "Medea conceived a passion for him; now she was a witch, daughter of Aeetes and Idyia, daughter of Ocean."[^apd-passion] She promised to help him "if he would swear to have her to wife and would take her with him on the voyage to Greece."[^apd-oath]

She gave him a drug rendering him immune to fire and iron for a day, and told him how to defeat the armed men that would spring from the dragon's teeth: "when he saw a knot of them he was to throw stones into their midst from a distance, and when they fought each other about that, he was taken to kill them."[^apd-stones]

After Aeetes refused to surrender the fleece, Medea "brought Jason by night to the fleece, and having lulled to sleep by her drugs the dragon that guarded it, she possessed herself of the fleece."[^apd-dragon]

[^apd-passion]: "Medea conceived a passion for him; now she was a witch, daughter of Aeetes and Idyia, daughter of Ocean" (Bibliotheca 1.9.23, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-oath]: "she, keeping the thing from her father, promised to help him to yoke the bulls and to deliver to him the fleece, if he would swear to have her to wife and would take her with him on the voyage to Greece" (Bibliotheca 1.9.23, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-stones]: "when he saw a knot of them he was to throw stones into their midst from a distance, and when they fought each other about that, he was taken to kill them" (Bibliotheca 1.9.23, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-dragon]: "Medea brought Jason by night to the fleece, and having lulled to sleep by her drugs the dragon that guarded it, she possessed herself of the fleece and in Jason's company came to the Argo" (Bibliotheca 1.9.23, trans. Frazer)

### Murder of Apsyrtus

When Aeetes pursued the Argo, "Medea murdered her brother and cutting him limb from limb threw the pieces into the deep. Gathering the child's limbs, Aeetes fell behind in the pursuit; wherefore he turned back, and, having buried the rescued limbs of his child, he called the place Tomi."[^apd-apsyrtus]

[^apd-apsyrtus]: "Medea murdered her brother and cutting him limb from limb threw the pieces into the deep. Gathering the child's limbs, Aeetes fell behind in the pursuit; wherefore he turned back, and, having buried the rescued limbs of his child, he called the place Tomi" (Bibliotheca 1.9.24, trans. Frazer)

### Purification and the Return

[Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) sent a storm in anger at the murder, and the Argo itself spoke, saying the wrath would not cease unless they were purified by [Circe](../deities/circe.md). They sailed to Aeaea, "where they supplicated Circe and were purified."[^apd-circe]

At Corcyra, when the Colchians demanded Medea back, King Alcinous declared "that if she already knew Jason, he would give her to him, but that if she were still a maid he would send her away to her father." His wife Arete "anticipated matters by marrying Medea to Jason."[^apd-alcinous]

On Crete, the brazen man Talos guarded the island. "His death was brought about by the wiles of Medea, whether, as some say, she drove him mad by drugs, or, as others say, she promised to make him immortal and then drew out the nail, so that all the ichor gushed out and he died."[^apd-talos]

[^apd-circe]: "they skirted Tyrrhenia and came to Aeaea, where they supplicated Circe and were purified" (Bibliotheca 1.9.24, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-alcinous]: "if she already knew Jason, he would give her to him, but that if she were still a maid he would send her away to her father. However, Arete, wife of Alcinous, anticipated matters by marrying Medea to Jason" (Bibliotheca 1.9.25, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-talos]: "His death was brought about by the wiles of Medea, whether, as some say, she drove him mad by drugs, or, as others say, she promised to make him immortal and then drew out the nail, so that all the ichor gushed out and he died" (Bibliotheca 1.9.26, trans. Frazer)

### Killing Pelias

At Iolcus, Medea "repaired to the palace of Pelias and persuaded his daughters to make mince meat of their father and boil him, promising to make him young again by her drugs; and to win their confidence she cut up a ram and made it into a lamb by boiling it. So they believed her, made mince meat of their father and boiled him."[^apd-pelias]

[^apd-pelias]: "she repaired to the palace of Pelias and persuaded his daughters to make mince meat of their father and boil him, promising to make him young again by her drugs; and to win their confidence she cut up a ram and made it into a lamb by boiling it. So they believed her, made mince meat of their father and boiled him" (Bibliotheca 1.9.27, trans. Frazer)

### At Corinth

After ten years in Corinth, Jason divorced Medea and married Glauce, daughter of King Creon. Medea "invoked the gods by whom Jason had sworn, and after often upbraiding him with his ingratitude she sent the bride a robe steeped in poison, which when Glauce had put on, she was consumed with fierce fire along with her father, who went to her rescue."[^apd-glauce]

She then killed her own children: "Mermerus and Pheres, the children whom Medea had by Jason, she killed." She escaped on "a car drawn by winged dragons" given to her by [Helius](../deities/helius.md).[^apd-infanticide]

> **VARIANT:** "Another tradition is that on her flight she left behind her children, who were still infants, setting them as suppliants on the altar of Hera of the Height; but the Corinthians removed them and wounded them to death."[^apd-variant]

[^apd-glauce]: "she sent the bride a robe steeped in poison, which when Glauce had put on, she was consumed with fierce fire along with her father, who went to her rescue" (Bibliotheca 1.9.28, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-infanticide]: "Mermerus and Pheres, the children whom Medea had by Jason, she killed, and having got from the Sun a car drawn by winged dragons she fled on it to Athens" (Bibliotheca 1.9.28, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-variant]: "Another tradition is that on her flight she left behind her children, who were still infants, setting them as suppliants on the altar of Hera of the Height; but the Corinthians removed them and wounded them to death" (Bibliotheca 1.9.28, trans. Frazer)

### At Athens and After

"Medea came to Athens, and being there married to Aegeus bore him a son Medus." She later plotted against Theseus and "was driven a fugitive from Athens with her son." Medus "conquered many barbarians and called the whole country under him Media, and marching against the Indians he met his death."[^apd-athens]

Finally, "Medea came unknown to Colchis, and finding that Aeetes had been deposed by his brother Perses, she killed Perses and restored the kingdom to her father."[^apd-colchis]

[^apd-athens]: "Medea came to Athens, and being there married to Aegeus bore him a son Medus. Afterwards, however, plotting against Theseus, she was driven a fugitive from Athens with her son. But he conquered many barbarians and called the whole country under him Media" (Bibliotheca 1.9.28, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-colchis]: "Medea came unknown to Colchis, and finding that Aeetes had been deposed by his brother Perses, she killed Perses and restored the kingdom to her father" (Bibliotheca 1.9.28, trans. Frazer)

## In the Fabulae

### Helping Jason (§22)

The Fabulae attributes Medea's love to divine intervention: "[Juno](../deities/hera.md), however, wished to save [Jason](jason.md), because once when she had come to a river and wished to test the minds of men, she assumed an old woman's form, and asked to be carried across. He had carried her across when others who had passed over despised her. And so since she knew that Jason could not perform the commands without help of Medea, she asked [Venus](../deities/aphrodite.md) to inspire Medea with love."[^hyg22-love]

After Jason completed the tasks, "When the dragon was lulled to sleep with drugs he took the fleece from the shrine, and set off for his country with Medea."[^hyg22-fleece]

[^hyg22-love]: "Juno, however, wished to save Jason, because once when she had come to a river and wished to test the minds of men, she assumed an old woman's form, and asked to be carried across. He had carried her across when others who had passed over despised her. And so since she knew that Jason could not perform the commands without help of Medea, she asked Venus to inspire Medea with love. At Venus' instigation, Jason was loved by Medea" (Fabulae §22, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg22-fleece]: "When the dragon was lulled to sleep with drugs he took the fleece from the shrine, and set off for his country with Medea" (Fabulae §22, trans. Mary Grant)

### Absyrtus (§23)

Hyginus names her brother as "Absyrtus" and locates the pursuit at "the Adriatic Sea in Histria at King Alcinous' court."[^hyg23-location] The arbitration differs from other accounts: "When he [Absyrtus] had caught up with her in the Adriatic Sea in Histria at King Alcinous' court, and would fight for her, Alcinous intervened to prevent their fighting. They took him as arbiter, and he put them off till the next day."[^hyg23-arbiter]

Arete warned [Jason](jason.md) of her husband's planned judgment: "When Arete asked him what judgment he would give, Alcinous replied that if Medea were a virgin, he would give her to her father, but if not, to her husband. When Arete heard this from her husband, she sent word to Jason, and he lay with Medea by night in a cave."[^hyg23-arete] After the judgment favored Jason, "Absyrtus, fearing his father's commands, pursued them to the island of [Minerva](../deities/athena.md). When Jason was sacrificing there to Minerva, and Absyrtus came upon him, he was killed by Jason."[^hyg23-death]

[^hyg23-location]: "When Aeetes knew that Medea had fled with Jason, he made ready a ship and sent Absyrtus, his son, with armed guards after her. When he had caught up with her in the Adriatic Sea in Histria at King Alcinous' court" (Fabulae §23, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg23-arbiter]: "and would fight for her, Alcinous intervened to prevent their fighting. They took him as arbiter, and he put them off till the next day" (Fabulae §23, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg23-arete]: "When Arete asked him what judgment he would give, Alcinous replied that if Medea were a virgin, he would give her to her father, but if not, to her husband. When Arete heard this from her husband, she sent word to Jason, and he lay with Medea by night in a cave" (Fabulae §23, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg23-death]: "Nevertheless, when they had left, Absyrtus, fearing his father's commands, pursued them to the island of Minerva. When Jason was sacrificing there to Minerva, and Absyrtus came upon him, he was killed by Jason. Medea gave him burial" (Fabulae §23, trans. Mary Grant)

### The Daughters of Pelias (§24-25)

Medea's revenge on Pelias is described with the detail that she disguised herself "in the guise of a priestess of [Diana](../deities/artemis.md)" and promised to rejuvenate Pelias.[^hyg24-priestess] She demonstrated with "an old ram in a brazen vessel, from which a very fine young lamb seemed to spring."[^hyg24-demonstration]

The daughters are named: "Alcestis, Pelopia, Medusa, Pisidice, and Hippothoe."[^hyg24-daughters] After they killed their father, Jason "handed over the rule to Acastus, son of Pelias, brother of the Peliades, because he had gone with him to Colchis. He himself with Medea departed for Corinth."[^hyg24-corinth]

At Corinth, the Fabulae names their sons as "Mermerus and Pheres" and explains Jason's remarriage: "it was cast in his teeth that a man so brave and handsome and noble should have as wife a foreigner and sorceress. To him, Creon, son of Menoeceus, King of Corinth, gave his younger daughter Glauce as wife."[^hyg25-glauce] Medea's revenge was swift: "she made a golden crown, and she bade her sons give it as a gift to their stepmother. Creusa took the gift, and was burned to death along with Jason and Creon."[^hyg25-crown] This account uniquely claims Jason himself died in the fire, contradicting other traditions. "When Medea saw that the palace was on fire, she slew Mermerus and Pheres, her sons by Jason, and fled from Corinth."[^hyg25-infanticide]

[^hyg24-priestess]: "And so, when they were now far from Colchis, she bade the ship be hidden in a secret place, and she herself in the guise of a priestess of Diana came to the daughters of Pelias" (Fabulae §24, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg24-demonstration]: "In order more easily to bend her to her will, Medea cast mist before them, and by means of drugs formed many strange things which seemed to be like reality, putting an old ram in a brazen vessel, from which a very fine young lamb seemed to spring" (Fabulae §24, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg24-daughters]: "So in the same way the daughters of Pelias — namely, Alcestis, Pelopia, Medusa, Pisidice, and Hippothoe — at Medea's instigation slew their father and cooked him in a brazen caldron" (Fabulae §24, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg24-corinth]: "But Jason, at a given signal of Medea, made himself the master of the palace, and handed over the rule to Acastus, son of Pelias, brother of the Peliades, because he had gone with him to Colchis. He himself with Medea departed for Corinth" (Fabulae §24, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg25-glauce]: "When Medea, daughter of Aeetes and Idyia, had already borne to Jason sons — Mermerus and Pheres — and they were living in great harmony, it was cast in his teeth that a man so brave and handsome and noble should have as wife a foreigner and sorceress. To him, Creon, son of Menoeceus, King of Corinth, gave his younger daughter Glauce as wife" (Fabulae §25, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg25-crown]: "When Medea saw that she, who had been Jason's benefactress, was treated with scorn, with the help of poisonous drugs she made a golden crown, and she bade her sons give it as a gift to their stepmother. Creusa took the gift, and was burned to death along with Jason and Creon" (Fabulae §25, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg25-infanticide]: "When Medea saw that the palace was on fire, she slew Mermerus and Pheres, her sons by Jason, and fled from Corinth" (Fabulae §25, trans. Mary Grant)

### Exile to Athens (§26)

The Fabulae gives a different reason for Medea's exile from Athens: "Medea, an exile from Corinth, came to Athens to the hospitality of Aegeus, son of Pandion, and married him; to him Medus was born. Later the priestess of [Diana](../deities/artemis.md) began to censure Medea, and tell the king that she could not perform sacrifices piously because there was a woman in that state who was a sorceress and criminal. She was exiled then for the second time."[^hyg26-exile]

On her journey back to Colchis, she stopped "at Absoros where her brother Absyrtus was buried. There the people of Absoros could not cope with a great number of snakes. At their entreaties Medea gathered them up and put them in her brother's tomb. They still remain there, and if any goes outside the tomb, it pays the debt to nature."[^hyg26-snakes]

[^hyg26-exile]: "Medea, an exile from Corinth, came to Athens to the hospitality of Aegeus, son of Pandion, and married him; to him Medus was born. Later the priestess of Diana began to censure Medea, and tell the king that she could not perform sacrifices piously because there was a woman in that state who was a sorceress and criminal. She was exiled then for the second time" (Fabulae §26, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg26-snakes]: "Medea, however, with her yoked dragons, returned to Colchis from Athens. On the way she came to Absoros where her brother Absyrtus was buried. There the people of Absoros could not cope with a great number of snakes. At their entreaties Medea gathered them up and put them in her brother's tomb. They still remain there, and if any goes outside the tomb, it pays the debt to nature" (Fabulae §26, trans. Mary Grant)

### Medus (§27)

The story of Medus in Colchis involves elaborate deception. When Medus was brought by storm to King Perses (who had an oracle warning "to beware of death from Aeetes' descendants"), he "falsely asserted he was Hippotes, son of Creon."[^hyg27-false] Medea arrived separately "in her chariot with the yoked dragons" claiming to be "a priestess of [Diana](../deities/artemis.md)."[^hyg27-priestess]

Not recognizing her own son, she "persuaded the king that he was not Hippotes, but Medus, son of Aegeus, sent by his father to dispatch the king, and begged that he be handed over to her to kill, convinced that he was Hippotes."[^hyg27-mistake] When she discovered the truth, "she gave him a sword, and bade him avenge the wrongs of his grandfather. Medus, at this news, killed Perses, and gained his grandfather's kingdom; from his name he called the country Media."[^hyg27-revenge]

[^hyg27-false]: "Medus, following his mother, was brought to him by a storm, and guards seized him and brought him to King Perses. When Medus, son of Aegeus and Medea, saw that he had come into the power of his enemy, he falsely asserted he was Hippotes, son of Creon" (Fabulae §27, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg27-priestess]: "When Medea had come there in her chariot with the yoked dragons, she falsely claimed before the king to be a priestess of Diana. She said she could make atonement for the sterility" (Fabulae §27, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg27-mistake]: "And so when Medus was brought out to pay for his deceit by death, when she saw that things were otherwise than she had thought, she said she wished to talk with him, and gave him a sword, and bade him avenge the wrongs of his grandfather" (Fabulae §27, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg27-revenge]: "Medus, at this news, killed Perses, and gained his grandfather's kingdom; from his name he called the country Media" (Fabulae §27, trans. Mary Grant)

## In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md)

### Medea's Love for Jason (7.1-99)

Ovid gives Medea the longest interior monologue in Book VII. At the sight of [Jason](jason.md), she is torn between duty to her father and her consuming passion: "I see a better course and I approve, but follow its defeat."[^met-medea-1] She debates whether to help the stranger, arguing with herself about betrayal and desire, until seeing Jason again at [Hecate](../deities/hecate.md)'s altar reignites her love: "her frenzy so prevailed, she was convinced that he was not a mortal."[^met-medea-2] She gives him the magic herbs and he swears fidelity "by the goddess of the triple form."[^met-medea-3]

### The Trials and the Fleece (7.100-158)

When the earth-born warriors threaten Jason, Medea is "struck with sudden panic" and "chilled with fear she wilted to the ground," adding incantations to protect him.[^met-medea-4] After his victory she longs to embrace him but holds back, "careful of her good name," and rejoices "in deep, silent love."[^met-medea-5]

### Rejuvenation of Aeson (7.159-293)

Medea's greatest magical feat is the restoration of [Jason](jason.md)'s father Aeson to youth. She invokes [Hecate](../deities/hecate.md), the Moon, and the Earth in an extraordinary incantation: "I speak—and the wild, troubled sea is calm, and I command the waters to arise! The clouds I scatter—and I bring the clouds."[^met-medea-6] Flying through the sky in a dragon-drawn chariot, she gathers herbs for nine days and nights. She cuts old Aeson's throat and fills "his ancient veins with rich elixir," restoring him to the vigor of forty years past.[^met-medea-7]

### The Murder of Pelias (7.297-349)

Medea feigns a quarrel with Jason and flees to Pelias, where she wins the trust of his daughters by demonstrating how she can turn an old ram into a lamb. She then tricks the daughters into cutting their father's throat and boiling him — but this time uses herbs "of no potency." The daughters, each averting her eyes, "blindly struck him with their cruel hands."[^met-medea-8]

### Flight and Corinth (7.350-424)

Medea escapes on her winged dragons, flying over many lands (Ovid lists a catalogue of mythological sites). At Corinth, "the new wife had been burnt by the Colchian witchcraft and two seas had seen the king's own palace all aflame, then, savagely she drew her sword, and bathed it in the blood of her own infant sons."[^met-medea-9] She flees to Athens, where she marries Aegeus and attempts to poison [Theseus](theseus.md) with aconite, but Aegeus recognizes his son's sword and dashes the cup away. "Medea suddenly escaped from death, in a dark whirlwind her witch-singing raised."[^met-medea-10]

[^met-medea-1]: "I see a better course and I approve, but follow its defeat" (Metamorphoses 7.17-18, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-medea-2]: "her frenzy so prevailed, she was convinced that he was not a mortal" (Metamorphoses 7.85-86, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-medea-3]: "by the goddess of the triple form, Diana, Trivia, or Luna called, and by her sacred groves and fanes, he vowed" (Metamorphoses 7.94-96, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-medea-4]: "struck with sudden panic, she turned ashen white, her bloodless cheeks were blanched; and chilled with fear she wilted to the ground" (Metamorphoses 7.131-134, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-medea-5]: "careful of her good name, held aloof,—rejoicing in deep, silent love" (Metamorphoses 7.144-146, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-medea-6]: "I speak—and the wild, troubled sea is calm, and I command the waters to arise! The clouds I scatter—and I bring the clouds" (Metamorphoses 7.200-202, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-medea-7]: "his beard and hair no longer white with age, turned quickly to their natural vigor, dark and lustrous; and his wasted form renewed, appeared in all the vigor of bright youth" (Metamorphoses 7.285-289, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-medea-8]: "every face averted so, they blindly struck him with their cruel hands" (Metamorphoses 7.330-331, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-medea-9]: "the new wife had been burnt by the Colchian witchcraft and two seas had seen the king's own palace all aflame, then, savagely she drew her sword, and bathed it in the blood of her own infant sons" (Metamorphoses 7.394-398, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-medea-10]: "Medea suddenly escaped from death, in a dark whirlwind her witch-singing raised" (Metamorphoses 7.424, trans. Brookes More)
