## Overview

**Medea** is a sorceress, daughter of Aeetes (king of Colchis, son of [Helius](../deities/helius.md)) and Idyia (daughter of [Oceanus](../deities/oceanus.md)). Her story in the [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) spans from her love for [Jason](jason.md) in Colchis to her return to her father's kingdom.

## In the Bibliotheca

### Helping Jason at Colchis

When [Jason](jason.md) was charged with yoking the brazen-footed fire-breathing bulls, "Medea conceived a passion for him; now she was a witch, daughter of Aeetes and Idyia, daughter of Ocean."[^apd-passion] She promised to help him "if he would swear to have her to wife and would take her with him on the voyage to Greece."[^apd-oath]

She gave him a drug rendering him immune to fire and iron for a day, and told him how to defeat the armed men that would spring from the dragon's teeth: "when he saw a knot of them he was to throw stones into their midst from a distance, and when they fought each other about that, he was taken to kill them."[^apd-stones]

After Aeetes refused to surrender the fleece, Medea "brought Jason by night to the fleece, and having lulled to sleep by her drugs the dragon that guarded it, she possessed herself of the fleece."[^apd-dragon]

[^apd-passion]: "Medea conceived a passion for him; now she was a witch, daughter of Aeetes and Idyia, daughter of Ocean" (Bibliotheca 1.9.23, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-oath]: "she, keeping the thing from her father, promised to help him to yoke the bulls and to deliver to him the fleece, if he would swear to have her to wife and would take her with him on the voyage to Greece" (Bibliotheca 1.9.23, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-stones]: "when he saw a knot of them he was to throw stones into their midst from a distance, and when they fought each other about that, he was taken to kill them" (Bibliotheca 1.9.23, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-dragon]: "Medea brought Jason by night to the fleece, and having lulled to sleep by her drugs the dragon that guarded it, she possessed herself of the fleece and in Jason's company came to the Argo" (Bibliotheca 1.9.23, trans. Frazer)

### Murder of Apsyrtus

When Aeetes pursued the Argo, "Medea murdered her brother and cutting him limb from limb threw the pieces into the deep. Gathering the child's limbs, Aeetes fell behind in the pursuit; wherefore he turned back, and, having buried the rescued limbs of his child, he called the place Tomi."[^apd-apsyrtus]

[^apd-apsyrtus]: "Medea murdered her brother and cutting him limb from limb threw the pieces into the deep. Gathering the child's limbs, Aeetes fell behind in the pursuit; wherefore he turned back, and, having buried the rescued limbs of his child, he called the place Tomi" (Bibliotheca 1.9.24, trans. Frazer)

### Purification and the Return

[Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) sent a storm in anger at the murder, and the Argo itself spoke, saying the wrath would not cease unless they were purified by [Circe](../deities/circe.md). They sailed to Aeaea, "where they supplicated Circe and were purified."[^apd-circe]

At Corcyra, when the Colchians demanded Medea back, King Alcinous declared "that if she already knew Jason, he would give her to him, but that if she were still a maid he would send her away to her father." His wife Arete "anticipated matters by marrying Medea to Jason."[^apd-alcinous]

On Crete, the brazen man Talos guarded the island. "His death was brought about by the wiles of Medea, whether, as some say, she drove him mad by drugs, or, as others say, she promised to make him immortal and then drew out the nail, so that all the ichor gushed out and he died."[^apd-talos]

[^apd-circe]: "they skirted Tyrrhenia and came to Aeaea, where they supplicated Circe and were purified" (Bibliotheca 1.9.24, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-alcinous]: "if she already knew Jason, he would give her to him, but that if she were still a maid he would send her away to her father. However, Arete, wife of Alcinous, anticipated matters by marrying Medea to Jason" (Bibliotheca 1.9.25, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-talos]: "His death was brought about by the wiles of Medea, whether, as some say, she drove him mad by drugs, or, as others say, she promised to make him immortal and then drew out the nail, so that all the ichor gushed out and he died" (Bibliotheca 1.9.26, trans. Frazer)

### Killing Pelias

At Iolcus, Medea "repaired to the palace of Pelias and persuaded his daughters to make mince meat of their father and boil him, promising to make him young again by her drugs; and to win their confidence she cut up a ram and made it into a lamb by boiling it. So they believed her, made mince meat of their father and boiled him."[^apd-pelias]

[^apd-pelias]: "she repaired to the palace of Pelias and persuaded his daughters to make mince meat of their father and boil him, promising to make him young again by her drugs; and to win their confidence she cut up a ram and made it into a lamb by boiling it. So they believed her, made mince meat of their father and boiled him" (Bibliotheca 1.9.27, trans. Frazer)

### At Corinth

After ten years in Corinth, Jason divorced Medea and married Glauce, daughter of King Creon. Medea "invoked the gods by whom Jason had sworn, and after often upbraiding him with his ingratitude she sent the bride a robe steeped in poison, which when Glauce had put on, she was consumed with fierce fire along with her father, who went to her rescue."[^apd-glauce]

She then killed her own children: "Mermerus and Pheres, the children whom Medea had by Jason, she killed." She escaped on "a car drawn by winged dragons" given to her by [Helius](../deities/helius.md).[^apd-infanticide]

> **VARIANT:** "Another tradition is that on her flight she left behind her children, who were still infants, setting them as suppliants on the altar of Hera of the Height; but the Corinthians removed them and wounded them to death."[^apd-variant]

[^apd-glauce]: "she sent the bride a robe steeped in poison, which when Glauce had put on, she was consumed with fierce fire along with her father, who went to her rescue" (Bibliotheca 1.9.28, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-infanticide]: "Mermerus and Pheres, the children whom Medea had by Jason, she killed, and having got from the Sun a car drawn by winged dragons she fled on it to Athens" (Bibliotheca 1.9.28, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-variant]: "Another tradition is that on her flight she left behind her children, who were still infants, setting them as suppliants on the altar of Hera of the Height; but the Corinthians removed them and wounded them to death" (Bibliotheca 1.9.28, trans. Frazer)

### At Athens and After

"Medea came to Athens, and being there married to Aegeus bore him a son Medus." She later plotted against Theseus and "was driven a fugitive from Athens with her son." Medus "conquered many barbarians and called the whole country under him Media, and marching against the Indians he met his death."[^apd-athens]

Finally, "Medea came unknown to Colchis, and finding that Aeetes had been deposed by his brother Perses, she killed Perses and restored the kingdom to her father."[^apd-colchis]

[^apd-athens]: "Medea came to Athens, and being there married to Aegeus bore him a son Medus. Afterwards, however, plotting against Theseus, she was driven a fugitive from Athens with her son. But he conquered many barbarians and called the whole country under him Media" (Bibliotheca 1.9.28, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-colchis]: "Medea came unknown to Colchis, and finding that Aeetes had been deposed by his brother Perses, she killed Perses and restored the kingdom to her father" (Bibliotheca 1.9.28, trans. Frazer)
