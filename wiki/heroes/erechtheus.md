## Overview

**Erechtheus** was king of Athens, son of [Pandion I](pandion.md). When Pandion died, Erechtheus took the kingdom while his twin brother Butes received the priesthood. His reign was marked by war with the Eleusinians, in which he sacrificed his youngest daughter on the oracle's instruction — an act that also led his other daughters to kill themselves. He slew the Eleusinian champion Eumolpus, but [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md), Eumolpus's grandfather, destroyed Erechtheus and his house in revenge.

Note: The [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) and [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) use the name "Erechtheus" for a figure who in Apollodorus is called [Erichthonius](erichthonius.md). The two names were sometimes conflated in the tradition.

## In the [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md)

### Division of the Kingdom (3.15.1)

When [Pandion I](pandion.md) died, his twin sons divided the inheritance: "Erechtheus got the kingdom, and Butes got the priesthood of Athena and Poseidon Erechtheus."[^apd-erech-division]

### Family (3.15.1)

Erechtheus married Praxithea, daughter of Phrasimus by Diogenia, daughter of Cephisus. His sons were Cecrops (II), Pandorus, and Metion. His daughters were Procris, Creusa, Chthonia, and Orithyia.[^apd-erech-family]

Of these: Chthonia married Butes (Erechtheus's own brother); Creusa married Xuthus; Procris married Cephalus, son of Deion; Orithyia was carried off by Boreas.[^apd-erech-marriages]

### Procris and Cephalus (3.15.1)

Procris's marriage ended badly. Bribed by a golden crown, she admitted Pteleon to her bed and was detected by Cephalus. She fled to [Minos](minos.md), who fell in love with her and tried to seduce her. Minos was dangerous to his lovers: [Pasiphae](../deities/pasiphae.md) had bewitched him so that "whenever he took another woman to his bed, he discharged wild beasts at her joints, and so the women perished."[^apd-erech-minos] Procris protected herself by giving Minos the Circaean root to drink before sharing his bed, and received from him "a swift dog and a dart that flew straight."[^apd-erech-procris-gifts] Fearing Minos's wife, she returned to Athens, reconciled with Cephalus, and went hunting with him. In the thicket, Cephalus threw his dart without knowing she was there, hit and killed her, and was condemned to perpetual banishment by the Areopagus.[^apd-erech-procris-death]

### Orithyia and Boreas (3.15.2)

While Orithyia was playing by the Ilissus river, Boreas carried her off. By him she bore daughters Cleopatra and Chione, and winged sons Zetes and Calais. The sons sailed with Jason; they met their end chasing the Harpies, or — according to Acusilaus — were killed by Heracles at Tenos.[^apd-erech-orithyia]

Cleopatra married Phineus, by whom she had sons Plexippus and Pandion. Phineus later married Idaea, who falsely accused her stepsons of corrupting her virtue; Phineus believed her and blinded them both. When the Argonauts sailed past with Boreas, they punished him.[^apd-erech-cleopatra]

### Chione, Eumolpus, and the War (3.15.4)

Chione had intercourse with [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) and, to conceal this from her father, threw the infant Eumolpus into the sea. Poseidon rescued him and gave him to his daughter Benthesicyme to raise in Ethiopia. After various misadventures — including being banished for attempting to force his wife's sister — Eumolpus eventually went to Eleusis and made friends with the Eleusinians.[^apd-erech-eumolpus]

War broke out between Athens and Eleusis. Eumolpus was called in by the Eleusinians "with a large force of Thracians." When Erechtheus consulted the oracle, "the god answered that they would win the war if he would slaughter one of his daughters; and when he slaughtered his youngest, the others also slaughtered themselves; for, as some said, they had taken an oath among themselves to perish together."[^apd-erech-sacrifice]

In the battle that followed, "Erechtheus killed Eumolpus."[^apd-erech-kills]

### Destruction (3.15.5)

"But Poseidon having destroyed Erechtheus and his house, Cecrops, the eldest of the sons of Erechtheus, succeeded to the throne."[^apd-erech-destroyed]

## In the Odyssey

In [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) Book VII, after guiding Odysseus through Phaeacia, Athena "departed over the unharvested seas, and left pleasant Scheria, and came to Marathon and wide-wayed Athens, and entered the good house of Erechtheus."[^od7-erech] This is a passing reference — Athena's destination after helping Odysseus, confirming her traditional association with Athens and with Erechtheus's house.
