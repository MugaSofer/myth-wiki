## Overview

**Philoctetes** was the son of Poeas and a warrior renowned for possessing the bow and arrows of [Heracles](heracles.md). During the Trojan War, he was bitten by a snake and abandoned on the island of [Lemnos](../places/lemnos.md), where he remained for ten years. When the Greeks learned that Troy could not be taken without his arrows, they retrieved him, and he shot and killed [Paris](paris.md), ending the siege.

## In the Bibliotheca

### Receiving Heracles' Bow

[Heracles](heracles.md), dying on Mount Oeta from the poison of Nessus, "proceeded to Mount Oeta, in the Trachinian territory, and there constructed a pyre, mounted it, and gave orders to kindle it. When no one would do so, Poeas, passing by to look for his flocks, set a light to it. On him Hercules bestowed his bow."[^apd-herc-pyre] Thus Philoctetes, as the son of Poeas, became heir to the most powerful weapon in the mythological world.

### Snakebite and Exile

When the Greek fleet was gathering at [Tenedos](../places/tenedos.md), Philoctetes was bitten by a serpent during a sacrifice to [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md). "As they were offering a sacrifice to Apollo, a water-snake approached from the altar and bit Philoctetes; and as the sore did not heal and grew noisome, the army could not endure the stench, and Ulysses, by the orders of Agamemnon, put him ashore on the island of [Lemnos](../places/lemnos.md), with the bow of Hercules which he had in his possession; and there, by shooting birds with the bow, he subsisted in the wilderness."[^apd-epd-bite]

### Recovery and the Fall of Troy

After nine years of war, Calchas prophesied that "Troy could not be taken unless they had the bow and arrows of Hercules fighting on their side." [Ulysses](odysseus.md) and [Diomedes](diomedes.md) traveled to [Lemnos](../places/lemnos.md) and, "having by craft got possession of the bow and arrows he persuaded him to sail to Troy. So he went, and after being cured by Podalirius, he shot Alexander."[^apd-epd-troy] With [Paris](paris.md) (Alexander) killed by Philoctetes' arrow, the Trojans' greatest protector was gone, and Troy's fall soon followed.

## In the Fabulae

[Hyginus](../sources/hyginus.md) provides additional context for the snakebite. He attributes it to divine punishment: "When Philoctetes, son of Poeas and Demonassa, was on the island of Lemnos, a snake struck his foot. Juno had sent it, angry with him because he alone rather than the others had dared to build the funeral pyre of Hercules when his human body was consumed and he was raised to immortality."[^hyg-bite] Despite this wound being inflicted as punishment, Hercules rewarded his piety with the gift of the bow: "Because of the favour Hercules gave him his marvellous arrows."[^hyg-favour]

When the Achaeans could not endure the wound's stench, "by Agamemnon's order he was left on Lemnos together with the marvellous arrows. A shepherd of King Actor, named Iphimachus, son of Dolops, cared for the abandoned man."[^hyg-care] Later, when an oracle revealed that "Troy could not be taken without the arrows of Hercules," the Greeks sent envoys. "Then Agamemnon sent Ulysses and Diomede as scouts to visit him. They persuaded him to be reconciled and to help in attacking Troy, and took him off with them."[^hyg-persuade]

In the war, "Philoctetes with Alexander; Alexander was killed."[^hyg-combat] This single combat decided the fate of Troy.

[^apd-herc-pyre]: "he proceeded to Mount Oeta, in the Trachinian territory, and there constructed a pyre, mounted it, and gave orders to kindle it. When no one would do so, Poeas, passing by to look for his flocks, set a light to it. On him Hercules bestowed his bow" (Bibliotheca 2.7.7, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-epd-bite]: "as they were offering a sacrifice to Apollo, a water-snake approached from the altar and bit Philoctetes; and as the sore did not heal and grew noisome, the army could not endure the stench, and Ulysses, by the orders of Agamemnon, put him ashore on the island of Lemnos, with the bow of Hercules which he had in his possession; and there, by shooting birds with the bow, he subsisted in the wilderness" (Bibliotheca, Epitome 3.27, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-epd-troy]: "Ulysses went with Diomedes to Philoctetes in Lemnos, and having by craft got possession of the bow and arrows he persuaded him to sail to Troy. So he went, and after being cured by Podalirius, he shot Alexander" (Bibliotheca, Epitome 5.8, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^hyg-bite]: "When Philoctetes, son of Poeas and Demonassa, was on the island of Lemnos, a snake struck his foot.

## In the Posthomerica

### Retrieval from Lemnos

When [Calchas](calchas.md) prophesied that Troy could not fall without Philoctetes' aid, the sons of Atreus sent [Odysseus](odysseus.md) and [Diomedes](diomedes.md) to [Lemnos](../places/lemnos.md) to retrieve him. The two heroes found him in a cave in a wretched state: "Horror came on them / When they beheld the hero of their quest / Groaning with bitter pangs, on the hard earth / Lying, with many feathers round him strewn."[^post-found] His body had been utterly consumed by years of suffering: "all his frame was wasted: naught but skin / Covered his bones. Unwashen there he crouched / With famine-haggard cheeks, with sunken eyes / Glaring his misery 'neath cavernous brows."[^post-wasted] The wound itself was graphically described: "the ulcerous black wound, eating to the bone, / Festered with thrills of agonizing pain."[^post-wound] Beside him lay [Heracles'](heracles.md) great bow and a quiver of arrows smeared with the venom of the water-snake that had bit him.

When Philoctetes saw the two men approach he seized his bow in fury, ready to shoot — but [Athena](../deities/athena.md) dissolved his rage: "even as upon that godlike twain / He gazed, Athena caused his bitter wrath / To melt away."[^post-athena] Odysseus and Diomedes persuaded him to return, promising he would be healed. They carried him to the ship and departed with Athena sending a favoring wind.

### Healing and Reconciliation

Upon arriving at the Greek camp, [Podaleirius](podaleirius.md) healed him on the spot: "Swifter than thought he made him whole and sound; / For deftly on the wound he spread his salves, / Calling on his physician-father's name."[^post-healing] The transformation was immediate — health and strength returned and "Over the bloodless face the flush of health / Glowed, and for wretched weakness mighty strength / Thrilled through him: goodly and great waxed all his limbs."[^post-restored]

[Agamemnon](agamemnon.md) then made a formal apology, conceding that the abandonment had been wrong and offering gifts: "Dear friend, since by the will of Heaven our souls / Were once perverted, that in sea-girt Lemnos / We left thee, harbour not thine heart within / Fierce wrath for this."[^post-apology] He offered seven handmaids, forty swift horses, and twelve tripods. Philoctetes forgave him freely: "Friend, I forgive thee freely, and all beside / Whoso against me haply hath transgressed. / I know how good men's minds sometimes be warped: / Nor meet it is that one be obdurate / Ever, and nurse mean rancours."[^post-forgive]

### Killing Paris

The next day Philoctetes returned to battle clad in Heracles' arms, which were elaborately decorated with mythological scenes wrought by Hephaestus — wild beasts on the belt, and on the quiver the slaying of Argus by Hermes, Phaethon's fall, Perseus killing Medusa, and Prometheus chained on Caucasus: "All these Hephaestus' cunning hands had wrought / For Hercules; and these to Poeas' son, / Most near of friends and dear, he gave to bear."[^post-arms]

[Paris](paris.md) challenged him with his bow. Paris's arrow missed Philoctetes by a hair's breadth and instead struck and killed a nearby warrior named Cleodorus. Philoctetes then shot back: the first arrow merely grazed Paris's wrist. His second shot found its mark: "the barbed shaft of Poeas' son had plunged, / Ere he could swerve, 'twixt flank and groin."[^post-paris] Paris fled the field and sought out the nymph Oenone on Mount Ida, who refused to heal him. He died of the wound.

### Attack on Aeneas (Book XI)

During the assault on Troy's walls, Philoctetes shot at [Aeneas](../deities/aeneas.md) on the battlements. The arrow was turned aside by [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md) and her shield, deflecting it onto a nearby warrior named Medon instead, who fell from the tower.[^post-aeneas] Aeneas responded by hurling a stone that killed Philoctetes' companion Toxaechmes. Philoctetes taunted Aeneas to come out and fight him in the open: "Aeneas, thou, forsooth, dost deem thyself / A mighty champion, fighting from a tower / Whence craven women war with foes! / Now if / Thou be a man, come forth without the wall / In battle-harness, and so learn to know / In spear-craft and in bow-craft Poeas' son!"[^post-taunt] Aeneas did not answer the challenge.

### The Wooden Horse

When the stratagem of the Wooden Horse was proposed, Philoctetes and [Neoptolemus](neoptolemus.md) were the only leaders who refused, both still hungry for open battle: "Save twain, fierce-hearted Neoptolemus / And Philoctetes mighty-souled; for these / Still were insatiate for the bitter fray."[^post-horse] They pressed forward against the walls independently, and might have taken Troy by themselves, but Zeus intervened with a thunderbolt: "from the sky Zeus showed his wrath; he shook / The earth beneath their feet, and all the air / Shuddered, as down before those heroes twain / He hurled his thunderbolt."[^post-zeus] Compelled by the sign, they fell in with Calchas's counsel and joined the ruse. Philoctetes is listed among the warriors who entered the Horse.[^post-horse-enter]
