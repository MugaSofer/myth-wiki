## Overview

**Philoctetes** was the son of Poeas and a warrior renowned for possessing the bow and arrows of [Heracles](heracles.md). During the Trojan War, he was bitten by a snake and abandoned on the island of [Lemnos](../places/lemnos.md), where he remained for ten years. When the Greeks learned that Troy could not be taken without his arrows, they retrieved him, and he shot and killed [Paris](paris.md), ending the siege.

## In the Bibliotheca

### Receiving Heracles' Bow

[Heracles](heracles.md), dying on Mount Oeta from the poison of Nessus, "proceeded to Mount Oeta, in the Trachinian territory, and there constructed a pyre, mounted it, and gave orders to kindle it. When no one would do so, Poeas, passing by to look for his flocks, set a light to it. On him Hercules bestowed his bow."[^apd-herc-pyre] Thus Philoctetes, as the son of Poeas, became heir to the most powerful weapon in the mythological world.

### Snakebite and Exile

When the Greek fleet was gathering at [Tenedos](../places/tenedos.md), Philoctetes was bitten by a serpent during a sacrifice to [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md). "As they were offering a sacrifice to Apollo, a water-snake approached from the altar and bit Philoctetes; and as the sore did not heal and grew noisome, the army could not endure the stench, and Ulysses, by the orders of Agamemnon, put him ashore on the island of [Lemnos](../places/lemnos.md), with the bow of Hercules which he had in his possession; and there, by shooting birds with the bow, he subsisted in the wilderness."[^apd-epd-bite]

### Recovery and the Fall of Troy

After nine years of war, Calchas prophesied that "Troy could not be taken unless they had the bow and arrows of Hercules fighting on their side." [Ulysses](odysseus.md) and [Diomedes](diomedes.md) traveled to [Lemnos](../places/lemnos.md) and, "having by craft got possession of the bow and arrows he persuaded him to sail to Troy. So he went, and after being cured by Podalirius, he shot Alexander."[^apd-epd-troy] With [Paris](paris.md) (Alexander) killed by Philoctetes' arrow, the Trojans' greatest protector was gone, and Troy's fall soon followed.

## In the Fabulae

[Hyginus](../sources/hyginus.md) provides additional context for the snakebite. He attributes it to divine punishment: "When Philoctetes, son of Poeas and Demonassa, was on the island of Lemnos, a snake struck his foot. Juno had sent it, angry with him because he alone rather than the others had dared to build the funeral pyre of Hercules when his human body was consumed and he was raised to immortality."[^hyg-bite] Despite this wound being inflicted as punishment, Hercules rewarded his piety with the gift of the bow: "Because of the favour Hercules gave him his marvellous arrows."[^hyg-favour]

When the Achaeans could not endure the wound's stench, "by Agamemnon's order he was left on Lemnos together with the marvellous arrows. A shepherd of King Actor, named Iphimachus, son of Dolops, cared for the abandoned man."[^hyg-care] Later, when an oracle revealed that "Troy could not be taken without the arrows of Hercules," the Greeks sent envoys. "Then Agamemnon sent Ulysses and Diomede as scouts to visit him. They persuaded him to be reconciled and to help in attacking Troy, and took him off with them."[^hyg-persuade]

In the war, "Philoctetes with Alexander; Alexander was killed."[^hyg-combat] This single combat decided the fate of Troy.
