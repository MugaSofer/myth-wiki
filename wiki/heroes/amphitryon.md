## Overview

**Amphitryon** was a Mycenaean nobleman and the mortal husband of [Alcmena](alcmena.md), a woman who also bore [Heracles](heracles.md) to [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md). Amphitryon served as [Heracles](heracles.md)' foster-father and trainer, teaching him warfare and the skills of a hero, though he remained unaware at first that his wife had conceived a son by the king of the gods.

## In the Bibliotheca

Amphitryon was the son of [Alcaeus](alcaeus.md), who himself was the son of the great hero [Perseus](perseus.md). After the death of [Electryon](electryon.md), "Amphitryon ransomed them from Polyxenus and brought them to Mycenae. Wishing to avenge his sons' death, Electryon purposed to make war on the Teleboans, but first he committed the kingdom to Amphitryon along with his daughter Alcmena, binding him by oath to keep her a virgin until his return."[^apd-guardianship]

### Accidental Death of Electryon

When Amphitryon received the cattle back, "one of them charged, and Amphitryon threw at her the club which he had in his hands. But the club rebounded from the cow's horns and striking Electryon's head killed him."[^apd-accident] This death gave [Sthenelus](sthenelus.md) pretext to banish him: "Hence Sthenelus laid hold of this pretext to banish Amphitryon from the whole of Argos, while he himself seized the throne of Mycenae and Tiryns."[^apd-exile]

### Exile to Thebes

"Amphitryon went with Alcmena and Licymnius to Thebes and was purified by Creon and gave his sister Perimede to Licymnius. And as Alcmena said she would marry him when he had avenged her brothers' death, Amphitryon engaged to do so, and undertook an expedition against the Teleboans, and invited Creon to assist him."[^apd-thebes]

To accomplish the task, Amphitryon sought aid from [Cephalus](cephalus.md): "Amphitryon betook him to Cephalus, son of Deioneus, at Athens, and persuaded him, in return for a share of the Teleboan spoils, to bring to the chase the dog which Procris had brought from Crete as a gift from Minos; for that dog was destined to catch whatever it pursued."[^apd-cephalus] With allies secured, "Amphitryon ravaged the islands of the Taphians. Now, so long as Pterelaus lived, he could not take Taphos; but when Comaetho, daughter of Pterelaus, falling in love with Amphitryon, pulled out the golden hair from her father's head, Pterelaus died, and Amphitryon subjugated all the islands."[^apd-victory]

### The Birth of Heracles

"But before Amphitryon reached Thebes, Zeus came by night and prolonging the one night threefold he assumed the likeness of Amphitryon and bedded with Alcmena and related what had happened concerning the Teleboans. But when Amphitryon arrived and saw that he was not welcomed by his wife, he inquired the cause; and when she told him that he had come the night before and slept with her, he learned from Tiresias how Zeus had enjoyed her."[^apd-zeus]

Amphitryon then raised [Heracles](heracles.md) as his own son: "Alcmena bore two sons, to wit, Hercules, whom she had by Zeus and who was the elder by one night, and Iphicles, whom she had by Amphitryon."[^apd-twins] When the infant [Heracles](heracles.md) was threatened by serpents sent by [Hera](../deities/hera.md), "Alcmena called Amphitryon to her help, but Hercules arose and killed the serpents by strangling them with both his hands. However, Pherecydes says that it was Amphitryon who put the serpents in the bed, because he would know which of the two children was his, and that when Iphicles fled, and Hercules stood his ground, he knew that Iphicles was begotten of his body."[^apd-serpents]

### Heracles' Education and Death

"Hercules was taught to drive a chariot by Amphitryon, to wrestle by Autolycus, to shoot with the bow by Eurytus, to fence by Castor, and to play the lyre by Linus."[^apd-education] During a conflict with Thebes, "in the fight Amphitryon fell fighting bravely."[^apd-death] After his death, "[Rhadamanthys](rhadamanthys.md), son of Zeus, married Alcmena... and dwelt as an exile at Ocaleae in Boeotia."[^apd-remarriage]

## In Euripides' [Heracles](../sources/euripides-heracles.md)

Amphitryon has a major role in the [Heracles](../sources/euripides-heracles.md). He narrates the prologue, explaining that [Heracles](heracles.md) descended to [Hades](../deities/hades.md) to fetch [Cerberus](../creatures/cerberus.md) and has not returned, while the usurper Lycus threatens to kill the family.

When Lycus contemptuously dismisses Heracles as merely an archer, Amphitryon delivers a passionate defence of archery as the wisest form of warfare: the archer "stands secure from death" and fights at a distance, where "discretion in the battle's chance engagements is the truest valour."[^eur-her-archery]

After Heracles returns and kills Lycus, [Hera](../deities/hera.md) sends madness upon him. Amphitryon watches helplessly as Heracles murders Megara and the children. After [Athena](../deities/athena.md) stops the rampage with a hurled rock, Amphitryon reveals the truth to the awakened Heracles.

The play's emotional core includes a striking moment of paternity: Heracles addresses Amphitryon as his true father over [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) — "Yet, O let not this offend thine ear, old man, for thee, not Jove, I deem my real sire."[^eur-her-sire] At the end, Heracles bids farewell and asks Amphitryon to bury the children. Amphitryon asks "But who will bury me?" and Heracles promises to return from Athens to fetch him.[^eur-her-farewell]

[^eur-her-sire]: "Yet, O let not this offend thine ear, old man, for thee, not Jove, I deem my real sire" (Heracles ~1265, trans. Michael Wodhull)
[^eur-her-farewell]: "My children inter as I directed... But who will bury me?... I'll fetch thee from Thebes to Athens" (Heracles ~1420, trans. Michael Wodhull)
