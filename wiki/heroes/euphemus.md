## Overview

**Euphemus** was an Argonaut, son of [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) and Europe (daughter of Tityos), and the swiftest-footed man alive. His divine parentage gave him the ability to run across the surface of the sea without sinking, touching the water only at the tips of his toes. He joined the voyage of the [Argo](../objects/argo.md) from Taenarus. He played a key role at the Symplegades by releasing the dove that tested the passage, and later received a clod of Libyan earth from the god [Triton](../deities/poseidon.md) — a gift that, in a prophetic dream, foretold the founding of the island Calliste (later Thera) by his descendants.

## Powers

Euphemus's defining ability was running on water: "He was wont to skim the swell of the grey sea, and wetted not his swift feet, but just dipping the tips of his toes was borne on the watery path."[^arg1-water] This capacity for superhuman speed is attributed to his descent from [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md).

## In the Argonautica

### Joining the Expedition (Book I)

Euphemus came to the muster from Taenarus, described as "most swift-footed of men."[^arg1-taenarus] He was the son of [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) by Europe, who was herself the daughter of mighty Tityos.[^arg1-parentage] After the benches were assigned by lot, the crew placed their trust in Tiphys as helmsman.[^arg1-helmsman]

When the crew feasted on the shore before departing and Jason fell into brooding despair, Idmon the seer read the omen of the sacrifice with good cheer. Euphemus and the others heard the seer's prophecy that the voyage would return successfully, though Idmon himself was fated to die in Asia.[^arg1-idmon]

### The Symplegades (Book II)

As the Argo approached the Clashing Rocks, Phineus had instructed the crew to test the passage with a dove. Euphemus was the one entrusted with carrying and releasing the bird:

> "nor did they forget to bear with them a trembling dove; but Euphemus seized her and brought her all quivering with fear, and they loosed the twin hawsers from the land."[^arg2-dove-seize]

As the Argo drove forward through the narrow strait, "Euphemus grasped the dove in his hand and started to mount the prow."[^arg2-prow] At the critical moment, "Euphemus sent forth the dove to dart forward in flight; and they all together raised their heads to look; but she flew between them, and the rocks again rushed together and crashed as they met face to face."[^arg2-dove-sent] The rocks sheared only the tip of the dove's tail feathers, and she escaped unharmed. Euphemus then cried to his comrades to row with all their might as the rocks parted again.[^arg2-euphemus-cry]

After safely passing through, Tiphys praised [Athena](../deities/athena.md)'s role in the ship's survival. Following the deaths of Idmon and Tiphys, when Ancaeus stepped forward to take the helm, Euphemus was among those who also started up eager to steer, though the others granted the place to Ancaeus.[^arg2-steer]

### The Search in Libya (Book IV)

After the Argo was swept to Libya and the heroes carried the ship overland to Lake Tritonis, a search party was sent to find [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md). Euphemus was one of those dispatched, "relying on his swift feet."[^arg4-search] He and the others returned empty-handed — only Lynceus thought he glimpsed Heracles in the far distance, a sight as uncertain as seeing the moon through cloud at the month's beginning.[^arg4-lynceus]

### The Gift of Triton and the Prophetic Dream (Book IV)

As the Argonauts sought a way out of Lake Tritonis, the god Triton appeared in the form of a youth and offered a clod of earth as a stranger's gift. Euphemus was the one who stepped forward to receive it: "Euphemus held out his hands towards the clod."[^arg4-clod] He asked Triton about the passage back to the sea, and Triton directed them.[^arg4-triton-reply]

Later, after the Argo had passed Crete and Anaphe, Euphemus recalled a dream of the night:

> "it seemed to him that the god-given clod of earth held in his palm close to his breast was being suckled by white streams of milk, and that from it, little though it was, grew a woman like a virgin; and he, overcome by strong desire, lay with her in love's embrace; and united with her he pitied her, as though she were a maiden whom he was feeding with his own milk."[^arg4-dream]

In the dream, the woman spoke to him: "Daughter of Triton am I, dear friend, and nurse of thy children, no maiden; Triton and Libya are my parents. But restore me to the daughters of Nereus to dwell in the sea near Anaphe; I shall return again to the light of the sun, to prepare a home for thy descendants."[^arg4-prophecy]

Euphemus told the dream to [Jason](../heroes/jason.md), who interpreted it as a prophecy from [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md): the clod, cast into the sea, would become an island where Euphemus's children's children would dwell, for Triton had given it as a stranger's gift from the Libyan mainland.[^arg4-jason-interp]

Acting on this interpretation, "Euphemus made not vain the answer of Aeson's son; but, cheered by the prophecy, he cast the clod into the depths. Therefrom rose up an island, Calliste, sacred nurse of the sons of Euphemus, who in former days dwelt in Sintian Lemnos, and from Lemnos were driven forth by Tyrrhenians and came to Sparta as suppliants; and when they left Sparta, Theras, the goodly son of Autesion, brought them to the island Calliste, and from himself he gave it the name of Thera."[^arg4-calliste]

Apollonius notes that this colonization "befell after the days of Euphemus."[^arg4-after]
