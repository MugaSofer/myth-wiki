## Overview

**Amphiaraus** was a renowned seer and warrior of [Argos](../places/argos.md). Though he possessed prophetic knowledge that all who joined the [Seven Against Thebes](../events/seven-against-thebes.md) except [Adrastus](adrastus.md) would perish, he was compelled to participate through the machinations of his wife [Eriphyle](eriphyle.md). His death—being swallowed by the earth while fleeing the battlefield—became his apotheosis, granted immortality by [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md).

## In the Bibliotheca

Amphiaraus is identified as "son of Oicles" and is listed among the great hunters gathered for the Calydonian boar hunt.[^apd-hunter] He married [Eriphyle](eriphyle.md), with whom he established an unusual compact: "once, when a difference arose between him and [Adrastus](adrastus.md), he had made it up with him and sworn to let Eriphyle decide any future dispute he might have with Adrastus."[^apd-oath]

### The War Against Thebes

As a seer, "Amphiaraus, son of Oicles, being a seer and foreseeing that all who joined in the expedition except Adrastus were destined to perish, shrank from it himself and discouraged the rest."[^apd-foreknowing] However, [Polynices](polyneices.md) circumvented his refusal by bribing [Eriphyle](eriphyle.md) with a magical necklace. [Eriphyle](eriphyle.md) "accepted the necklace and persuaded him to march with Adrastus. Thus forced to go to the war, Amphiaraus laid his commands on his sons, that, when they were grown up, they should slay their mother and march against Thebes."[^apd-compelled]

At Nemea, Amphiaraus distinguished himself: "they celebrated the Nemean games in his honor; and Adrastus won the horse race... Amphiaraus the leaping and quoit-throwing match."[^apd-games] At the gates of Thebes, "Amphiaraus... at the Proetidian [gate]" took his position.[^apd-gate]

### Death and Apotheosis

During the battle, "Amphiaraus hated Tydeus for thwarting him by persuading the Argives to march to Thebes; so when he perceived the intention of the goddess he cut off the head of Melanippus and gave it to Tydeus."[^apd-tydeus] As Amphiaraus fled beside the river Ismenus, "before Periclymenus could wound him in the back, Zeus cleft the earth by throwing a thunderbolt, and Amphiaraus vanished with his chariot and his charioteer Baton, or, as some say, Elato; and Zeus made him immortal."[^apd-death]
