## Overview

**Dido** is the founder and queen of Carthage. A Phoenician princess, daughter of Belus, she fled Tyre after her brother Pygmalion murdered her husband Sychaeus, and established a new city on the coast of Libya. In the [Aeneid](../sources/aeneid.md), she welcomes the shipwrecked [Aeneas](aeneas.md) and falls in love with him through [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md)'s machinations.

## In the [Aeneid](../sources/aeneid.md)

### Backstory: Flight from Tyre (1.340-368)

[Venus](../deities/aphrodite.md), disguised as a huntress, tells [Aeneas](aeneas.md) Dido's history. Her husband Sychaeus was "wealthiest in lands of the Phoenicians, and loved of her with ill-fated passion."[^aen-di-sychaeus] Her brother Pygmalion, "a monster of guilt unparalleled," murdered Sychaeus "before the altars with stealthy unsuspected weapon" out of lust for gold, then concealed the crime.[^aen-di-pygmalion]

Sychaeus's ghost appeared to Dido in sleep, "lifting up a face pale in wonderful wise, he exposed the merciless altars and his breast stabbed through with steel, and unwove all the blind web of household guilt." He counselled flight and revealed hidden treasure.[^aen-di-ghost] Dido gathered allies — "all in whom hatred of the tyrant was relentless or fear keen" — seized ships, and sailed to Libya, where she founded Carthage. Venus notes: "a woman leads the work."[^aen-di-woman]

### The Welcome (1.494-642)

Dido is introduced with a divine simile: "beautiful exceedingly, a youthful train thronging round her. Even as on Eurotas' banks or along the Cynthian ridges [Diana](../deities/artemis.md) wheels the dance, while behind her a thousand mountain nymphs crowd to left and right; she carries quiver on shoulder, and as she moves outshines them all in deity."[^aen-di-diana]

She received the Trojan envoys graciously, declaring "not ignorant of ill do I learn to succour the afflicted." When Aeneas revealed himself — his appearance enhanced by Venus to godlike radiance — she recognised his fame and offered him her city: "The city I establish is yours; draw your ships ashore; Trojan and Tyrian shall be held by me in even balance."[^aen-di-welcome]

### The Banquet and Cupid's Poison (1.695-756)

At the great feast, [Cupid](../deities/aphrodite.md) in the form of Ascanius inflamed Dido's heart. She was "victim to coming doom" who "cannot satiate her soul, but, stirred alike by the boy and the gifts, she gazes and takes fire."[^aen-di-fire] She "clings to him with her eyes and all her soul, and ever and anon fondles him in her lap." The god "touch by touch" effaced the memory of Sychaeus and "sows the surprise of a living love in the long-since-unstirred spirit and disaccustomed heart."[^aen-di-sychaeus-effaced]

Dido "wore the night in changing talk, alas! and drank long draughts of love" and begged Aeneas to tell his story from the beginning.[^aen-di-night]

[^aen-di-sychaeus]: "Her husband was Sychaeus, wealthiest in lands of the Phoenicians, and loved of her with ill-fated passion; to whom with virgin rites her father had given her maidenhood in wedlock" (Aeneid 1.343-345, trans. J.W. Mackail)
[^aen-di-pygmalion]: "the unnatural brother, blind with lust of gold, and reckless of his sister's love, lays Sychaeus low before the altars with stealthy unsuspected weapon" (Aeneid 1.349-351)
[^aen-di-ghost]: "in slumber came the very ghost of her unburied husband; lifting up a face pale in wonderful wise, he exposed the merciless altars and his breast stabbed through with steel, and unwove all the blind web of household guilt" (Aeneid 1.353-356)
[^aen-di-woman]: "they seize on ships that chanced to lie ready, and load them with the gold. Pygmalion's hoarded wealth is borne overseas; a woman leads the work" (Aeneid 1.363-364)
[^aen-di-diana]: "Dido the queen entered the precinct, beautiful exceedingly, a youthful train thronging round her. Even as on Eurotas' banks or along the Cynthian ridges Diana wheels the dance" (Aeneid 1.496-499)
[^aen-di-welcome]: "The city I establish is yours; draw your ships ashore; Trojan and Tyrian shall be held by me in even balance" (Aeneid 1.573-574)
[^aen-di-fire]: "the hapless Phoenician, victim to coming doom, cannot satiate her soul, but, stirred alike by the boy and the gifts, she gazes and takes fire" (Aeneid 1.712-713)
[^aen-di-sychaeus-effaced]: "he, mindful of his mother the Acidalian, begins touch by touch to efface Sychaeus, and sows the surprise of a living love in the long-since-unstirred spirit and disaccustomed heart" (Aeneid 1.720-722)
[^aen-di-night]: "Dido wore the night in changing talk, alas! and drank long draughts of love, asking many a thing of Priam, many a thing of Hector" (Aeneid 1.748-750)

### The Confession to Anna (4.1-55)

Dido confesses to her sister Anna the passion consuming her: "I know the prints of the ancient flame."[^aen-di-flame] She vows fidelity to Sychaeus's memory: "He took my love away who made me one with him long ago; he shall keep it with him, and guard it in the tomb."[^aen-di-vow] But Anna encourages the match, arguing both for love and for Carthage's security against hostile neighbours.

Dido is compared to a wounded deer: "Stung to misery, Dido wanders in frenzy all down the city, even as an arrow-stricken deer, whom, far and heedless amid the Cretan woodland, a shepherd archer hath pierced and left the flying steel in her unaware."[^aen-di-deer] The work of building Carthage halts: "No more do the unfinished towers rise, no more do the people exercise in arms... the works hang broken off, vast looming walls and engines towering into the sky."[^aen-di-works]

### The Cave (4.124-172)

[Juno](../deities/hera.md) and [Venus](../deities/aphrodite.md) conspire to unite the lovers. During a hunt, Juno pours down a storm, and "Dido and the Trojan captain take refuge in the same cavern. Primeval Earth and Juno the bridesmaid give the sign; fires flash out high in air, witnessing the union, and Nymphs cry aloud on the mountain-top."[^aen-di-cave] Virgil's judgment is devastating: "That day opened the gate of death and the springs of ill. For now Dido recks not of eye or tongue, nor sets her heart on love in secret: she calls it marriage, and with this name veils her fall."[^aen-di-fall]

### Aeneas's Departure (4.296-392)

When [Jupiter](../deities/zeus.md) sends [Mercury](../deities/hermes.md) to command [Aeneas](aeneas.md) to leave, Dido discovers his preparations. Her first speech is anguished: "And thou didst hope, traitor, to mask the crime, and slip away in silence from my land? Our love holds thee not, nor the hand thou once gavest, nor the bitter death that is left for Dido's portion?"[^aen-di-traitor] She appeals: "if I have done thee any grace, or aught of mine hath once been sweet in thy sight,—pity our sinking house."[^aen-di-pity]

Aeneas replies that he never claimed marriage, that fate and the gods command him to Italy, and that "Not of my will do I follow Italy." Dido's second speech is pure fury: "No goddess was thy mother, nor Dardanus founder of thy line, traitor! but rough Caucasus bore thee on his iron crags, and Hyrcanian tigresses gave thee suck."[^aen-di-tigers] She curses him: "In murky fires I will follow far away, and when chill death hath severed body from soul, my ghost will haunt thee in every region."[^aen-di-curse]

She sends Anna to plead once more, but Aeneas is immovable. He is compared to an oak in a storm: "even as when the eddying blasts of northern Alpine winds are emulous to uproot the secular strength of a mighty oak... the tree clings fast on the rocks, and high as her top soars into heaven, so deep strike her roots to hell; even thus is the hero buffeted with changeful perpetual accents."[^aen-di-oak]

### The Curse and Death (4.584-705)

When she sees the fleet departing at dawn, Dido utters her final curse — the prophecy of eternal enmity between Carthage and Rome: "Arise out of our dust, O unnamed avenger, to pursue the Dardanian settlement with firebrand and steel. Now, then, whensoever strength shall be given, I invoke the enmity of shore to shore, wave to water, sword to sword; let their battles go down to their children's children."[^aen-di-hannibal]

She mounts the funeral pyre, takes up Aeneas's sword, and speaks her last words: "I have lived and fulfilled Fortune's allotted course; and now shall I go a queenly phantom under the earth. I have built a renowned city; I have seen my ramparts rise; by my brother's punishment I have avenged my husband of his enemy; happy, ah me! and over happy, had but the keels of Dardania never touched our shores!"[^aen-di-last] She falls on the sword.

Her death is prolonged and agonising. [Juno](../deities/hera.md), "pitying her long pain and difficult decease, sent Iris down from heaven to unloose the struggling life from the body where it clung." Iris cuts a lock of hair sacred to Dis: "therewith all the warmth ebbed forth from her, and the life passed away upon the winds."[^aen-di-iris]

[^aen-di-flame]: "I know the prints of the ancient flame" (Aeneid 4.23)
[^aen-di-vow]: "He took my love away who made me one with him long ago; he shall keep it with him, and guard it in the tomb" (Aeneid 4.28-29)
[^aen-di-deer]: "Stung to misery, Dido wanders in frenzy all down the city, even as an arrow-stricken deer, whom, far and heedless amid the Cretan woodland, a shepherd archer hath pierced and left the flying steel in her unaware" (Aeneid 4.68-73)
[^aen-di-works]: "No more do the unfinished towers rise, no more do the people exercise in arms, nor work for safety in war on harbour or bastion; the works hang broken off, vast looming walls and engines towering into the sky" (Aeneid 4.86-89)
[^aen-di-cave]: "Dido and the Trojan captain take refuge in the same cavern. Primeval Earth and Juno the bridesmaid give the sign; fires flash out high in air, witnessing the union, and Nymphs cry aloud on the mountain-top" (Aeneid 4.165-168)
[^aen-di-fall]: "That day opened the gate of death and the springs of ill. For now Dido recks not of eye or tongue, nor sets her heart on love in secret: she calls it marriage, and with this name veils her fall" (Aeneid 4.169-172)
[^aen-di-traitor]: "And thou didst hope, traitor, to mask the crime, and slip away in silence from my land? Our love holds thee not, nor the hand thou once gavest, nor the bitter death that is left for Dido's portion?" (Aeneid 4.305-308)
[^aen-di-pity]: "if I have done thee any grace, or aught of mine hath once been sweet in thy sight,—pity our sinking house, and if there yet be room for prayers, put off this purpose of thine" (Aeneid 4.317-319)
[^aen-di-tigers]: "No goddess was thy mother, nor Dardanus founder of thy line, traitor! but rough Caucasus bore thee on his iron crags, and Hyrcanian tigresses gave thee suck" (Aeneid 4.365-367)
[^aen-di-curse]: "In murky fires I will follow far away, and when chill death hath severed body from soul, my ghost will haunt thee in every region. Wretch, thou shalt repay!" (Aeneid 4.384-387)
[^aen-di-oak]: "even as when the eddying blasts of northern Alpine winds are emulous to uproot the secular strength of a mighty oak... the tree clings fast on the rocks, and high as her top soars into heaven, so deep strike her roots to hell" (Aeneid 4.441-446)
[^aen-di-hannibal]: "Arise out of our dust, O unnamed avenger, to pursue the Dardanian settlement with firebrand and steel. Now, then, whensoever strength shall be given, I invoke the enmity of shore to shore, wave to water, sword to sword; let their battles go down to their children's children" (Aeneid 4.625-629)
[^aen-di-last]: "I have lived and fulfilled Fortune's allotted course; and now shall I go a queenly phantom under the earth. I have built a renowned city; I have seen my ramparts rise; by my brother's punishment I have avenged my husband of his enemy; happy, ah me! and over happy, had but the keels of Dardania never touched our shores!" (Aeneid 4.653-658)
[^aen-di-iris]: "Juno omnipotent, pitying her long pain and difficult decease, sent Iris down from heaven to unloose the struggling life from the body where it clung... 'This hair, sacred to Dis, I take as bidden, and release thee from that body of thine.' So speaks she, and cuts it with her hand. And therewith all the warmth ebbed forth from her, and the life passed away upon the winds" (Aeneid 4.693-705)

### The Underworld Meeting (6.450-476)

When [Aeneas](aeneas.md) descends to the underworld, he finds Dido in the Wailing Fields, where "they whom pitiless love hath wasted in cruel decay hide among untrodden ways, shrouded in embosoming myrtle thickets." He recognises her dim form "even as the moon at the month's beginning to him who sees or thinks he sees her rising through the vapours."[^aen-di-moon]

He speaks to her with tears: "Alas, Dido! so the news was true that reached me; thou didst perish, and the sword sealed thy doom! Ah me, was I cause of thy death?... the gods' commands drove me forth; nor could I deem my departure would bring thee pain so great as this."[^aen-di-underworld]

Her response is devastating silence: "She turned away with looks fixed fast on the ground, stirred no more in countenance by the speech he essays than if she stood in iron flint or Marpesian stone." She fled "wrathfully into the shadowy woodland, where Sychaeus, her ancient husband, responds to her distresses and equals her affection."[^aen-di-silence]

[^aen-di-moon]: "by her the Trojan hero stood, and knew the dim form through the darkness, even as the moon at the month's beginning to him who sees or thinks he sees her rising through the vapours" (Aeneid 6.452-454)
[^aen-di-underworld]: "Alas, Dido! so the news was true that reached me; thou didst perish, and the sword sealed thy doom! Ah me, was I cause of thy death?... the gods' commands drove me forth" (Aeneid 6.456-463)
[^aen-di-silence]: "She turned away with looks fixed fast on the ground, stirred no more in countenance by the speech he essays than if she stood in iron flint or Marpesian stone. At length she started, and fled wrathfully into the shadowy woodland, where Sychaeus, her ancient husband, responds to her distresses and equals her affection" (Aeneid 6.469-474)
