## Overview

**Dido** is the founder and queen of Carthage. A Phoenician princess, daughter of Belus, she fled Tyre after her brother Pygmalion murdered her husband Sychaeus, and established a new city on the coast of Libya. In the [Aeneid](../sources/aeneid.md), she welcomes the shipwrecked [Aeneas](aeneas.md) and falls in love with him through [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md)'s machinations.

### Backstory: Flight from Tyre (1.340-368)

[Venus](../deities/aphrodite.md), disguised as a huntress, tells [Aeneas](aeneas.md) Dido's history. Her husband Sychaeus was "wealthiest in lands of the Phoenicians, and loved of her with ill-fated passion."[^aen-di-sychaeus] Her brother Pygmalion, "a monster of guilt unparalleled," murdered Sychaeus "before the altars with stealthy unsuspected weapon" out of lust for gold, then concealed the crime.[^aen-di-pygmalion]

Sychaeus's ghost appeared to Dido in sleep, "lifting up a face pale in wonderful wise, he exposed the merciless altars and his breast stabbed through with steel, and unwove all the blind web of household guilt." He counselled flight and revealed hidden treasure.[^aen-di-ghost] Dido gathered allies — "all in whom hatred of the tyrant was relentless or fear keen" — seized ships, and sailed to Libya, where she founded Carthage. Venus notes: "a woman leads the work."[^aen-di-woman]

### The Welcome (1.494-642)

Dido is introduced with a divine simile: "beautiful exceedingly, a youthful train thronging round her. Even as on Eurotas' banks or along the Cynthian ridges [Diana](../deities/artemis.md) wheels the dance, while behind her a thousand mountain nymphs crowd to left and right; she carries quiver on shoulder, and as she moves outshines them all in deity."[^aen-di-diana]

She received the Trojan envoys graciously, declaring "not ignorant of ill do I learn to succour the afflicted." When Aeneas revealed himself — his appearance enhanced by Venus to godlike radiance — she recognised his fame and offered him her city: "The city I establish is yours; draw your ships ashore; Trojan and Tyrian shall be held by me in even balance."[^aen-di-welcome]

### The Banquet and Cupid's Poison (1.695-756)

At the great feast, [Cupid](../deities/aphrodite.md) in the form of Ascanius inflamed Dido's heart. She was "victim to coming doom" who "cannot satiate her soul, but, stirred alike by the boy and the gifts, she gazes and takes fire."[^aen-di-fire] She "clings to him with her eyes and all her soul, and ever and anon fondles him in her lap." The god "touch by touch" effaced the memory of Sychaeus and "sows the surprise of a living love in the long-since-unstirred spirit and disaccustomed heart."[^aen-di-sychaeus-effaced]

Dido "wore the night in changing talk, alas! and drank long draughts of love" and begged Aeneas to tell his story from the beginning.[^aen-di-night]

[^aen-di-sychaeus]: "Her husband was Sychaeus, wealthiest in lands of the Phoenicians, and loved of her with ill-fated passion; to whom with virgin rites her father had given her maidenhood in wedlock" (Aeneid 1.343-345, trans. J.W. Mackail)
[^aen-di-pygmalion]: "the unnatural brother, blind with lust of gold, and reckless of his sister's love, lays Sychaeus low before the altars with stealthy unsuspected weapon" (Aeneid 1.349-351)
[^aen-di-ghost]: "in slumber came the very ghost of her unburied husband; lifting up a face pale in wonderful wise, he exposed the merciless altars and his breast stabbed through with steel, and unwove all the blind web of household guilt" (Aeneid 1.353-356)
[^aen-di-woman]: "they seize on ships that chanced to lie ready, and load them with the gold. Pygmalion's hoarded wealth is borne overseas; a woman leads the work" (Aeneid 1.363-364)
[^aen-di-diana]: "Dido the queen entered the precinct, beautiful exceedingly, a youthful train thronging round her. Even as on Eurotas' banks or along the Cynthian ridges Diana wheels the dance" (Aeneid 1.496-499)
[^aen-di-welcome]: "The city I establish is yours; draw your ships ashore; Trojan and Tyrian shall be held by me in even balance" (Aeneid 1.573-574)
[^aen-di-fire]: "the hapless Phoenician, victim to coming doom, cannot satiate her soul, but, stirred alike by the boy and the gifts, she gazes and takes fire" (Aeneid 1.712-713)
[^aen-di-sychaeus-effaced]: "he, mindful of his mother the Acidalian, begins touch by touch to efface Sychaeus, and sows the surprise of a living love in the long-since-unstirred spirit and disaccustomed heart" (Aeneid 1.720-722)
[^aen-di-night]: "Dido wore the night in changing talk, alas! and drank long draughts of love, asking many a thing of Priam, many a thing of Hector" (Aeneid 1.748-750)
