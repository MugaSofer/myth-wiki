## Overview

**Penthesilea** was queen of the [Amazons](groups/amazons.md), daughter of [Ares](../deities/ares.md) and Otrere. She came to [Troy](../places/troy.md) after [Hector](hector.md)'s death as an ally of [Priam](priam.md), seeking purification for the accidental killing of her sister [Hippolyte](hippolyte.md). She routed the Greek army while [Achilles](achilles.md) and [Ajax](ajax.md) mourned at [Patroclus](patroclus.md)' tomb, but when the two heroes entered battle she was swiftly killed by Achilles, who was then struck with remorse at her beauty — a reaction caused by [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md).

## Appearance

The [Posthomerica](../sources/posthomerica.md) gives the most detailed physical description. When she arrives at Troy, "in her face glowed beauty glorious and terrible. Her smile was ravishing: beneath her brows her love-enkindling eyes shone like to stars, and with the crimson rose of shamefastness bright were her cheeks, and mantled over them unearthly grace with battle-prowess clad."[^post-beauty] She outshone her twelve companions "as when in the broad sky amidst the stars the moon rides over all pre-eminent."[^post-moon]

After Achilles killed her and removed her helmet, "there as fallen in dust and blood she lay, rose, like the breaking of the dawn, to view 'neath dainty-pencilled brows a lovely face, lovely in death." The Argives "all they saw and marvelled, for she seemed like an Immortal... she seemed the Child of Zeus, the tireless Huntress Artemis sleeping."[^post-death-beauty]

[Virgil](../sources/aeneid.md) depicts her on the temple of Juno at Carthage leading "crescent-shielded Amazonian columns in furious heat with thousands around her; clasping a golden belt under her naked breast, the warrior maiden clashes boldly with men."[^aen-penthesilea]

## In the Posthomerica

### Arrival at Troy

Penthesilea came from the Thermodon "athirst indeed for groan-resounding battle, but yet more fleeing abhorred reproach and evil fame, lest they of her own folk should rail on her because of her own sister's death, for whom ever her sorrows waxed, Hippolyte, whom she had struck dead with her mighty spear, not of her will—'twas at a stag she hurled."[^post-motive] She came also to cleanse her soul of murder's pollution and "to appease the Awful Ones, the Erinnyes, who in wrath for her slain sister straightway haunted her unseen."[^post-erinyes]

With her followed twelve Amazon princesses: Clonie, Polemusa, Derinoe, Evandre, Antandre, Bremusa, Hippothoe, Harmothoe, Alcibie, Derimacheia, Antibrote, and Thermodosa.[^post-companions]

[Priam](priam.md) welcomed her "as one who greets a daughter to her home returned from a far country in the twentieth year" and "pledged him to give many more, so she would save the Trojans from the imminent doom." She promised "such deeds... as no man had hoped for, even to lay Achilles low, to smite the wide host of the Argive men, and cast the brands red-flaming on the ships."[^post-promise] [Andromache](andromache.md), hearing this, murmured bitterly that Hector was mightier and yet was slain.[^post-andromache]

[^post-motive]: "came athirst indeed for groan-resounding battle, but yet more fleeing abhorred reproach and evil fame, lest they of her own folk should rail on her because of her own sister's death, for whom ever her sorrows waxed, Hippolyte, whom she had struck dead with her mighty spear, not of her will—'twas at a stag she hurled" (Posthomerica 1.263-270, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post-erinyes]: "of murder's dread pollution thus to cleanse her soul, and with such sacrifice to appease the Awful Ones, the Erinnyes, who in wrath for her slain sister straightway haunted her unseen" (Posthomerica 1.273-278, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post-companions]: Posthomerica 1.288-292
[^post-promise]: "such deeds she promised as no man had hoped for, even to lay Achilles low, to smite the wide host of the Argive men, and cast the brands red-flaming on the ships" (Posthomerica 1.352-355, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post-andromache]: "Hector was mightier far to wield the spear than thou, yet was for all his prowess slain" (Posthomerica 1.369-370, trans. A.S. Way)

### The Deceitful Dream

[Athena](../deities/athena.md) sent a deceitful dream "that so the warrior-maid might see it, and become a curse to Troy and to herself." The dream appeared "in likeness of her father" [Ares](../deities/ares.md), kindling her to meet [Achilles](achilles.md) in battle. "She heard the voice, and all her heart exulted, for she weened that she should on that dawning day achieve a mighty deed."[^post-dream]

[^post-dream]: "From heavens' blue depths slid down the might of a deceitful dream at Pallas' hest, that so the warrior-maid might see it, and become a curse to Troy and to herself... Stood o'er the maiden's head that baleful dream in likeness of her father, kindling her fearlessly front to front to meet in fight fleetfoot Achilles" (Posthomerica 1.397-407, trans. A.S. Way)

### Armour and Equipment

At dawn she donned armour given by [Ares](../deities/ares.md): golden greaves, a "rainbow-radiant corslet," a sword sheathed in ivory and silver, and a shield "whose rim swelled like the young moon's arching chariot-rail." Her helmet was "overstreamed with a wild mane of golden-glistering hairs." She carried two javelins and "a huge halberd, sharp of either blade, which terrible Eris gave to Ares' child to be her Titan weapon."[^post-arms] She rode a steed given by Oreithyia, "the wild North-wind's bride," whose "flying feet could match the Harpies' wings."[^post-horse]

[^post-arms]: "she array her shoulders in those wondrous-fashioned arms given her of the War-god... her rainbow-radiant corslet clasped she then... a huge halberd, sharp of either blade, which terrible Eris gave to Ares' child to be her Titan weapon in the strife that raveneth souls of men" (Posthomerica 1.421-449, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post-horse]: "a goodly steed and fleet, the gift of Oreithyia, the wild North-wind's bride... a steed whose flying feet could match the Harpies' wings" (Posthomerica 1.460-464, trans. A.S. Way)

### The Aristeia

Penthesilea's battle rampage dominated the field while Achilles and Ajax mourned at Patroclus' tomb. She killed Molion, Persinous, Eilissus, Antitheus, Hippalmus, Haemon's son, and Elasippus, and after Podarces wounded her companion Clonie, she struck through his right arm: "she shore atwain the great blood-brimming veins, and through the wide gash of the wound the gore spirted, a crimson fountain." Podarces died shortly after.[^post-aristeia]

Meanwhile, her Amazon companions also fought and fell: Bremusa was killed by [Idomeneus](idomeneus.md), Evandre and Thermodosa by Meriones, Derinoe by Ajax son of Oileus, and Alcibie and Derimacheia were beheaded by [Diomedes](diomedes.md).[^post-amazon-deaths]

Penthesilea drove the Greeks back to their ships. "Her aweless spirit failed for weariness nor fainted, but her might was adamantine." She boasted: "Ye dogs, this day for evil outrage done to Priam shall ye pay! No man of you shall from mine hands deliver his own life... Where skulketh now the strength of Tydeus' son, and where the might of Aeacus' scion? Where is Aias' bulk?"[^post-boast]

[^post-aristeia]: "she shore atwain the great blood-brimming veins, and through the wide gash of the wound the gore spirted, a crimson fountain. With a groan backward he sprang, his courage wholly quelled by bitter pain" (Posthomerica 1.566-572, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post-amazon-deaths]: Posthomerica 1.576-606
[^post-boast]: "Ye dogs, this day for evil outrage done to Priam shall ye pay! No man of you shall from mine hands deliver his own life... Where skulketh now the strength of Tydeus' son, and where the might of Aeacus' scion? Where is Aias' bulk?" (Posthomerica 1.686-695, trans. A.S. Way)

### Duel with Achilles and Death

When [Ajax](ajax.md) and [Achilles](achilles.md) finally entered battle, they swept through the Trojan ranks "like ravening beasts." Achilles killed several Amazons — Antandre, Polemusa, Antibrote, Hippothoe, and Harmothoe. Penthesilea rushed to meet them and hurled her lance at Achilles' shield, "but glancing thence this way and that the shivered fragments sprang as from a rock-face: of such temper were the cunning-hearted Fire-god's gifts divine." Her second spear struck Ajax's silver greave but could not pierce it.[^post-spears]

She declared her divine parentage: "With my blood is mingled war! No mortal man begat me, but the Lord of War, insatiate of the battle-cry. Therefore my might is more than any man's."[^post-boast2] Achilles replied with contempt: "Even Hector quailed, the battle-swift, before us... But thou—thine heart is utterly mad."[^post-achilles-reply]

Achilles thrust his spear "above the right breast" and "the red blood leapt forth, as a fountain wells, and all at once fainted the strength of Penthesileia's limbs; dropped the great battle-axe from her nerveless hand; a mist of darkness overveiled her eyes." In her dying moments she considered whether to draw her sword or dismount and beg for mercy: "O, I long to live!" But Achilles "thrust with sudden spear, and on its shaft impaled the body of her tempest-footed steed" and Penthesilea together. "Face down she lay on the long spear outgasping her last breath, stretched upon that fleet horse as on a couch."[^post-death]

[^post-spears]: "Leapt the long-shafted lance sped from the hand of goodly Penthesileia. Straight it flew to the shield of Aeacus' son, but glancing thence this way and that the shivered fragments sprang as from a rock-face: of such temper were the cunning-hearted Fire-god's gifts divine" (Posthomerica 1.1006-1011, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post-boast2]: "With my blood is mingled war! No mortal man begat me, but the Lord of War, insatiate of the battle-cry. Therefore my might is more than any man's" (Posthomerica 1.1024-1027, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post-achilles-reply]: "Ay, even Hector quailed, the battle-swift, before us, e'en though far away he saw our onrush to grim battle. Yea, my spear slew him, for all his might. But thou—thine heart is utterly mad" (Posthomerica 1.1053-1058, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post-death]: "above the right breast pierced the battle-eager maid. The red blood leapt forth, as a fountain wells... Confusedly she thought: 'Or shall I draw my mighty sword... or hastily cast me from my fleet horse down to earth, and kneel unto this godlike man... O, I long to live!'... he thrust with sudden spear, and on its shaft impaled the body of her tempest-footed steed... so from the once fleet steed low fallen lay Penthesileia" (Posthomerica 1.1073-1122, trans. A.S. Way)

### Achilles' Remorse and Aphrodite's Design

Removing her helmet, Achilles saw her face and "all his heart was wrung, was broken down with sorrowing love, deep, strong as he had known when that beloved friend Patroclus died."[^post-remorse] This was [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md)'s doing: "She was made a wonder of beauty even in her death by Aphrodite glorious-crowned, the Bride of the strong War-god, to the end that he, the son of noble Peleus, might be pierced with the sharp arrow of repentant love."[^post-aphrodite]

[^post-remorse]: "all his heart was wrung, was broken down with sorrowing love, deep, strong as he had known when that beloved friend Patroclus died" (Posthomerica 1.1252-1254, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post-aphrodite]: "She was made a wonder of beauty even in her death by Aphrodite glorious-crowned, the Bride of the strong War-god, to the end that he, the son of noble Peleus, might be pierced with the sharp arrow of repentant love" (Posthomerica 1.1177-1181, trans. A.S. Way)

### Thersites' Death

Thersites mocked Achilles: "Thou sorry-souled Achilles! art not shamed to let some evil Power beguile thine heart to pity of a pitiful Amazon... Ha, woman-mad art thou." Achilles struck him with "a sudden buffet of his resistless hand" beneath the ear: "all his teeth were dashed to the earth: he fell upon his face: forth of his lips the blood in torrent gushed: swift from his body fled the dastard soul."[^post-thersites]

[Diomedes](diomedes.md) alone was angered, "seeing these twain were of the self-same blood" — Thersites was descended from Agrius, brother of Oeneus, Diomedes' grandfather. Diomedes "had raised against the son of Peleus vengeful hands, except the noblest of Achaea's sons had thronged around him, and besought him sore."[^post-diomedes]

[^post-thersites]: "Thou sorry-souled Achilles! art not shamed to let some evil Power beguile thine heart to pity of a pitiful Amazon... a sudden buffet of his resistless hand smote 'neath the railer's ear, and all his teeth were dashed to the earth: he fell upon his face: forth of his lips the blood in torrent gushed: swift from his body fled the dastard soul" (Posthomerica 1.1257-1288, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post-diomedes]: "Tydeus' son alone of all the Argives was with anger stirred against Achilles for Thersites slain, seeing these twain were of the self-same blood... had raised against the son of Peleus vengeful hands, except the noblest of Achaea's sons had thronged around him" (Posthomerica 1.1317-1331, trans. A.S. Way)

### Burial

The Atreids, pitying her beauty, returned her body to the Trojans. Priam "heaped a high broad pyre without the city wall" and burned her with "costly treasures." Her bones were gathered, anointed, and "laid them in a casket." She was buried "on an outstanding tower, beside the bones of old Laomedon, a queen beside a king."[^post-burial] The twelve Amazon companions were buried nearby.

[^post-burial]: "by the stately wall they buried her on an outstanding tower, beside the bones of old Laomedon, a queen beside a king. This honour for the War-god's sake they rendered, and for Penthesileia's own" (Posthomerica 1.1364-1368, trans. A.S. Way)

### Ares' Attempted Intervention

When Ares heard of his daughter's death, "from Olympus down he darted, swift and bright as thunderbolt." He leapt to Ida's ridges and the earth quaked beneath him. "Now had Ares brought a day of mourning on the Myrmidons, but Zeus himself from far Olympus sent mid shattering thunders terror of levin-bolts" before his feet. Ares relented, remembering "how that many and many a son of Zeus himself in many a war had died, nor in their fall had Zeus availed them aught" — else "with Titans in the nether gloom he had lain."[^post-ares]

[^post-ares]: "Straight from Olympus down he darted, swift and bright as thunderbolt... Now had Ares brought a day of mourning on the Myrmidons, but Zeus himself from far Olympus sent mid shattering thunders terror of levin-bolts... he remembered how that many and many a son of Zeus himself in many a war had died, nor in their fall had Zeus availed them aught" (Posthomerica 1.1193-1244, trans. A.S. Way)

## In Other Sources

[Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) reports that Penthesilea was "daughter of Otrere and Ares" who "accidentally killed Hippolyte and was purified by Priam. In battle she slew many, and amongst them Machaon, and was afterwards herself killed by Achilles, who fell in love with the Amazon after her death and slew Thersites for jeering at him."[^apd-penthesilea]

The [Epic Cycle](../sources/epic-cycle.md) (Aethiopis) confirms: "The Amazon Penthesilea, the daughter of Ares and of Thracian race, comes to aid the Trojans."[^ec-penthesilea]

[Hyginus](../sources/hyginus.md) lists Penthesilea among the fifteen named Amazons.[^hyg-list]

[^apd-penthesilea]: "Penthesilia, daughter of Otrere and Ares, accidentally killed Hippolyte and was purified by Priam. In battle she slew many, and amongst them Machaon, and was afterwards herself killed by Achilles, who fell in love with the Amazon after her death and slew Thersites for jeering at him" (Bibliotheca E.5.1, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^ec-penthesilea]: Epic Cycle, Aethiopis (summary by Proclus, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^hyg-list]: Fabulae §163

## Variant Traditions

The Posthomerica and [Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) agree on the main elements — Penthesilea killed Hippolyte accidentally, was purified by Priam, fought bravely at Troy, and was killed by Achilles who then loved her in death. However, Apollodorus adds that she killed Machaon in battle, a detail absent from Quintus' account (where no named Greek of that stature falls to her). The Posthomerica gives the cause of her sister's death more specifically — she hurled a spear at a stag and struck Hippolyte instead — while Apollodorus simply says it was accidental.

The Posthomerica attributes Achilles' remorse to [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md)'s deliberate intervention, "to the end that he... might be pierced with the sharp arrow of repentant love." Apollodorus records the same emotional response but does not mention a divine cause.
