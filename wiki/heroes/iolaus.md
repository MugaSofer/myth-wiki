## Overview

**Iolaus** was the son of Iphiclus and nephew of [Heracles](heracles.md). He served as Heracles' companion during his labours and, in his old age, became the protector of Heracles' children against [Eurystheus](eurystheus.md).

## In the Bibliotheca

In Apollodorus's account, Iolaus served as Heracles' charioteer and companion. He assisted in the second labour by cauterizing the stumps of the [Hydra](../creatures/hydra.md)'s heads as Heracles cut them: "Hercules called for the help of Iolaus who, by setting fire to a piece of the neighbouring wood and burning the roots of the heads with the brands, prevented them from sprouting."[^apd-hydra]

[^apd-hydra]: "Hercules called for the help of Iolaus who, by setting fire to a piece of the neighbouring wood and burning the roots of the heads with the brands, prevented them from sprouting" (Bibliotheca 2.5.2, trans. Frazer)

## In Euripides' Heraclidae

### Protector of the Heraclidae

Iolaus is the central figure of the play's first half. Now aged and frail, he has accompanied [Heracles](heracles.md)' children as they flee [Eurystheus](eurystheus.md)'s persecution across Greece. He explains his motivation as duty and shame: "I, through shame, and reverencing the ties of kindred, when it was in my power to dwell quietly in Argos, partook of more of Hercules' labors, while he was with us, than any one man besides."[^eur-hcl-shame]

At Marathon, near Athens, he sits as a suppliant at the altar of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) with the children, while [Alcmena](alcmena.md) shelters the girls inside the temple. When Copreus, Eurystheus's herald, attempts to drag them away by force, Iolaus appeals to Demophoon, son of [Theseus](theseus.md), citing kinship (Heracles rescued Theseus from the underworld) and the sanctity of suppliancy.[^eur-hcl-appeal]

When the oracle demands a noble virgin's sacrifice, Iolaus despairs: "O children, we are like sailors, who, fleeing from the fierce rage of the storm, have come close to land, and then, again, by gales from the land, have been driven again out to sea."[^eur-hcl-sailors] He even offers himself as a substitute to Eurystheus, but Demophoon explains Eurystheus wants the children dead, not Iolaus.[^eur-hcl-substitute]

### Rejuvenation in Battle

Despite his age, Iolaus insists on joining the battle, taking captured arms from a temple. He longs for his lost strength: "O arm, would thou wert such an ally to me as I recollect you in your youth, when you ravaged Sparta with Hercules, how would I put Eurystheus to flight."[^eur-hcl-arm]

Pursuing Eurystheus's chariot after the Athenian victory, he prays to [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) and [Hera](../deities/hera.md) to be young for one day. Two stars appear on his chariot, concealing it in cloud — identified by "the wiser men" as [Heracles](heracles.md) and [Hebe](../deities/hebe.md). Iolaus emerges miraculously rejuvenated: "he from the obscure darkness showed forth a youthful image of youthful arms." He captures Eurystheus at the Scironian rocks and brings him back in fetters.[^eur-hcl-rejuv]

[^eur-hcl-shame]: "I, through shame, and reverencing the ties of kindred, when it was in my power to dwell quietly in Argos, partook of more of Hercules' labors, while he was with us, than any one man besides" (Heraclidae 26–30, trans. T.A. Buckley)
[^eur-hcl-appeal]: "I formerly, when shield-bearer to their father, sailed with Theseus after the belt, the cause of much slaughter, and from the murky recesses of hell did he bring forth your father" (Heraclidae 215–219, trans. T.A. Buckley)
[^eur-hcl-sailors]: "O children, we are like sailors, who, fleeing from the fierce rage of the storm, have come close to land, and then, again, by gales from the land, have been driven again out to sea" (Heraclidae 427–432, trans. T.A. Buckley)
[^eur-hcl-substitute]: "the king does not lead his army hither wanting you; for what profit were it to Eurystheus for an old man to die? but he wishes to slay these children" (Heraclidae 466–470, trans. T.A. Buckley)
[^eur-hcl-arm]: "O arm, would thou wert such an ally to me as I recollect you in your youth, when you ravaged Sparta with Hercules, how would I put Eurystheus to flight" (Heraclidae 740–744, trans. T.A. Buckley)
[^eur-hcl-rejuv]: "two stars standing on the horse-chariot, concealed the chariot in a dim cloud, the wiser men say it was thy son and Hebe; but he from the obscure darkness showed forth a youthful image of youthful arms. And the glorious Iolaus takes the four-horse chariot of Eurystheus at the Scironian rocks" (Heraclidae 849–858, trans. T.A. Buckley)
