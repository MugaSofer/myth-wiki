## Overview

**Bellerophon** is a hero best known for slaying the [Chimaera](../creatures/chimaera.md). His fullest story appears in [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book VI, told by his grandson Glaukos to Diomedes on the battlefield. Born of the line of Sisyphos, Bellerophon was granted "beauty and lovely manhood" by the gods, but his story ends in one of the most haunting images in Homer: a man wandering alone, hated by the gods, "devouring his own soul."

## Parentage

Two traditions survive in our sources regarding Bellerophon's parentage.

In the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md), the lineage is straightforward: "Sisyphos son of Aiolos; and he begat a son, even Glaukos, and Glaukos begat noble Bellerophon."[^il6-lineage]

A Hesiodic fragment from the Catalogue of Women gives a more complex account: Glaukos's wife "lay in the arms of [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) and bare in the house of Glaucus blameless Bellerophon, surpassing all men." In this version, [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) had sworn that the son of Sisyphos's line "should never have children born of one father," and so Bellerophon's true father was Poseidon rather than Glaukos.[^hes-parentage] This fragment also says that "when he began to roam, his father gave him [Pegasus](../creatures/pegasus.md) who would bear him most swiftly on his wings."[^hes-pegasus]

## In the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md)

### The Story of Glaukos (Book VI)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book VI, when Glaukos and Diomedes meet on the battlefield, Glaukos tells the story of his grandfather Bellerophon at length. It is one of the most complete mythological narratives embedded in the Iliad.

#### Proitos and Anteia

Bellerophon dwelt in Argos, but "Proitos in his heart devised ill for him, and being mightier far drave him from the land of the Argives." The cause was Proitos's wife: "Proitos' wife, goodly Anteia, lusted after him, to have converse in secret love, but no whit prevailed she, for the uprightness of his heart, on wise Bellerophon."[^il6-anteia] Rejected, Anteia made a false accusation: "Die, Proitos, or else slay Bellerophon, that would have converse in love with me against my will."[^il6-accusation]

#### The Deadly Tokens

Proitos would not kill Bellerophon directly, "for his soul had shame of that," but instead "sent him to Lykia, and gave him tokens of woe, graving in a folded tablet many deadly things, and bade him shew these to Anteia's father, that he might be slain."[^il6-tokens] This is a rare reference to writing in Homer.

The Lykian king entertained Bellerophon for nine days before asking to see the tokens. "Now when he had received of him Proitos' evil token," he set Bellerophon three deadly tasks.[^il6-king]

#### The Three Tasks

First, "he bade him slay [Chimaira](../creatures/chimaera.md) the unconquerable. Of divine birth was she and not of men, in front a lion, and behind a serpent, and in the midst a goat; and she breathed dread fierceness of blazing fire. And her he slew, obedient to the signs of heaven."[^il6-chimaira]

"Next fought he with the famed Solymi; this, said he, was the mightiest battle of warriors wherein he entered."[^il6-solymi]

"And thirdly he slew the Amazons, women peers of men."[^il6-amazons]

#### The Ambush

When even these tasks failed to kill Bellerophon, "the king devised another cunning wile; he picked from wide Lykia the bravest men, and set an ambush. But these returned nowise home again; for noble Bellerophon slew them all."[^il6-ambush]

#### Recognition and Reward

"So when the king now knew that he was the brave offspring of a god, he kept him there, and plighted him his daughter, and gave him the half of all the honour of his kingdom; moreover the Lykians meted him a domain preeminent above all, fair with vineyards and tilth to possess it."[^il6-reward]

#### Children

"And his wife bare wise Bellerophon three children, Isandros and Hippolochos and Laodameia. With Laodameia lay [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) the lord of counsel, and she bare godlike Sarpedon, the warrior with arms of bronze."[^il6-children]

#### Downfall

The poem gives no explanation for what follows, only the devastating image: "But when even Bellerophon came to be hated of all the gods, then wandered he alone in the Aleian plain, devouring his own soul, and avoiding the paths of men."[^il6-downfall]

His children fared no better: "Isandros his son was slain by [Ares](../deities/ares.md) insatiate of battle, as he fought against the famed Solymi, and his daughter was slain in wrath of gold-gleaming [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md)."[^il6-children-fate] Only Hippolochos survived to father Glaukos, the speaker.

### Guest-Friendship with Oineus (Book VI)

When Diomedes hears this lineage, he recognises an ancestral bond: "goodly Oineus of yore entertained noble Bellerophon in his halls and kept him twenty days. Moreover they gave each the other goodly gifts of friendship; Oineus gave a belt bright with purple, and Bellerophon a gold twy-handled cup."[^il6-oineus] The two warriors exchange arms rather than fight, honouring this ancient guest-friendship.

## In the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md)

In the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md), Bellerophon appears briefly in connection with the [Chimaera](../creatures/chimaera.md): "Her did [Pegasus](../creatures/pegasus.md) and noble Bellerophon slay."[^theog-slay] The Theogony credits both Pegasus and Bellerophon jointly, whereas the Iliad credits Bellerophon alone.

## In the Hesiodic Catalogue of Women

A fragmentary passage gives additional detail: Bellerophon "caught and slew the fire-breathing Chimera" with the aid of [Pegasus](../creatures/pegasus.md), and "wedded the dear child of the great-hearted Iobates, the worshipful king."[^hes-chimera] This names the Lykian king as Iobates, a detail not given in the Iliad.

## In the [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md)

Apollodorus gives a concise account of Bellerophon's story in Book 2, largely consistent with the Iliad but with several additional details.

### Parentage and Exile

Apollodorus identifies Bellerophon as "son of Glaucus, son of Sisyphus," matching the Iliad's lineage.[^apd-bel-parentage] He adds a detail absent from Homer: Bellerophon came to Proetus because he had "accidentally killed his brother Deliades or, as some say, Piren, or, as others will have it, Alcimenes."[^apd-bel-brother] Three variant names for the slain brother are given, suggesting competing traditions. Proetus purified him of the killing.

### Stheneboea's Accusation

As in the Iliad, the queen fell in love with Bellerophon: "Stheneboea fell in love with him, and sent him proposals for a meeting; and when he rejected them, she told Proetus that Bellerophon had sent her a vicious proposal."[^apd-bel-stheneboea] Apollodorus uses the name Stheneboea (from the tragic poets) rather than Homer's Anteia. Proetus then gave Bellerophon a letter to take to Iobates, "in which it was written that he was to kill Bellerophon."[^apd-bel-letter]

### The Chimaera

Iobates ordered Bellerophon to kill the [Chimaera](../creatures/chimaera.md), "believing that he would be destroyed by the beast, for it was more than a match for many, let alone one."[^apd-bel-chimaera-task] Apollodorus gives the most detailed physical description: "it had the fore part of a lion, the tail of a dragon, and its third head, the middle one, was that of a goat, through which it belched fire. And it devastated the country and harried the cattle; for it was a single creature with the power of three beasts."[^apd-bel-chimaera-desc] He notes the creature "was bred by Amisodarus" and "was begotten by Typhon on [Echidna](../creatures/echidna.md), as Hesiod relates."[^apd-bel-chimaera-origin]

Bellerophon "mounted his winged steed [Pegasus](../creatures/pegasus.md), offspring of Medusa and [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md), and soaring on high shot down the Chimera from the height."[^apd-bel-chimaera-kill] This specifies the method of attack -- shooting from above -- which Homer does not.

### Further Quests

Iobates then ordered Bellerophon to fight the Solymi, and after that to combat the Amazons. "And when he had killed them also, he picked out the reputed bravest of the Lycians and bade them lay an ambush and slay him. But when Bellerophon had killed them also to a man."[^apd-bel-quests]

### Recognition

"Iobates, in admiration of his prowess, showed him the letter and begged him to stay with him; moreover he gave him his daughter Philonoe, and dying bequeathed to him the kingdom."[^apd-bel-reward] Apollodorus names the daughter Philonoe, a detail not found in the Iliad.

Unlike the Iliad, Apollodorus's account ends here -- there is no mention of Bellerophon's downfall, his wandering in the Aleian plain, or the deaths of his children. The tragic ending is unique to Homer.

## In the Fabulae

The [Fabulae](../sources/hyginus.md) gives a compact account with one significant variant detail about Bellerophon's end.

### Stheneboea's Accusation (§57)

"When Bellerophon had come as an exile to the court of King Proetus, Stheneboea, the King's wife, fell in love with him. On his refusal to lie with her, she falsely told her husband she had been forced by him."[^hyg-57-accusation] The Fabulae uses the name Stheneboea (like Apollodorus and the tragedians) rather than the Iliad's Anteia.

"Proetus, hearing this, wrote a letter about it, and sent him to Iobates, Stheneboea's father."[^hyg-57-letter] This makes Iobates Stheneboea's father rather than Proetus's father-in-law, differing from the usual tradition.

### The Chimaera

"After reading the letter, Iobates was reluctant to kill such a hero, but sent him to kill the Chimaera, a three-formed creature said to breathe forth fire. [Likewise: forepart lion, rearpart snake, middle she-goat.] This he slew, riding on Pegasus."[^hyg-57-chimaera]

### The Fall in the Aleian Plain

The Fabulae provides a detail about Bellerophon's downfall absent from other sources: "he is said to have fallen in the Aleian plains and have dislocated his hip."[^hyg-57-fall] This gives a physical explanation for his wandering — an injury sustained from a fall (presumably from Pegasus).

### Stheneboea's Suicide

Unlike the Iliad (which doesn't mention Stheneboea's fate) or Apollodorus, the Fabulae adds: "But the king, praising his valor, gave him his other daughter in marriage, and Stheneboea, hearing of it, killed herself."[^hyg-57-suicide]

> **NEW DETAIL:** Stheneboea's suicide upon hearing of Bellerophon's marriage is unique to the Fabulae. The dislocated hip from a fall in the Aleian plain is also distinctive, providing a physical cause for the wandering that the Iliad presents as purely divine rejection.

[^hyg-57-accusation]: "When Bellerophon had come as an exile to the court of King Proetus, Stheneboea, the King's wife, fell in love with him. On his refusal to lie with her, she falsely told her husband she had been forced by him" (Fabulae §57, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-57-letter]: "Proetus, hearing this, wrote a letter about it, and sent him to Iobates, Stheneboea's father" (Fabulae §57, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-57-chimaera]: "After reading the letter, Iobates was reluctant to kill such a hero, but sent him to kill the Chimaera, a three-formed creature said to breathe forth fire. [Likewise: forepart lion, rearpart snake, middle she-goat.] This he slew, riding on Pegasus" (Fabulae §57, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-57-fall]: "he is said to have fallen in the Aleian plains and have dislocated his hip" (Fabulae §57, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-57-suicide]: "the king, praising his valor, gave him his other daughter in marriage, and Stheneboea, hearing of it, killed herself" (Fabulae §57, trans. Mary Grant)
