## Overview

**Teiresias** (also Tiresias) was the most famous seer of Greek mythology, a Theban prophet who was blind but possessed the gift of prophecy. Multiple explanations were given for both his blindness and his prophetic abilities. He appears as a key advisor in the Theban cycle and is consulted by [Odysseus](odysseus.md) in the land of the dead.

### Blindness and Prophecy (3.6.7)

Apollodorus reports multiple traditions about Teiresias's blindness:

1. **Revealing divine secrets**: "some say that he was blinded by the gods because he revealed their secrets to men."[^apd-secrets]

2. **Seeing [Athena](../deities/athena.md) naked**: "Pherecydes says that he was blinded by Athena; for Chariclo was dear to Athena... and Tiresias saw the goddess stark naked, and she covered his eyes with her hands, and so rendered him sightless." When Chariclo begged Athena to restore his sight, "she could not do so, but by cleansing his ears she caused him to understand every note of birds; and she gave him a staff of cornel-wood, wherewith he walked like those who see."[^apd-athena]

3. **The snakes and the sex-change**: "Hesiod says that he beheld snakes copulating on Cyllene, and that having wounded them he was turned from a man into a woman, but that on observing the same snakes copulating again, he became a man." When [Hera](../deities/hera.md) and [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) disputed "whether the pleasures of love are felt more by women or by men, they referred to him for a decision. He said that if the pleasures of love be reckoned at ten, men enjoy one and women nine. Wherefore Hera blinded him, but Zeus bestowed on him the art of soothsaying."[^apd-snakes]

"He also lived to a great age."[^apd-age]

[^apd-secrets]: "some say that he was blinded by the gods because he revealed their secrets to men" (Bibliotheca 3.6.7, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-athena]: "Pherecydes says that he was blinded by Athena; for Chariclo was dear to Athena... and Tiresias saw the goddess stark naked, and she covered his eyes with her hands, and so rendered him sightless. And when Chariclo asked her to restore his sight, she could not do so, but by cleansing his ears she caused him to understand every note of birds; and she gave him a staff of cornel-wood, wherewith he walked like those who see" (Bibliotheca 3.6.7, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-snakes]: "Hesiod says that he beheld snakes copulating on Cyllene, and that having wounded them he was turned from a man into a woman, but that on observing the same snakes copulating again, he became a man. Hence, when Hera and Zeus disputed whether the pleasures of love are felt more by women or by men, they referred to him for a decision. He said that if the pleasures of love be reckoned at ten, men enjoy one and women nine. Wherefore Hera blinded him, but Zeus bestowed on him the art of soothsaying" (Bibliotheca 3.6.7, trans. J.G. Frazer)

### The Seven Against Thebes (3.6.7)

Teiresias advised the Thebans during the siege of the Seven: "he said that they should be victorious if Menoeceus, son of Creon, would offer himself freely as a sacrifice to [Ares](../deities/ares.md)."[^apd-seven]

[^apd-seven]: "he said that they should be victorious if Menoeceus, son of Creon, would offer himself freely as a sacrifice to Ares" (Bibliotheca 3.6.7, trans. J.G. Frazer)

### Death (3.7.3)

During the fall of [Thebes](../places/thebes.md) to the Epigoni, "Tiresias told them to send a herald to treat with the Argives." The Thebans fled and Teiresias "drank of it and expired" at the spring Tilphossa.[^apd-death]

His daughter Manto was dedicated to [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) at Delphi by the victors.[^apd-manto]

## In the Odyssey

[Circe](../deities/circe.md) instructs [Odysseus](odysseus.md) to journey to the land of the dead to consult "the spirit of Theban Teiresias, the blind seer, whose wits abide steadfast. To him even in death Persephone has granted reason, that he alone should have understanding."[^od10-circe]

Odysseus performs the necessary rites and Teiresias's shade appears, prophesying Odysseus's difficult homecoming and the vengeance against the suitors.[^od11-prophecy]

## In Sophocles' Oedipus the King

Teiresias is summoned by [Oedipus](../heroes/oedipus.md) to identify the murderer of Laius. He reluctantly reveals the truth — that Oedipus himself is the murderer — leading to a furious confrontation.[^soph-oed]

[^soph-oed]: Sophocles, Oedipus the King ~300-462

## In the Metamorphoses

Ovid retells the sex-change story: Teiresias struck two copulating serpents and was transformed into a woman for seven years, then struck them again and became a man. Called to arbitrate between Jupiter and Juno, "he took the side of Jove," and Juno in anger "condemned the arbitrator to perpetual blindness." Jupiter compensated him "by granting him the knowledge of the future."[^met3-teiresias]
