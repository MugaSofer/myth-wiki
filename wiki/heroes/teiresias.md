## Overview

**Teiresias** (also Tiresias) was the most famous seer of Greek mythology, a Theban prophet who was blind but possessed the gift of prophecy. Multiple explanations were given for both his blindness and his prophetic abilities. He appears as a key advisor in the Theban cycle and is consulted by [Odysseus](odysseus.md) in the land of the dead.

## In the Bibliotheca

### Blindness and Prophecy (3.6.7)

Apollodorus reports multiple traditions about Teiresias's blindness:

1. **Revealing divine secrets**: "some say that he was blinded by the gods because he revealed their secrets to men."[^apd-secrets]

2. **Seeing [Athena](../deities/athena.md) naked**: "Pherecydes says that he was blinded by Athena; for Chariclo was dear to Athena... and Tiresias saw the goddess stark naked, and she covered his eyes with her hands, and so rendered him sightless." When Chariclo begged Athena to restore his sight, "she could not do so, but by cleansing his ears she caused him to understand every note of birds; and she gave him a staff of cornel-wood, wherewith he walked like those who see."[^apd-athena]

3. **The snakes and the sex-change**: "Hesiod says that he beheld snakes copulating on Cyllene, and that having wounded them he was turned from a man into a woman, but that on observing the same snakes copulating again, he became a man." When [Hera](../deities/hera.md) and [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) disputed "whether the pleasures of love are felt more by women or by men, they referred to him for a decision. He said that if the pleasures of love be reckoned at ten, men enjoy one and women nine. Wherefore Hera blinded him, but Zeus bestowed on him the art of soothsaying."[^apd-snakes]

"He also lived to a great age."[^apd-age]

[^apd-secrets]: "some say that he was blinded by the gods because he revealed their secrets to men" (Bibliotheca 3.6.7, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-athena]: "Pherecydes says that he was blinded by Athena; for Chariclo was dear to Athena... and Tiresias saw the goddess stark naked, and she covered his eyes with her hands, and so rendered him sightless. And when Chariclo asked her to restore his sight, she could not do so, but by cleansing his ears she caused him to understand every note of birds; and she gave him a staff of cornel-wood, wherewith he walked like those who see" (Bibliotheca 3.6.7, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-snakes]: "Hesiod says that he beheld snakes copulating on Cyllene, and that having wounded them he was turned from a man into a woman, but that on observing the same snakes copulating again, he became a man. Hence, when Hera and Zeus disputed whether the pleasures of love are felt more by women or by men, they referred to him for a decision. He said that if the pleasures of love be reckoned at ten, men enjoy one and women nine. Wherefore Hera blinded him, but Zeus bestowed on him the art of soothsaying" (Bibliotheca 3.6.7, trans. J.G. Frazer)

### The Seven Against Thebes (3.6.7)

Teiresias advised the Thebans during the siege of the Seven: "he said that they should be victorious if Menoeceus, son of Creon, would offer himself freely as a sacrifice to [Ares](../deities/ares.md)."[^apd-seven]

[^apd-seven]: "he said that they should be victorious if Menoeceus, son of Creon, would offer himself freely as a sacrifice to Ares" (Bibliotheca 3.6.7, trans. J.G. Frazer)

### Death (3.7.3)

During the fall of [Thebes](../places/thebes.md) to the Epigoni, "Tiresias told them to send a herald to treat with the Argives." The Thebans fled and Teiresias "drank of it and expired" at the spring Tilphossa.[^apd-death]

His daughter Manto was dedicated to [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) at Delphi by the victors.[^apd-manto]

## In the Odyssey

[Circe](../deities/circe.md) instructs [Odysseus](odysseus.md) to journey to the land of the dead to consult "the spirit of Theban Teiresias, the blind seer, whose wits abide steadfast. To him even in death Persephone has granted reason, that he alone should have understanding."[^od10-circe]

Odysseus performs the necessary rites and Teiresias's shade appears, prophesying Odysseus's difficult homecoming and the vengeance against the suitors.[^od11-prophecy]

## In Sophocles' Oedipus the King

Teiresias is summoned by [Oedipus](../heroes/oedipus.md) to identify the murderer of Laius. He reluctantly reveals the truth — that Oedipus himself is the murderer — leading to a furious confrontation.[^soph-oed]

## In Callimachus's Hymns

### Blinding by Athena (Hymn V, On the Bath of Pallas)

Callimachus tells the fullest version of the Athena-blinding tradition. [Athena](../deities/athena.md)'s beloved companion was the nymph Chariclo, Teiresias's mother — "one nymph of old in Thebes did Athena love much, yea beyond all her companions, even the mother of Teiresias, and was never apart from her."[^call-chariclo]

One day Athena and Chariclo were bathing together at the Fountain of the Horse on [Helicon](../places/helicon.md). Young Teiresias, "on whose cheek the down was just darkening," was hunting with his hounds and stumbled upon them. "Athirst beyond telling, he came unto the flowing fountain, wretched man! And unwillingly saw that which is not lawful to be seen."[^call-saw]

Athena's reaction was immediate: "What god, O son of Everes, led thee on this grievous way? Hence shalt thou never more take back thine eyes!" Night seized the youth's eyes at once. "He stood there speechless; for pain glued his knees and helplessness stayed his voice."[^call-blind]

Chariclo's lament was bitter: "What hast thou done to my boy, lady? Is such the friendship of you goddesses? Thou hast taken away the eyes of my son... O me unhappy! O hill, O Helicon, where I may no more come, surely a great price for little has been exacted. Losing a few gazelles and deer, thou hast taken the eyes of my child."[^call-chariclo-lament]

Athena pitied her companion but explained the immovable law: "It is not I that made thy child blind. For no sweet thing is it for Athena to snatch away the eyes of children. But the laws of Cronius order thus: Whosoever shall behold any of the immortals, when the god himself chooses not, at a heavy price shall he behold."[^call-law] She compared his fate to the far worse one awaiting [Actaeon](actaeon.md), who would see [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md) bathing and be devoured by his own dogs: "Happiest of women shall she call thee and of happy fate, for that thou didst receive thy son home from the hills — blind."[^call-actaeon]

As compensation, Athena promised: "I will make him a seer to be sung of men hereafter, yea, more excellent than any other. He shall know the birds — which is of good omen among all the countless birds that fly and what birds are of ill-omened flight." She also gave him "a great staff which shall guide his feet" and "a long term of life." Most remarkably: "He only, when he dies, shall walk among the dead having understanding, honoured of the great Leader of Peoples."[^call-gifts]

[^call-law]: "It is not I that made thy child blind. For no sweet thing is it for Athena to snatch away the eyes of children. But the laws of Cronius order thus: Whosoever shall behold any of the immortals, when the god himself chooses not, at a heavy price shall he behold" (Callimachus, Hymn V.97-102)
[^call-actaeon]: "Happiest of women shall she call thee and of happy fate, for that thou didst receive thy son home from the hills — blind" (Callimachus, Hymn V.120-121)
[^call-gifts]: "I will make him a seer to be sung of men hereafter, yea, more excellent than any other. He shall know the birds... Also will I give him a great staff which shall guide his feet as he hath need, and I will give him a long term of life. And he only, when he dies, shall walk among the dead having understanding, honoured of the great Leader of Peoples" (Callimachus, Hymn V.121-130)

## In the Metamorphoses

Ovid retells the sex-change story: Teiresias struck two copulating serpents and was transformed into a woman for seven years, then struck them again and became a man. Called to arbitrate between Jupiter and Juno, "he took the side of Jove," and Juno in anger "condemned the arbitrator to perpetual blindness." Jupiter compensated him "by granting him the knowledge of the future."[^met3-teiresias]
