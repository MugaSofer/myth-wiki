## Overview

**Daphne** was a river nymph, daughter of the river god Peneus, who was transformed into a laurel tree to escape the pursuit of [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md). Her transformation established the laurel as Apollo's sacred tree.

### Cupid's Arrows

Daphne's fate was set not by chance but by Cupid's revenge. After [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) mocked Cupid's bow, the love god struck back with two arrows of opposite effect: "one love exciting, one repelling love. The dart of love was glittering, gold and sharp, the other had a blunted tip of lead."[^met-daphne-1] Apollo was pierced with the golden arrow and fell into passionate love, while Daphne was struck with lead and rejected all desire.

### The Maiden's Vow

Daphne devoted herself to virginity in imitation of [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md), binding her hair with a simple fillet and carrying a bow. When her father Peneus pressed her to marry and give him grandchildren, she clung to him and pleaded: "My dearest father let me live a virgin always, for remember Jove did grant it to Diana at her birth."[^met-daphne-2] Her father consented, but Ovid notes ominously that "her loveliness prevailed against their will."[^met-daphne-3]

### Apollo's Pursuit

Apollo pursued Daphne with a long entreaty, declaring his divine credentials and the futility of her flight: "I am no enemy that follows thee—why, so the lamb leaps from the raging wolf, and from the lion runs the timid faun... all hasten from their natural enemy but I alone pursue for my dear love."[^met-daphne-4] He catalogued his divine domains — Delphi, Patara, Claros, Tenedos — and confessed the irony that the god of medicine could not cure his own wound: "all the arts that save have failed their lord."[^met-daphne-5]

### The Transformation

When Apollo's pursuit reached its crisis, Daphne cried out to her father's waters: "Help me my father, if thy flowing streams have virtue! Cover me, O mother Earth! Destroy the beauty that has injured me, or change the body that destroys my life." The transformation was immediate: "a thin bark closed around her gentle bosom, and her hair became as moving leaves; her arms were changed to waving branches, and her active feet as clinging roots were fastened to the ground."[^met-daphne-6]

### Apollo and the Laurel

Even after the transformation, Apollo continued to love the tree. He "felt her bosom throbbing in the bark" and "fondly kissed the wood that shrank from every kiss." He claimed the laurel as his own sacred tree: "thou shalt be called my chosen tree, and thy green leaves, O Laurel! shall forever crown my brows, be wreathed around my quiver and my lyre; the Roman heroes shall be crowned with thee."[^met-daphne-7] The laurel bent its boughs in response — a nod that seemed to answer his love.

[^met-daphne-1]: "one love exciting, one repelling love. The dart of love was glittering, gold and sharp, the other had a blunted tip of lead; and with that dull lead dart he shot the Nymph, but with the keen point of the golden dart he pierced the bone and marrow of the God" (Metamorphoses 1.468-473, trans. Brookes More)

[^met-daphne-7]: "thou shalt be called my chosen tree, and thy green leaves, O Laurel! shall forever crown my brows, be wreathed around my quiver and my lyre; the Roman heroes shall be crowned with thee" (Metamorphoses 1.557-563, trans. Brookes More)
