# Hector

> "Surely I take thought for all these things, my wife; but I have very sore shame of the Trojans and Trojan dames with trailing robes, if like a coward I shrink away from battle. Moreover mine own soul forbiddeth me, seeing I have learnt ever to be valiant and fight in the forefront of the Trojans, winning my father's great glory and mine own."[^epigraph]

## Overview

**Hector** was the greatest warrior of [Troy](../places/troy.md) and the eldest son of King [Priam](priam.md) and [Hecuba](hecuba.md). As commander of the Trojan forces, he was the primary defender of the city and the chief opponent of the Greek heroes throughout the [Trojan War](../events/trojan-war.md). He was slain by [Achilles](achilles.md) in single combat before the walls of Troy.

## Epithets

Hector's most common Homeric epithet is **"of the glancing helm"** (or "glancing plume"), used throughout the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md).[^il2-helm] He is also called **"horse-taming Hector"**,[^il22-horse] **"great Hector,"**[^il2-great] and **"peer of Zeus in counsel."**[^il7-peer] [Athena](../deities/athena.md) calls him **"peer of Enyalios warrior of the waving helm"** when disguised as Deiphobos, comparing him to the god of war.[^il22-enyalios]

[Hecuba](hecuba.md) calls him a **"blessing to all, both men and women of Troy throughout the town, who hailed thee as a god."**[^il22-god]

In the [Fabulae](../sources/fabulae.md), he is called **"the great illustrious Hector"** and is listed among those who killed enemy princes.[^hyg-great]

## Appearance

The [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) gives a vivid image of Hector in his armour: "the black hide beat on either side against his ankles and his neck, even the rim that ran uttermost about his bossed shield."[^il6-shield] His helmet had a horse-hair crest so fearsome that his own infant son Astyanax "shrunk crying to the bosom of his fair-girdled nurse, dismayed at his dear father's aspect, and in dread at the bronze and horse-hair crest that he beheld nodding fiercely from the helmet's top."[^il6-crest]

After his death, the Greeks "gazed upon the stature and marvellous goodliness of Hector."[^il22-goodliness]

When he donned the divine armour stripped from [Patroclus](patroclus.md), "the armour fitted itself unto Hector's body" and "in the flashing of his armour he seemed to all of them like unto Peleus' great-hearted son."[^il17-armour]

[^il6-shield]: "the black hide beat on either side against his ankles and his neck, even the rim that ran uttermost about his bossed shield" (Iliad VI.3568-3570)
[^il6-crest]: "the child shrunk crying to the bosom of his fair-girdled nurse, dismayed at his dear father's aspect, and in dread at the bronze and horse-hair crest that he beheld nodding fiercely from the helmet's top" (Iliad VI.3899-3901)
[^il22-goodliness]: "sons of Achaians ran up around, who gazed upon the stature and marvellous goodliness of Hector" (Iliad XXII.12626-12627)
[^il17-armour]: "the armour fitted itself unto Hector's body, and Ares the dread war-god entered into him, and his limbs were filled within with valour and strength [...] in the flashing of his armour he seemed to all of them like unto Peleus' great-hearted son" (Iliad XVII.10120-10124)

## In the Iliad

### Commander of Troy

Hector led the Trojan forces throughout the war. In the Catalogue of Trojans, he is introduced as leader of the largest contingent: "Amid the Trojans great Hector of the glancing helm was leader, the son of Priam; with him the greatest hosts by far and the goodliest were arrayed, eager warriors of the spear."[^il2-leader]

[^il2-leader]: "Amid the Trojans great Hector of the glancing helm was leader, the son of Priam; with him the greatest hosts by far and the goodliest were arrayed, eager warriors of the spear" (Iliad II.1542-1544)

### Farewell to Andromache (Book VI)

In one of the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md)'s most celebrated scenes, Hector returned to Troy to bid the women pray to the gods. At the Scaian gates, Andromache met him with their infant son. She pleaded with him to stay, recounting how [Achilles](achilles.md) had already killed her father and seven brothers. Hector refused, driven by shame: "I have very sore shame of the Trojans and Trojan dames with trailing robes, if like a coward I shrink away from battle."[^il6-shame]

He acknowledged Troy's coming destruction — "Yea of a surety I know this in heart and soul; the day shall come for holy Ilios to be laid low" — yet his deepest anguish was for Andromache: "doth the anguish of the Trojans hereafter not so much trouble me [...] as doth thine anguish in the day when some mail-clad Achaian shall lead thee weeping and rob thee of the light of freedom."[^il6-anguish]

When their son Astyanax cried in fear at his helmet's crest, "his dear father laughed aloud, and his lady mother; forthwith glorious Hector took the helmet from his head, and laid it, all gleaming, upon the earth; then kissed he his dear son and dandled him in his arms."[^il6-child] He prayed that his son would surpass him: "Far greater is he than his father."[^il6-prayer]

[^il6-shame]: "I have very sore shame of the Trojans and Trojan dames with trailing robes, if like a coward I shrink away from battle. Moreover mine own soul forbiddeth me, seeing I have learnt ever to be valiant and fight in the forefront of the Trojans" (Iliad VI.3877-3880)
[^il6-anguish]: "Yea of a surety I know this in heart and soul; the day shall come for holy Ilios to be laid low, and Priam and the folk of Priam of the good ashen spear. Yet doth the anguish of the Trojans hereafter not so much trouble me [...] as doth thine anguish in the day when some mail-clad Achaian shall lead thee weeping and rob thee of the light of freedom" (Iliad VI.3881-3887)
[^il6-child]: "his dear father laughed aloud, and his lady mother; forthwith glorious Hector took the helmet from his head, and laid it, all gleaming, upon the earth; then kissed he his dear son and dandled him in his arms" (Iliad VI.3902-3904)
[^il6-prayer]: "O Zeus and all ye gods, vouchsafe ye that this my son may likewise prove even as I, pre-eminent amid the Trojans, and as valiant in might, and be a great king of Ilios. Then may men say of him, 'Far greater is he than his father' as he returneth home from battle" (Iliad VI.3905-3909)

### Duel with Ajax (Book VII)

Hector challenged the bravest Greek to single combat. The lot fell on [Ajax](ajax.md), and the two fought until nightfall, when heralds parted them. They exchanged gifts: Hector gave Ajax a silver-studded sword, and Ajax gave Hector a purple war-belt.[^il7-duel]

[^il7-duel]: "Hector of the glancing helm soon find his combat [...] the lot fell on Ajax" (Iliad VII.4104, cf. 4176-4230)

### Assault on the Ships (Books XII-XVI)

Hector breached the Greek wall and drove the fighting to the ships themselves. He set fire to the ship of Protesilaus, forcing [Achilles](achilles.md) to send [Patroclus](patroclus.md) out in his armour.[^il-assault] Hector slew Patroclus — who had first been wounded by Euphorbus and struck by [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) — and stripped the divine armour from his body.[^il16-patslain]

[^il-assault]: "Hector made a breach in the wall and entered and, Ajax having retreated, he set fire to the ships" (Epitome 4.5)
[^il16-patslain]: "Hector, when he had stripped from Patroklos his noble armour, was dragging him thence that he might cut off the head from the shoulders with the keen bronze" (Iliad XVII.10083-10085)

### Donning Achilles' Armour (Book XVII)

After stripping [Patroclus](patroclus.md), Hector put on the divine armour of [Achilles](achilles.md). [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md), watching from above, pitied him: "Ah, hapless man, no thought is in thy heart of death that yet draweth nigh unto thee; thou doest on thee the divine armour of a peerless man before whom the rest have terror." Zeus granted him temporary might — "for a while at least I will give into thy hands great might" — but decreed he would never return home.[^il17-zeus]

[^il17-zeus]: "Ah, hapless man, no thought is in thy heart of death that yet draweth nigh unto thee; thou doest on thee the divine armour of a peerless man before whom the rest have terror. His comrade, gentle and brave, thou hast slain, and unmeetly hast stripped the armour from his head and shoulders; yet now for a while at least I will give into thy hands great might, in recompense for this, even that nowise shalt thou come home out of the battle, for Andromache to receive from thee Peleides' glorious arms" (Iliad XVII.10109-10116)

### Death at the Hands of Achilles (Book XXII)

Hector alone remained outside Troy's walls to face [Achilles](achilles.md), though when Achilles charged — "all around the bronze on him flashed like the gleam of blazing fire or of the Sun as he ariseth" — "trembling seized Hector as he was aware of him," and he fled.[^il22-flight] Achilles pursued him three times around the walls of Troy.

[Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) weighed their fates in golden scales: "Then Hector's fated day sank down, and fell to the house of Hades, and Phoebus Apollo left him."[^il22-scales] [Athena](../deities/athena.md) then deceived Hector by appearing as his brother Deiphobos, encouraging him to stand and fight. When Hector turned to face Achilles, he proposed a covenant to respect the loser's body. Achilles refused: "As between men and lions there is no pledge of faith."[^il22-covenant]

Their spears missed — Hector's bounced off Achilles' shield, and Athena returned Achilles' spear to him unseen. When Hector called to Deiphobos for a second spear and found no one there, he understood: "Ay me, now verily the gods have summoned me to death [...] it was Athene who played me false."[^il22-realise] He resolved to die fighting: "At least let me not die without a struggle or ingloriously, but in some great deed of arms whereof men yet to be born shall hear."[^il22-resolve]

Drawing his sword, he charged, but Achilles drove his spear through the gap at Hector's throat, "yet the bronze-weighted ashen spear clave not the windpipe, so that he might yet speak words of answer to his foe."[^il22-death] Dying, Hector begged Achilles to return his body; Achilles refused. With his last words, Hector prophesied Achilles' own death: "Take heed now lest I draw upon thee wrath of gods, in the day when Paris and Phoebus Apollo slay thee, for all thy valour, at the Skaian gate."[^il22-prophecy]

[^il22-flight]: "trembling seized Hector as he was aware of him, nor endured he to abide in his place, but left the gates behind him and fled in fear" (Iliad XXII.12416-12418)
[^il22-scales]: "two lots of dreary death, one of Achilles, one of horse-taming Hector, and held them by the midst and poised. Then Hector's fated day sank down, and fell to the house of Hades, and Phoebus Apollo left him" (Iliad XXII.12480-12482)
[^il22-covenant]: "As between men and lions there is no pledge of faith, nor wolves and sheep can be of one mind, but imagine evil continually against each other, so is it impossible for thee and me to be friends" (Iliad XXII.12527-12530)
[^il22-realise]: "Ay me, now verily the gods have summoned me to death. I deemed the warrior Deiphobos was by my side, but he is within the wall, and it was Athene who played me false" (Iliad XXII.12561-12563)
[^il22-resolve]: "At least let me not die without a struggle or ingloriously, but in some great deed of arms whereof men yet to be born shall hear" (Iliad XXII.12567-12568)
[^il22-death]: "right through the tender neck went the point. Yet the bronze-weighted ashen spear clave not the windpipe, so that he might yet speak words of answer to his foe" (Iliad XXII.12586-12589)
[^il22-prophecy]: "Take heed now lest I draw upon thee wrath of gods, in the day when Paris and Phoebus Apollo slay thee, for all thy valour, at the Skaian gate" (Iliad XXII.12614-12616)

### Desecration and Ransom (Books XXII-XXIV)

Achilles bound Hector's body to his chariot: "The tendons of both feet behind he slit from heel to ankle-joint, and thrust therethrough thongs of ox-hide, and bound him to his chariot, leaving his head to trail."[^il22-drag] He dragged him around [Patroclus](patroclus.md)' barrow daily, but [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) preserved the body: "Apollo kept away all defacement from his flesh, for he had pity on him even in death, and covered him all with his golden aegis."[^il24-apollo]

In Book XXIV, [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) commanded that Hector's body be returned, and [Priam](priam.md) journeyed to the Greek camp guided by [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md). Achilles accepted ransom and returned the body. The Trojans mourned and buried Hector.[^il24-ransom]

[^il22-drag]: "The tendons of both feet behind he slit from heel to ankle-joint, and thrust therethrough thongs of ox-hide, and bound him to his chariot, leaving his head to trail" (Iliad XXII.12649-12651)
[^il24-apollo]: "Apollo kept away all defacement from his flesh, for he had pity on him even in death, and covered him all with his golden aegis, that Achilles might not tear him when he dragged him" (Iliad XXIV.13517-13519)
[^il24-ransom]: "Priam came to Achilles and ransomed the body of Hector, and buried it" (Epitome 4.7)

## In the Bibliotheca

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) records that Hector was the first son of [Priam](priam.md) and [Hecuba](hecuba.md), and that he married Andromache, daughter of Eetion.[^apd-birth] He killed Protesilaus, the first Greek to land at Troy.[^apd-prot] He challenged the bravest Greeks to single combat, and the lot fell on [Ajax](ajax.md).[^apd-ajax] He breached the Greek wall and set fire to the ships.[^apd-wall] He slew [Patroclus](patroclus.md), after Patroclus was first wounded by Euphorbus.[^apd-pat] [Achilles](achilles.md) then "slew Hector in single combat, and fastening his ankles to his chariot dragged him to the ships."[^apd-death]

[^apd-birth]: "The first son born to her was Hector" (Bibliotheca 3.12.5); "Hector married Andromache, daughter of Eetion" (Bibliotheca 3.12.6)
[^apd-prot]: "Protesilaus, and having slain not a few of the barbarians, he fell by the hand of Hector" (Epitome 3.30)
[^apd-ajax]: "Hector having challenged the bravest to single combat, many came forward, but the lot fell on Ajax" (Epitome 4.2)
[^apd-wall]: "Hector made a breach in the wall and entered and, Ajax having retreated, he set fire to the ships" (Epitome 4.5)
[^apd-pat]: "was himself killed by Hector, after being first wounded by Euphorbus" (Epitome 4.6)
[^apd-death]: "Achilles slew Hector in single combat, and fastening his ankles to his chariot dragged him to the ships" (Epitome 4.7)

## In the Fabulae

The [Fabulae](../sources/fabulae.md) lists Hector first among the sons and daughters of [Priam](priam.md).[^hyg-sons] In the summary of the ransom, the text gives a compressed account of the entire arc: [Achilles](achilles.md) refused to return the body until [Priam](priam.md), "with Mercury as guide, came into the camp of the Danaans, received the body for an equal weight of gold, and gave it burial."[^hyg-ransom]

The Fabulae also records the exchange of gifts with [Ajax](ajax.md): "Ajax gave Hector the belt by which he was dragged, and Hector gave Ajax a sword with which he killed himself" — each gift becoming the instrument of the other's death.[^hyg-gifts]

[^hyg-sons]: "Sons and Daughters of Priam to the number of LV: Hector, Deiphobus, Cebriones..." (Fabulae 90)
[^hyg-ransom]: "Priam, with Mercury as guide, came into the camp of the Danaans, received the body for an equal weight of gold, and gave it burial" (Fabulae 106)
[^hyg-gifts]: "Ajax gave Hector the belt by which he was dragged, and Hector gave Ajax a sword with which he killed himself" (Fabulae 112)

## In the Metamorphoses

In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md), Hector is introduced through his brother Aesacus: "Aesacus was the brother of the great illustrious Hector; and, if he had not been victimized by a strange fate in youth, he would have equalled Hector's glorious fame."[^met-aesacus] The text notes the distinction of parentage: "Hector was child of Hecuba," while Aesacus' mother was Alexirhoe.[^met-parentage]

[^met-aesacus]: "Aesacus was the brother of the great illustrious Hector; and, if he had not been victimized by a strange fate in youth, he would have equalled Hector's glorious fame" (Metamorphoses 11.760-763, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-parentage]: "Hector was child of Hecuba, who was daughter of Dymas" (Metamorphoses 11.763-764)
