## Overview

**Antigone** was a daughter of [Oedipus](../heroes/oedipus.md) and [Jocasta](../heroes/jocasta.md), and sister to [Ismene](../heroes/ismene.md), [Polyneices](../heroes/polyneices.md), and [Eteocles](../heroes/eteocles.md). She served as her blind father's guide during his exile and is best known for defying [Creon](../heroes/creon.md)'s edict by burying her brother Polyneices, an act for which she was condemned to death.

## In the Bibliotheca

Apollodorus mentions Antigone as one of Oedipus's four children by Jocasta.[^apd-children] After Oedipus blinded himself and was driven from [Thebes](../places/thebes.md), "with Antigone he came to Colonus in Attica, where the precinct of the Eumenides stands, sat as a suppliant, was kindly received by [Theseus](../heroes/theseus.md), and died not long afterwards."[^apd-colonus]

In the aftermath of the [Seven against Thebes](../events/seven-against-thebes.md), "Antigone, the sister of Polyneices, secretly stole the body of Polyneices and buried it," and was caught by Creon. She was "interred alive in the tomb."[^apd-burial]

## In Sophocles' Oedipus the King

Antigone appears at the end of the play as a young child. After blinding himself, Oedipus begs [Creon](../heroes/creon.md) to care for his daughters, who are brought to him for a final embrace.[^sot-daughters]

## In Sophocles' Oedipus at Colonus

Antigone serves as her blind father's guide throughout his exile, leading him to the sacred grove of the [Eumenides](../creatures/erinyes.md) at Colonus. Her opening words establish her role: "Father, poor worn Oedipus, / What towers are those our eyes behold?" (~2-3).[^soc-opening] Oedipus praises her devotion, contrasting her with his ungrateful sons: "They tend me, they preserve me, they are men / Not women in true service to their sire" (~5838-5840).[^soc-praise]

When Creon seizes both Antigone and Ismene by force, [Theseus](../heroes/theseus.md) rescues them. In their father's final moments, Antigone and Ismene wash and dress him. He embraces them and says farewell: "My children, ye will lose your sire today... yet one word / Wipes out all score of tribulations—_love_" (~1613-1617).[^soc-farewell] After Oedipus's mysterious death, Antigone begs Theseus to reveal the grave's location, but he refuses, bound by his promise to Oedipus.[^soc-grave]

## In Sophocles' Antigone

### The Defiance

After the mutual fratricide of [Polyneices](../heroes/polyneices.md) and [Eteocles](../heroes/eteocles.md), Creon decrees that Eteocles shall be buried with honor while Polyneices "must lie unwept, unsepulchred, a feast / Of flesh for keen-eyed carrion birds" (~29-30).[^sa-edict] Antigone resolves to bury Polyneices despite the decree. When [Ismene](../heroes/ismene.md) refuses to help, citing their weakness against "a monarch's will," Antigone responds: "I will bury him myself. / And even if I die in the act, that death will be a glory" (~71-72).[^sa-resolve]

### The Defense

Caught performing the burial rites, Antigone is brought before Creon. She delivers her famous defense of divine over human law: "Yea, for these laws were not ordained of Zeus, / And she who sits enthroned with gods below, / Justice, enacted not these human laws. / Nor did I deem that thou, a mortal man, / Could'st by a breath annul and override / The immutable unwritten laws of Heaven. / They were not born today nor yesterday; / They die not; and none knoweth whence they sprang."[^sa-laws] She accepts death willingly: "death is gain to him whose life, like mine, / Is full of misery" (~680-681).[^sa-death-gain]

When Creon calls her defiant, she replies: "My nature is for mutual love, not hate" (~523).[^sa-love]

### Condemnation and Death

Creon sentences Antigone to be sealed alive in a rock-hewn tomb. Led to her death, she laments that she goes unwed and childless: "No bridal bed, no bridal song for me, / And since no wedding, so no child to rear" (~917-918).[^sa-lament] She explains why a brother's claim surpassed all others: "A husband dead, I might have found another... / But since my father and my mother sleep / In Hades, I can never have / A brother more" (~909-912).[^sa-brother]

A messenger later reports that she was found in the tomb "hanged, by the neck, / Suspended by her linen scarf" (~1222-1223).[^sa-death] [Haemon](../heroes/haemon.md), finding her, killed himself at her side.

## In the Fabulae

Hyginus records that after the [Seven against Thebes](../events/seven-against-thebes.md), "Antigone and Argeia secretly carried the body of Polyneices by night and placed it on the pyre on which Eteocles was burning. When caught by Creon's guards, Argeia escaped but Antigone was brought before Creon."[^hyg-burial] He gave her to Haemon to execute, but Haemon "entrusted her to shepherds," and she bore him a son. When the son came to Thebes and was recognized by a birthmark, Heracles interceded but Creon would not relent, and "Haemon killed himself and his wife Antigone."[^hyg-haemon]

## In Euripides' Phoenissae

At the end of the play, after the mutual fratricide of her brothers and Jocasta's suicide, Antigone confronts Creon's edict against burying Polyneices and chooses exile with her blinded father rather than marriage to Haemon.[^phoen-exile]
