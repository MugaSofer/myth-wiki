## Overview

**Hecuba** is the wife of Priam and queen of [Troy](../places/troy.md). In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md), her story after Troy's fall is one of Ovid's most sustained portraits of grief — the loss of her children one by one, culminating in savage revenge and transformation into a howling dog.

## In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md)

### The Fall of Troy (13.404-428)

After Troy falls, Hecuba witnesses the worst: "Jove's altar drank old Priam's scanty blood." Cassandra, "the priestess of [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md)," is "dragged by her long hair, while up towards heaven she lifted supplicating hands in vain." The Trojan women are carried off as spoil, and Astyanax is "hurled down from the very tower from which he often had looked forth and seen his father, by his mother pointed out, when Hector fought for honor and his country's weal."[^met-hec-fall]

### Polyxena's Sacrifice (13.440-480)

[Achilles](achilles.md)' ghost rose from the earth on the Thracian shore, "as large as when he lived," and demanded the sacrifice of Polyxena. The girl was "torn from her mother's bosom" and led to the altar, where she showed extraordinary courage: "Do not delay my generous gift of blood, with no resistance thrust the ready steel into my throat or breast! Polyxena would never wish to live in slavery."[^met-hec-polyxena]

She asked only that her body be returned to her mother: "King Priam's daughter, not a captive, pleads — freely return my body to my mother, let her not pay with gold for the sad right to bury me — but only with her tears!" Even the priest wept as he drove the steel into her breast, but "no one saw her shed one tear." Dying, "it was her care to cover all that ought to be concealed, and save the value of chaste modesty."[^met-hec-modesty]

### Hecuba's Lament (13.481-535)

[Odysseus](odysseus.md) claimed Hecuba as his prize "only because she had brought Hector forth." She embraced Polyxena's body and "bathed her daughter's wounds with tears and kissed them with her lips." Her lament catalogues her losses: "But lately on the pinnacle of fame, surrounded by my powerful sons-in-law, daughters, and daughters-in-law, and strong in my great husband, I am exiled now, and destitute, and forced from the sad tombs of those I love, to wretched slavery."[^met-hec-lament]

She imagined serving Penelope on Ithaca: "Look at that woman who was widely known, the mother of great Hector, once the wife of Priam!" Yet she clung to one hope — her youngest son Polydorus, sent to the Thracian king Polymnestor for safekeeping.[^met-hec-penelope]

### Polydorus and Revenge (13.535-564)

Going to the shore to draw water, Hecuba found the body of Polydorus, "killed, disfigured with deep wounds of Thracian swords." Polymnestor had murdered his ward for gold. "She was struck dumb with her agony, which quite consumed both voice and tears within her heart — rigid and still she seemed as a hard rock."[^met-hec-polydorus]

Then "she arms herself and draws up all her wrath. It burned as if she still held regal power." Like "a lioness rages when plundered of her suckling cub," she lured Polymnestor with a false promise of hidden gold. When he came, "she flew at him and drove her fingers deep in his perfidious eyes; and tore them from his face — and plunged her hands into the raw and bleeding sockets (passion made her strong)."[^met-hec-revenge]

### Transformation (13.565-575)

The Thracians attacked her with stones and darts, "but she with hoarse growling and snapping jaws sprang at the stones, and, when she tried to speak, she barked like a fierce dog. The place still bears a name suggested by her hideous change." She ran "howling dismally in Thracian fields."[^met-hec-dog]

"Her sad fate moved the Trojans and the Greeks, her friends and foes, and all the heavenly gods. Yes all, for even the sister-wife of Jove denied that Hecuba deserved such fate."[^met-hec-pity]

[^met-hec-fall]: "Jove's altar drank old Priam's scanty blood. The priestess of Apollo then, alas! Was dragged by her long hair... Astyanax was hurled down from the very tower from which he often had looked forth and seen his father, by his mother pointed out, when Hector fought for honor and his country's weal" (Metamorphoses 13.404-420, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-hec-polyxena]: "Do not delay my generous gift of blood, with no resistance thrust the ready steel into my throat or breast!... Polyxena would never wish to live in slavery" (Metamorphoses 13.457-473, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-hec-modesty]: "even unto death, it was her care to cover all that ought to be concealed, and save the value of chaste modesty" (Metamorphoses 13.478-480, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-hec-lament]: "But lately on the pinnacle of fame, surrounded by my powerful sons-in-law, daughters, and daughters-in-law, and strong in my great husband, I am exiled now, and destitute, and forced from the sad tombs of those I love, to wretched slavery" (Metamorphoses 13.508-512, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-hec-penelope]: "serving Penelope: who showing me to curious dames of Ithaca, will point and say, while I am bending to my task, 'Look at that woman who was widely known, the mother of great Hector, once the wife of Priam!'" (Metamorphoses 13.513-518, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-hec-polydorus]: "she saw the corpse of her last son, thrown out upon the shore; her Polydorus, killed, disfigured with deep wounds of Thracian swords... she was struck dumb with her agony, which quite consumed both voice and tears within her heart — rigid and still she seemed as a hard rock" (Metamorphoses 13.535-542, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-hec-revenge]: "she flew at him and drove her fingers deep in his perfidious eyes; and tore them from his face — and plunged her hands into the raw and bleeding sockets (passion made her strong)" (Metamorphoses 13.560-566, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-hec-dog]: "she with hoarse growling and snapping jaws sprang at the stones, and, when she tried to speak, she barked like a fierce dog. The place still bears a name suggested by her hideous change" (Metamorphoses 13.569-572, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-hec-pity]: "Her sad fate moved the Trojans and the Greeks, her friends and foes, and all the heavenly gods. Yes all, for even the sister-wife of Jove denied that Hecuba deserved such fate" (Metamorphoses 13.573-575, trans. Brookes More)

## In Euripides' Hecuba

The [Hecuba](../sources/euripides-hecuba.md) dramatizes two linked tragedies after Troy's fall, with Hecuba as the central figure.

### The Sacrifice of Polyxena

[Achilles](achilles.md)' ghost appears above his tomb and demands Polyxena as a sacrifice: "having ascended o'er his tomb, he appeared in his golden arms and restrained the fleet ships... exclaiming... 'Where speed ye, Grecians, leaving my tomb unhonored!'"[^eur-hec-ghost] [Odysseus](odysseus.md) persuades the army to comply. Hecuba confronts Odysseus, reminding him of the time she saved his life when he came as a spy to Troy — an appeal to xenia. Odysseus acknowledges the debt but insists on honoring Achilles.

Polyxena refuses to beg for her life, declaring: "I die willingly; let none touch my body; for I will offer my neck to the sword with a good heart. But, by the Gods, let me go free while ye kill me, that I may die free, for to be classed as a slave among the dead, when a queen, is what I am ashamed of."[^eur-hec-free] At the altar, she bares her breast and speaks: "Lo! strike, if this bosom thou desirest, O youth; or wouldest thou rather under the neck, here is this throat prepared."[^eur-hec-strike] Even in death, "she showed much care to fall decently, and to veil from the eyes of men what ought to be concealed."[^eur-hec-modesty-eur]

### Murder of Polydorus and Revenge

Hecuba's attendant finds Polydorus's body washed up on shore — murdered by Polymestor, the Thracian king to whom Priam entrusted his youngest son with gold. Hecuba cries: "Where are the laws of hospitality? O most accurst of men!"[^eur-hec-xenia]

She appeals to [Agamemnon](agamemnon.md) for justice, arguing that "the Gods are strong, and strong the law, which governs them; for by the law we judge that there are Gods, and we live having justice and injustice strictly defined."[^eur-hec-law] Hecuba also reflects on universal bondage: "no mortal is there who is free. For either he is the slave of money or of fortune; or the populace of the city or the dictates of the law constrain him to adopt manners not accordant with his natural inclinations."[^eur-hec-slave]

With Agamemnon's tacit approval, Hecuba lures Polymestor into the captive women's tent. The Trojan women kill his sons with hidden daggers and gouge out his eyes with their brooches.

### Polymestor's Prophecies

The blinded Polymestor prophesies Hecuba's transformation: "Thou shalt become a dog with a fiery aspect... The tomb of the wretched dog, a mark to mariners."[^eur-hec-dog-prophecy] He also foretells Cassandra's death and Agamemnon's murder: "the murderous bath at Argos awaits thee."[^eur-hec-agamemnon] Agamemnon has him dragged away.

[^eur-hec-ghost]: "having ascended o'er his tomb, he appeared in his golden arms and restrained the fleet ships... exclaiming... 'Where speed ye, Grecians, leaving my tomb unhonored!'" (Hecuba 110-115, trans. T.A. Buckley)
[^eur-hec-free]: "I die willingly; let none touch my body; for I will offer my neck to the sword with a good heart. But, by the Gods, let me go free while ye kill me, that I may die free, for to be classed as a slave among the dead, when a queen, is what I am ashamed of" (Hecuba 548-552, trans. T.A. Buckley)
[^eur-hec-strike]: "Lo! strike, if this bosom thou desirest, O youth; or wouldest thou rather under the neck, here is this throat prepared" (Hecuba 563-565, trans. T.A. Buckley)
[^eur-hec-modesty-eur]: "she showed much care to fall decently, and to veil from the eyes of men what ought to be concealed" (Hecuba 569-570, trans. T.A. Buckley)
[^eur-hec-xenia]: "Where are the laws of hospitality? O most accurst of men, how didst thou mar that skin, how sever with the cruel sword the poor limbs of this boy, nor didst feel pity?" (Hecuba 714-720, trans. T.A. Buckley)
[^eur-hec-law]: "the Gods are strong, and strong the law, which governs them; for by the law we judge that there are Gods, and we live having justice and injustice strictly defined" (Hecuba 799-801, trans. T.A. Buckley)
[^eur-hec-slave]: "no mortal is there who is free. For either he is the slave of money or of fortune; or the populace of the city or the dictates of the law constrain him to adopt manners not accordant with his natural inclinations" (Hecuba 864-867, trans. T.A. Buckley)
[^eur-hec-dog-prophecy]: "Thou shalt become a dog with a fiery aspect... The tomb of the wretched dog, a mark to mariners" (Hecuba 1265-1273, trans. T.A. Buckley)
[^eur-hec-agamemnon]: "the murderous bath at Argos awaits thee" (Hecuba 1279, trans. T.A. Buckley)

## In the [Posthomerica](../sources/posthomerica.md)

### Enslavement (Book XIV)

After the sack of Troy, [Odysseus](odysseus.md) "dragged" Hecuba to his ship. "The tears poured from her eyes as water from a spring; trembled her limbs, fear-frenzied was her heart; rent were her hoary tresses and besprent with ashes of the hearth, cast by her hands when she saw [Priam](priam.md) slain and Troy aflame."[^post-hec-slave]

### Lament at Polyxena's Sacrifice (Book XIV)

When [Achilles](achilles.md)' ghost demanded the sacrifice of Polyxena, "yet sharper pain fell on the heart of hapless Hecuba." She recalled an ominous dream: "Herseemed that on Achilles' tomb she stood moaning, her hair down-streaming to the ground, and from her breasts blood dripped to earth the while." She wailed: "Ah me! what sorrows first or last shall I lament heart-anguished, who am full of woes?... a dead man's heart, Achilles' heart, is by our blood made warm with life to-day! O child, dear child, that I might die with thee."[^post-hec-polyxena]

### Transformation to Stone (Book XIV)

As the Greeks prepared to depart, "all-unhappy Priam's queen was changed from woman's form into a pitiful hound; and all men gathered round in wondering awe. Then all her body a God transformed to stone — a mighty marvel for men yet unborn!" At [Calchas](calchas.md)' bidding, the Greeks carried the stone across to the far side of the Hellespont.[^post-hec-stone]

[^post-hec-slave]: "Hecuba Odysseus dragged unto his ship. The tears poured from her eyes as water from a spring; trembled her limbs, fear-frenzied was her heart; rent were her hoary tresses and besprent with ashes of the hearth" (Posthomerica 14.10059-10064, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post-hec-polyxena]: "Herseemed that on Achilles' tomb she stood moaning, her hair down-streaming to the ground, and from her breasts blood dripped to earth... Ah me! what sorrows first or last shall I lament heart-anguished, who am full of woes?... a dead man's heart, Achilles' heart, is by our blood made warm with life to-day!" (Posthomerica 14.10347-10377)
[^post-hec-stone]: "all-unhappy Priam's queen was changed from woman's form into a pitiful hound; and all men gathered round in wondering awe. Then all her body a God transformed to stone — a mighty marvel for men yet unborn!" (Posthomerica 14.10428-10432)

## In Euripides' Trojan Women

The [Trojan Women](../sources/euripides-trojan-women.md) places Hecuba at the centre of every scene, enduring loss upon loss in the immediate aftermath of Troy's fall.

### Awakening Amid the Ruins

Hecuba lies on the ground before the Greek ships as the play opens. She was queen of [Troy](../places/troy.md); now she describes herself as "a winter-frozen bee, a slave death-shapen, as the stones that lie hewn on a dead man's grave."[^tw-hec-slave] She calls the other captive women from their huts, comparing herself to "a wide-wing'd bird" calling its flock.

### The Lots

The herald Talthybius announces the division of captives. [Cassandra](cassandra.md) has been taken as [Agamemnon](agamemnon.md)'s concubine; [Andromache](andromache.md) is given to [Neoptolemus](neoptolemus.md). [Polyxena](polyxena.md) "rests apart, to watch [Achilles](achilles.md)' tomb" — Talthybius euphemistically tells Hecuba to "count thy maid happy," concealing that the girl has been sacrificed. Hecuba herself falls to [Odysseus](odysseus.md): "A lying man and a pitiless shall be lord of me, a heart full-flown with scorn of righteousness."[^tw-hec-odysseus]

### Cassandra's Madness

When [Cassandra](cassandra.md) emerges bearing a torch and singing wildly of her "wedding" to Agamemnon, Hecuba can only mourn: "How little dreamed I then of wars or red spears of the Greek to lay thy bridal bed!" She takes the torch from her daughter's hands.

### The Death of Astyanax

[Andromache](andromache.md) reveals that Polyxena has been slain: "Polyxena across [Achilles](achilles.md)' tomb lies slain, a gift flung to the dreamless dead." Hecuba responds: "My sorrow!... 'Tis but what Talthybius said: so plain a riddle, and I read it not."[^tw-hec-riddle] She counsels Andromache to accept her new master for the sake of [Astyanax](astyanax.md) — "rear this babe among his foes, my [Hector](hector.md)'s child, to manhood and great aid for Ilion." But Talthybius returns with the decree: by [Odysseus](odysseus.md)'s counsel, Astyanax must be hurled from Troy's walls.

### The Trial of Helen

When [Menelaus](menelaus.md) arrives to claim [Helen](helen.md), Hecuba urges him to kill her but warns: "fear to see her visage, lest she snare thee and thou fall! She snareth strong men's eyes; she snareth tall cities."[^tw-hec-snare] After Helen blames [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md) and the Judgement of [Paris](paris.md) for her flight, Hecuba demolishes every argument: the goddesses would not have bartered their own cities for vanity; Helen's own desire was the "Aphrodite" that drove her — "My son was passing beautiful... and thine own heart, that saw and conned his face, became a spirit enchanting thee. For all wild things that in mortality have being, are Aphroditê."[^tw-hec-aphrodite] She charges that Helen never cried for help, never attempted escape, and dressed in finery rather than mourning. She concludes: "Slay this woman, and upraise the law for evermore."

### Lament Over Astyanax

Talthybius returns bearing the dead child on [Hector](hector.md)'s great shield. Hecuba prepares the tiny body for burial, delivering one of the play's most devastating speeches: "There lieth here a babe whom the Greeks feared, and in their fear slew him."[^tw-hec-epitaph] She recalls how Astyanax had once promised: "Grandmother, when thou art dead, I will cut close my hair and lead out all the captains to ride by thy tomb."[^tw-hec-promise]

### The Burning of Troy

As the city is set ablaze, Hecuba cries: "O thou whose breath was mighty on the swell of orient winds, my Troy! Even thy name shall soon be taken from thee." She springs toward the flames to die with her city but is seized and held by soldiers.[^tw-hec-flames] She is led away to the ships as Odysseus's slave.

[^tw-hec-slave]: "a winter-frozen bee, a slave death-shapen, as the stones that lie hewn on a dead man's grave" (Trojan Women, trans. Gilbert Murray)
[^tw-hec-odysseus]: "A lying man and a pitiless shall be lord of me, a heart full-flown with scorn of righteousness" (Trojan Women, trans. Gilbert Murray)
[^tw-hec-riddle]: "'Tis but what Talthybius said: so plain a riddle, and I read it not" (Trojan Women, trans. Gilbert Murray)
[^tw-hec-snare]: "fear to see her visage, lest she snare thee and thou fall! She snareth strong men's eyes; she snareth tall cities" (Trojan Women, trans. Gilbert Murray)
[^tw-hec-aphrodite]: "My son was passing beautiful... and thine own heart, that saw and conned his face, became a spirit enchanting thee. For all wild things that in mortality have being, are Aphroditê" (Trojan Women, trans. Gilbert Murray)
[^tw-hec-epitaph]: "There lieth here a babe whom the Greeks feared, and in their fear slew him" (Trojan Women, trans. Gilbert Murray)
[^tw-hec-promise]: "Grandmother, when thou art dead, I will cut close my hair and lead out all the captains to ride by thy tomb" (Trojan Women, trans. Gilbert Murray)
[^tw-hec-flames]: "O thou whose breath was mighty on the swell of orient winds, my Troy! Even thy name shall soon be taken from thee... Quick, to the flames! O, in thine agony, my Troy, mine own, take me to die with thee!" (Trojan Women, trans. Gilbert Murray)

## Variant Traditions

All three sources agree on Hecuba's transformation into a dog, but differ in the details:

- In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md), Hecuba is transformed while still alive, as a consequence of her frenzy after blinding Polymestor — she snaps and growls at Thracians throwing stones, and when she tries to speak she barks.
- In Euripides' [Hecuba](../sources/euripides-hecuba.md), the transformation is only prophesied by the blinded Polymestor: she will become "a dog with a fiery aspect" and her tomb "a mark to mariners."
- In the [Posthomerica](../sources/posthomerica.md), the transformation happens in two stages — first into a "pitiful hound," then a god turns her entire body to stone — and the petrified form is carried across the Hellespont.
