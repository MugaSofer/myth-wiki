## Overview

**Hecuba** is the wife of Priam and queen of [Troy](../places/troy.md). In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md), her story after Troy's fall is one of Ovid's most sustained portraits of grief — the loss of her children one by one, culminating in savage revenge and transformation into a howling dog.

## In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md)

### The Fall of Troy (13.404-428)

After Troy falls, Hecuba witnesses the worst: "Jove's altar drank old Priam's scanty blood." Cassandra, "the priestess of [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md)," is "dragged by her long hair, while up towards heaven she lifted supplicating hands in vain." The Trojan women are carried off as spoil, and Astyanax is "hurled down from the very tower from which he often had looked forth and seen his father, by his mother pointed out, when Hector fought for honor and his country's weal."[^met-hec-fall]

### Polyxena's Sacrifice (13.440-480)

[Achilles](achilles.md)' ghost rose from the earth on the Thracian shore, "as large as when he lived," and demanded the sacrifice of Polyxena. The girl was "torn from her mother's bosom" and led to the altar, where she showed extraordinary courage: "Do not delay my generous gift of blood, with no resistance thrust the ready steel into my throat or breast! Polyxena would never wish to live in slavery."[^met-hec-polyxena]

She asked only that her body be returned to her mother: "King Priam's daughter, not a captive, pleads — freely return my body to my mother, let her not pay with gold for the sad right to bury me — but only with her tears!" Even the priest wept as he drove the steel into her breast, but "no one saw her shed one tear." Dying, "it was her care to cover all that ought to be concealed, and save the value of chaste modesty."[^met-hec-modesty]

### Hecuba's Lament (13.481-535)

[Odysseus](odysseus.md) claimed Hecuba as his prize "only because she had brought Hector forth." She embraced Polyxena's body and "bathed her daughter's wounds with tears and kissed them with her lips." Her lament catalogues her losses: "But lately on the pinnacle of fame, surrounded by my powerful sons-in-law, daughters, and daughters-in-law, and strong in my great husband, I am exiled now, and destitute, and forced from the sad tombs of those I love, to wretched slavery."[^met-hec-lament]

She imagined serving Penelope on Ithaca: "Look at that woman who was widely known, the mother of great Hector, once the wife of Priam!" Yet she clung to one hope — her youngest son Polydorus, sent to the Thracian king Polymnestor for safekeeping.[^met-hec-penelope]

### Polydorus and Revenge (13.535-564)

Going to the shore to draw water, Hecuba found the body of Polydorus, "killed, disfigured with deep wounds of Thracian swords." Polymnestor had murdered his ward for gold. "She was struck dumb with her agony, which quite consumed both voice and tears within her heart — rigid and still she seemed as a hard rock."[^met-hec-polydorus]

Then "she arms herself and draws up all her wrath. It burned as if she still held regal power." Like "a lioness rages when plundered of her suckling cub," she lured Polymnestor with a false promise of hidden gold. When he came, "she flew at him and drove her fingers deep in his perfidious eyes; and tore them from his face — and plunged her hands into the raw and bleeding sockets (passion made her strong)."[^met-hec-revenge]

### Transformation (13.565-575)

The Thracians attacked her with stones and darts, "but she with hoarse growling and snapping jaws sprang at the stones, and, when she tried to speak, she barked like a fierce dog. The place still bears a name suggested by her hideous change." She ran "howling dismally in Thracian fields."[^met-hec-dog]

"Her sad fate moved the Trojans and the Greeks, her friends and foes, and all the heavenly gods. Yes all, for even the sister-wife of Jove denied that Hecuba deserved such fate."[^met-hec-pity]

[^met-hec-fall]: "Jove's altar drank old Priam's scanty blood. The priestess of Apollo then, alas! Was dragged by her long hair... Astyanax was hurled down from the very tower from which he often had looked forth and seen his father, by his mother pointed out, when Hector fought for honor and his country's weal" (Metamorphoses 13.404-420, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-hec-polyxena]: "Do not delay my generous gift of blood, with no resistance thrust the ready steel into my throat or breast!... Polyxena would never wish to live in slavery" (Metamorphoses 13.457-473, trans. Brookes More)

Brookes More)
[^met-hec-penelope]: "serving Penelope: who showing me to curious dames of Ithaca, will point and say, while I am bending to my task, 'Look at that woman who was widely known, the mother of great Hector, once the wife of Priam!'" (Metamorphoses 13.513-518, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-hec-polydorus]: "she saw the corpse of her last son, thrown out upon the shore; her Polydorus, killed, disfigured with deep wounds of Thracian swords... she was struck dumb with her agony, which quite consumed both voice and tears within her heart — rigid and still she seemed as a hard rock" (Metamorphoses 13.535-542, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-hec-revenge]: "she flew at him and drove her fingers deep in his perfidious eyes; and tore them from his face — and plunged her hands into the raw and bleeding sockets (passion made her strong)" (Metamorphoses 13.560-566, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-hec-dog]: "she with hoarse growling and snapping jaws sprang at the stones, and, when she tried to speak, she barked like a fierce dog. The place still bears a name suggested by her hideous change" (Metamorphoses 13.569-572, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-hec-pity]: "Her sad fate moved the Trojans and the Greeks, her friends and foes, and all the heavenly gods. Yes all, for even the sister-wife of Jove denied that Hecuba deserved such fate" (Metamorphoses 13.573-575, trans. Brookes More)

## In Euripides' Hecuba

The [Hecuba](../sources/euripides-hecuba.md) dramatizes two linked tragedies after Troy's fall, with Hecuba as the central figure.

### The Sacrifice of Polyxena

[Achilles](achilles.md)' ghost appears above his tomb and demands Polyxena as a sacrifice: "having ascended o'er his tomb, he appeared in his golden arms and restrained the fleet ships... exclaiming... 'Where speed ye, Grecians, leaving my tomb unhonored!'"[^eur-hec-ghost] [Odysseus](odysseus.md) persuades the army to comply. Hecuba confronts Odysseus, reminding him of the time she saved his life when he came as a spy to Troy — an appeal to xenia. Odysseus acknowledges the debt but insists on honoring Achilles.

Polyxena refuses to beg for her life, declaring: "I die willingly; let none touch my body; for I will offer my neck to the sword with a good heart. But, by the Gods, let me go free while ye kill me, that I may die free, for to be classed as a slave among the dead, when a queen, is what I am ashamed of."[^eur-hec-free] At the altar, she bares her breast and speaks: "Lo! strike, if this bosom thou desirest, O youth; or wouldest thou rather under the neck, here is this throat prepared."[^eur-hec-strike] Even in death, "she showed much care to fall decently, and to veil from the eyes of men what ought to be concealed."[^eur-hec-modesty-eur]

### Murder of Polydorus and Revenge

Hecuba's attendant finds Polydorus's body washed up on shore — murdered by Polymestor, the Thracian king to whom Priam entrusted his youngest son with gold. Hecuba cries: "Where are the laws of hospitality? O most accurst of men!"[^eur-hec-xenia]

She appeals to [Agamemnon](agamemnon.md) for justice, arguing that "the Gods are strong, and strong the law, which governs them; for by the law we judge that there are Gods, and we live having justice and injustice strictly defined."[^eur-hec-law] Hecuba also reflects on universal bondage: "no mortal is there who is free. For either he is the slave of money or of fortune; or the populace of the city or the dictates of the law constrain him to adopt manners not accordant with his natural inclinations."[^eur-hec-slave]

With Agamemnon's tacit approval, Hecuba lures Polymestor into the captive women's tent. The Trojan women kill his sons with hidden daggers and gouge out his eyes with their brooches.

### Polymestor's Prophecies

The blinded Polymestor prophesies Hecuba's transformation: "Thou shalt become a dog with a fiery aspect... The tomb of the wretched dog, a mark to mariners."[^eur-hec-dog-prophecy] He also foretells Cassandra's death and Agamemnon's murder: "the murderous bath at Argos awaits thee."[^eur-hec-agamemnon] Agamemnon has him dragged away.

[^eur-hec-ghost]: "having ascended o'er his tomb, he appeared in his golden arms and restrained the fleet ships... exclaiming... 'Where speed ye, Grecians, leaving my tomb unhonored!'" (Hecuba 110-115, trans. T.A. Buckley)
[^eur-hec-free]: "I die willingly; let none touch my body; for I will offer my neck to the sword with a good heart. But, by the Gods, let me go free while ye kill me, that I may die free, for to be classed as a slave among the dead, when a queen, is what I am ashamed of" (Hecuba 548-552, trans. T.A. Buckley)
[^eur-hec-strike]: "Lo! strike, if this bosom thou desirest, O youth; or wouldest thou rather under the neck, here is this throat prepared" (Hecuba 563-565, trans. T.A. Buckley)
[^eur-hec-modesty-eur]: "she showed much care to fall decently, and to veil from the eyes of men what ought to be concealed" (Hecuba 569-570, trans. T.A. Buckley)
[^eur-hec-xenia]: "Where are the laws of hospitality? O most accurst of men, how didst thou mar that skin, how sever with the cruel sword the poor limbs of this boy, nor didst feel pity?" (Hecuba 714-720, trans. T.A. Buckley)
[^eur-hec-law]: "the Gods are strong, and strong the law, which governs them; for by the law we judge that there are Gods, and we live having justice and injustice strictly defined" (Hecuba 799-801, trans. T.A. Buckley)
[^eur-hec-slave]: "no mortal is there who is free. For either he is the slave of money or of fortune; or the populace of the city or the dictates of the law constrain him to adopt manners not accordant with his natural inclinations" (Hecuba 864-867, trans. T.A. Buckley)
[^eur-hec-dog-prophecy]: "Thou shalt become a dog with a fiery aspect... The tomb of the wretched dog, a mark to mariners" (Hecuba 1265-1273, trans. T.A. Buckley)
[^eur-hec-agamemnon]: "the murderous bath at Argos awaits thee" (Hecuba 1279, trans. T.A. Buckley)

## In the [Posthomerica](../sources/posthomerica.md)

### Enslavement (Book XIV)

After the sack of Troy, [Odysseus](odysseus.md) "dragged" Hecuba to his ship. "The tears poured from her eyes as water from a spring; trembled her limbs, fear-frenzied was her heart; rent were her hoary tresses and besprent with ashes of the hearth, cast by her hands when she saw [Priam](priam.md) slain and Troy aflame."[^post-hec-slave]

### Lament at Polyxena's Sacrifice (Book XIV)

When [Achilles](achilles.md)' ghost demanded the sacrifice of Polyxena, "yet sharper pain fell on the heart of hapless Hecuba." She recalled an ominous dream: "Herseemed that on Achilles' tomb she stood moaning, her hair down-streaming to the ground, and from her breasts blood dripped to earth the while." She wailed: "Ah me! what sorrows first or last shall I lament heart-anguished, who am full of woes?... a dead man's heart, Achilles' heart, is by our blood made warm with life to-day! O child, dear child, that I might die with thee."[^post-hec-polyxena]

### Transformation to Stone (Book XIV)

As the Greeks prepared to depart, "all-unhappy Priam's queen was changed from woman's form into a pitiful hound; and all men gathered round in wondering awe. Then all her body a God transformed to stone — a mighty marvel for men yet unborn!" At [Calchas](calchas.md)' bidding, the Greeks carried the stone across to the far side of the Hellespont.[^post-hec-stone]

[^post-hec-slave]: "Hecuba Odysseus dragged unto his ship. The tears poured from her eyes as water from a spring; trembled her limbs, fear-frenzied was her heart; rent were her hoary tresses and besprent with ashes of the hearth" (Posthomerica 14.10059-10064, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post-hec-polyxena]: "Herseemed that on Achilles' tomb she stood moaning, her hair down-streaming to the ground, and from her breasts blood dripped to earth... Ah me! what sorrows first or last shall I lament heart-anguished, who am full of woes?... a dead man's heart, Achilles' heart, is by our blood made warm with life to-day!" (Posthomerica 14.10347-10377)
[^post-hec-stone]: "all-unhappy Priam's queen was changed from woman's form into a pitiful hound; and all men gathered round in wondering awe. Then all her body a God transformed to stone — a mighty marvel for men yet unborn!" (Posthomerica 14.10428-10432)

## Variant Traditions

All three sources agree on Hecuba's transformation into a dog, but differ in the details:

- In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md), Hecuba is transformed while still alive, as a consequence of her frenzy after blinding Polymestor — she snaps and growls at Thracians throwing stones, and when she tries to speak she barks.
- In Euripides' [Hecuba](../sources/euripides-hecuba.md), the transformation is only prophesied by the blinded Polymestor: she will become "a dog with a fiery aspect" and her tomb "a mark to mariners."
- In the [Posthomerica](../sources/posthomerica.md), the transformation happens in two stages — first into a "pitiful hound," then a god turns her entire body to stone — and the petrified form is carried across the Hellespont.
