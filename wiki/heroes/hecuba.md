## Overview

**Hecuba** is the wife of Priam and queen of [Troy](../places/troy.md). In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md), her story after Troy's fall is one of Ovid's most sustained portraits of grief — the loss of her children one by one, culminating in savage revenge and transformation into a howling dog.

## In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md)

### The Fall of Troy (13.404-428)

After Troy falls, Hecuba witnesses the worst: "Jove's altar drank old Priam's scanty blood." Cassandra, "the priestess of [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md)," is "dragged by her long hair, while up towards heaven she lifted supplicating hands in vain." The Trojan women are carried off as spoil, and Astyanax is "hurled down from the very tower from which he often had looked forth and seen his father, by his mother pointed out, when Hector fought for honor and his country's weal."[^met-hec-fall]

### Polyxena's Sacrifice (13.440-480)

[Achilles](achilles.md)' ghost rose from the earth on the Thracian shore, "as large as when he lived," and demanded the sacrifice of Polyxena. The girl was "torn from her mother's bosom" and led to the altar, where she showed extraordinary courage: "Do not delay my generous gift of blood, with no resistance thrust the ready steel into my throat or breast! Polyxena would never wish to live in slavery."[^met-hec-polyxena]

She asked only that her body be returned to her mother: "King Priam's daughter, not a captive, pleads — freely return my body to my mother, let her not pay with gold for the sad right to bury me — but only with her tears!" Even the priest wept as he drove the steel into her breast, but "no one saw her shed one tear." Dying, "it was her care to cover all that ought to be concealed, and save the value of chaste modesty."[^met-hec-modesty]

### Hecuba's Lament (13.481-535)

[Odysseus](odysseus.md) claimed Hecuba as his prize "only because she had brought Hector forth." She embraced Polyxena's body and "bathed her daughter's wounds with tears and kissed them with her lips." Her lament catalogues her losses: "But lately on the pinnacle of fame, surrounded by my powerful sons-in-law, daughters, and daughters-in-law, and strong in my great husband, I am exiled now, and destitute, and forced from the sad tombs of those I love, to wretched slavery."[^met-hec-lament]

She imagined serving Penelope on Ithaca: "Look at that woman who was widely known, the mother of great Hector, once the wife of Priam!" Yet she clung to one hope — her youngest son Polydorus, sent to the Thracian king Polymnestor for safekeeping.[^met-hec-penelope]

### Polydorus and Revenge (13.535-564)

Going to the shore to draw water, Hecuba found the body of Polydorus, "killed, disfigured with deep wounds of Thracian swords." Polymnestor had murdered his ward for gold. "She was struck dumb with her agony, which quite consumed both voice and tears within her heart — rigid and still she seemed as a hard rock."[^met-hec-polydorus]

Then "she arms herself and draws up all her wrath. It burned as if she still held regal power." Like "a lioness rages when plundered of her suckling cub," she lured Polymnestor with a false promise of hidden gold. When he came, "she flew at him and drove her fingers deep in his perfidious eyes; and tore them from his face — and plunged her hands into the raw and bleeding sockets (passion made her strong)."[^met-hec-revenge]

### Transformation (13.565-575)

The Thracians attacked her with stones and darts, "but she with hoarse growling and snapping jaws sprang at the stones, and, when she tried to speak, she barked like a fierce dog. The place still bears a name suggested by her hideous change." She ran "howling dismally in Thracian fields."[^met-hec-dog]

"Her sad fate moved the Trojans and the Greeks, her friends and foes, and all the heavenly gods. Yes all, for even the sister-wife of Jove denied that Hecuba deserved such fate."[^met-hec-pity]
