## Overview

**Argus Panoptes** — literally "Argus the All-seeing" — was a monstrously powerful creature with eyes covering his entire body. Sent by [Hera](../deities/hera.md) to guard the transformed [Io](io.md), he became famous as her perpetual watcher. He performed many heroic deeds, slaying dangerous creatures that threatened mortals, making him a guardian figure despite his monstrous nature.

## In the Bibliotheca

Argus is introduced as the descendant of a royal line: "Ecbasus had a son Agenor, and Agenor had a son Argus, the one who is called the All-seeing. He had eyes in the whole of his body, and being exceedingly strong he killed the bull that ravaged Arcadia and clad himself in its hide; and when a satyr wronged the Arcadians and robbed them of their cattle, Argus withstood and killed him."[^apd-strength]

Beyond these feats, "It is said, too, that Echidna, daughter of Tartarus and Earth, who used to carry off passers-by, was caught asleep and slain by Argus. He also avenged the murder of Apis by putting the guilty to death."[^apd-avenging]

His most famous role was assigned by [Hera](../deities/hera.md): to guard the heifer [Io](io.md), whom [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) had transformed to conceal his affair. Though the sources do not detail his death in the Bibliotheca, later tradition tells of his being lulled to sleep and slain by [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md) on [Hera](../deities/hera.md)'s behalf.
