## Overview

**Pyramus** was a Babylonian youth, "most handsome of all youthful men," who loved Thisbe, "loveliest of all eastern girls." Their tragic love story, told in Ovid's [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md) Book IV, explains the origin of the mulberry's dark fruit.

### The Forbidden Love (4.55-80)

Pyramus and Thisbe "lived in adjoining houses, near the walls that Queen Semiramis had built of brick around her famous city." They grew to love each other, but "that joy their fathers had forbidden them to hope."[^met-pyramus-love] Unable to meet openly, they discovered a crack in the shared wall and "used its passage to convey the sounds of gentle, murmured words."[^met-pyramus-wall] They would stand on either side: "Thou envious wall why art thou standing in the way of those who die for love?"[^met-pyramus-sigh]

### The Tryst at the Tomb of Ninus (4.81-104)

They resolved to steal away at night and meet beneath "a tall mulberry tree, covered with snow-white fruit, close by a spring" at the tomb of Ninus.[^met-pyramus-tryst] Thisbe arrived first, but fled when a lioness approached the spring, "her frothing jaws incarnadined with blood of slaughtered oxen." In her flight Thisbe dropped her veil, which the lioness "tore and stained with her bloody jaws."[^met-pyramus-lion]

### Pyramus's Death (4.105-127)

When Pyramus arrived and found the bloodied veil, he cried: "Alas, one night has caused the ruin of two lovers! Thou wert most deserving of completed days, but as for me, my heart is guilty! I destroyed thee!"[^met-pyramus-lament] He drove his sword into his side, and "his spurting blood shot upward in the air; so, when decay has rift a leaden pipe a hissing jet of water spurts on high." The mulberry roots soaked up the blood and "the pendent mulberries were dyed a purple tint."[^met-pyramus-death]

### Thisbe's Death (4.128-166)

Thisbe returned and found Pyramus dying. She "bathed the wound with tears, mingling her grief in his unquenched blood" and cried: "Pyramus! Pyramus! awake! It is thy dearest Thisbe calls thee!"[^met-pyramus-thisbe] At her name "he raised his eyes, though languorous in death, and darkness gathered round him as he gazed." Thisbe then fell upon his sword herself, praying that the tree "mourn our untimely deaths; let thy fruit darken for a memory, an emblem of our blood."[^met-pyramus-prayer] The gods answered her prayer: "Now the Gods have changed the ripened fruit which darkens on the branch: and from the funeral pile their parents sealed their gathered ashes in a single urn."[^met-pyramus-end]

[^met-pyramus-love]: "When Pyramus and Thisbe, who were known the one most handsome of all youthful men, the other loveliest of all eastern girls,—lived in adjoining houses, near the walls that Queen Semiramis had built of brick around her famous city, they grew fond, and loved each other" (Metamorphoses 4.55-62, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-pyramus-wall]: "a partition built between their houses, many years ago, was made defective with a little chink... Our lovers found the secret opening, and used its passage to convey the sounds of gentle, murmured words" (Metamorphoses 4.65-72, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-pyramus-sigh]: "Thou envious wall why art thou standing in the way of those who die for love?" (Metamorphoses 4.73-75, trans. Brookes More)

[^met-pyramus-lion]: "a great lioness approached the nearby spring to quench her thirst: her frothing jaws incarnadined with blood of slaughtered oxen" (Metamorphoses 4.96-98, trans. Brookes More)

[^met-pyramus-death]: "his spurting blood shot upward in the air; so, when decay has rift a leaden pipe a hissing jet of water spurts on high.—By that dark tide the berries on the tree assumed a deeper tint, for as the roots soaked up the blood the pendent mulberries were dyed a purple tint" (Metamorphoses 4.121-127, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-pyramus-thisbe]: "she bathed the wound with tears, mingling her grief in his unquenched blood; and as she kissed his death-cold features wailed; 'Ah Pyramus, what cruel fate has taken thy life away? Pyramus! Pyramus! awake! awake! It is thy dearest Thisbe calls thee!'" (Metamorphoses 4.140-147, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-pyramus-prayer]: "let thy fruit darken for a memory, an emblem of our blood" (Metamorphoses 4.159-160, trans. Brookes More)
