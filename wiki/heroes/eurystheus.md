## Overview

**Eurystheus** was king of Mycenae who imposed the Twelve Labours on [Heracles](heracles.md) and, after Heracles' death, persecuted his children across Greece. His authority over Heracles stemmed from [Hera](../deities/hera.md)'s manipulation: she delayed Heracles' birth and hastened Eurystheus's, so that he was born first and thereby gained lordship.

## In the Iliad

[Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) recounts the story of Eurystheus's birth to illustrate how [Hera](../deities/hera.md) deceived him. Zeus had sworn that the child born that day of his lineage would rule, intending [Heracles](heracles.md); Hera delayed Heracles' birth and hastened Eurystheus's, making him lord over the house of Perseus.[^il19-birth]

[^il19-birth]: Iliad 19.95–133

## In the Bibliotheca

Eurystheus imposed the Twelve Labours on [Heracles](heracles.md) at [Hera](../deities/hera.md)'s instigation. After Heracles' death and apotheosis, the Heraclidae fled Eurystheus to Athens. [Hyllus](hyllus.md) slew Eurystheus, and [Alcmena](alcmena.md) gouged out his eyes.[^apd-heraclids]

[^apd-heraclids]: "the Heraclids fled to Ceyx, and afterwards to Theseus... Hyllus pursued and slew Eurystheus" (Bibliotheca 2.8.1, trans. Frazer)

## In the Fabulae

Hyginus lists Eurystheus as the one who imposed the twelve labours and the incidental labours on [Heracles](heracles.md).[^hyg-labours]

[^hyg-labours]: Fabulae §30

## In Euripides' Heraclidae

### Persecution of the Heraclidae

Eurystheus does not appear onstage until the final scene but drives the entire plot. He sends his herald Copreus to drag [Iolaus](iolaus.md) and [Heracles](heracles.md)' children from the altar at Marathon, threatening war against any city that shelters them. As [Iolaus](iolaus.md) describes it, "Eurystheus has chosen to insult me with this insult; sending heralds whenever on earth he learns we are settled, he demands us, and drives us out of the land."[^eur-hcl-pursuit]

### Cowardice in Battle

When [Hyllus](hyllus.md) challenges him to single combat to decide the war, Eurystheus refuses: "he neither regarding those who had heard the speech, nor, although he was general, his own character for cowardice, ventured not to come near the warlike spear, but was most cowardly."[^eur-hcl-cowardice]

### Capture and Defense

Captured at the Scironian rocks by the rejuvenated [Iolaus](iolaus.md), Eurystheus is brought before [Alcmena](alcmena.md). He offers a frank defense, claiming that [Hera](../deities/hera.md) compelled his actions: "not of my own accord did I undertake this strife — I knew that I was your cousin by birth, and a relation to your son Hercules; but whether I wished it or not, Juno, for it was a Goddess, forced me to toil through this ill."[^eur-hcl-hera]

He acknowledges Heracles' greatness even while calling him an enemy: "though he be mine enemy, yet shall he be well spoken of, as he was a doughty man." He argues that anyone in his position would have acted the same: "You, therefore, had you obtained my fortunes, would not have oppressed with evils the hostile offspring of a hated lion, but would wisely have permitted them to live in Argos; you will persuade no one of this."[^eur-hcl-defense]

### Protective Burial Prophecy

Facing execution, Eurystheus reveals an oracle of [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md): his body, buried before the temple of [Athena](../deities/athena.md) at Pallene, will protect Athens against future invasions by the Heraclidae's descendants: "being well disposed to you, and a protector to the city, I shall ever lie as a sojourner under the ground, but most hostile to their descendants when they come hither with much force, betraying this kindness."[^eur-hcl-prophecy]

He explains he trusted [Hera](../deities/hera.md) over the oracle, which is why he came to Athens despite knowing his fate. [Alcmena](alcmena.md) orders him killed and his body given to the dogs.[^eur-hcl-death]

[^eur-hcl-pursuit]: "Eurystheus has chosen to insult me with this insult; sending heralds whenever on earth he learns we are settled, he demands us, and drives us out of the land" (Heraclidae 36–40, trans. T.A. Buckley)
[^eur-hcl-cowardice]: "he neither regarding those who had heard the speech, nor, although he was general, his own character for cowardice, ventured not to come near the warlike spear, but was most cowardly" (Heraclidae 819–823, trans. T.A. Buckley)
[^eur-hcl-hera]: "not of my own accord did I undertake this strife — I knew that I was your cousin by birth, and a relation to your son Hercules; but whether I wished it or not, Juno, for it was a Goddess, forced me to toil through this ill" (Heraclidae 989–993, trans. T.A. Buckley)
[^eur-hcl-defense]: "though he be mine enemy, yet shall he be well spoken of, as he was a doughty man... You, therefore, had you obtained my fortunes, would not have oppressed with evils the hostile offspring of a hated lion, but would wisely have permitted them to live in Argos; you will persuade no one of this" (Heraclidae 997–1007, trans. T.A. Buckley)
[^eur-hcl-prophecy]: "being well disposed to you, and a protector to the city, I shall ever lie as a sojourner under the ground, but most hostile to their descendants when they come hither with much force, betraying this kindness" (Heraclidae 1032–1037, trans. T.A. Buckley)
[^eur-hcl-death]: "Slay me, I do not deprecate thy wrath. But this city indeed, since it has released me, and feared to slay me, I will present with an ancient oracle of Apollo" (Heraclidae 1026–1029, trans. T.A. Buckley)
