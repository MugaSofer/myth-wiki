## Overview

**Creusa** was a daughter of [Erechtheus](erechtheus.md) king of [Athens](../places/athens.md), the sole survivor of her sisters (who were sacrificed for their country). Raped by [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) in the Macrai cave beneath the Acropolis, she bore a son in secret and exposed him, believing he died. Years later, she came to [Delphi](../places/delphi.md) with her husband Xuthus seeking children, and unknowingly tried to poison her own lost son before the truth was revealed.

## In Euripides' [Ion](../sources/euripides-ion.md)

### The Rape and Exposure

Apollo raped Creusa at the Macrai cave, "where northward points the rock beneath the heights crown'd with the Athenian citadel of Pallas." She bore a son in secret and exposed him in an ark, "observant of the customs drawn from her great progenitors, and chief from Erichthonius." She hung her ornaments on the infant — a cloth woven with a Gorgon, two golden dragons (Athena's gift in the tradition of [Erichthonius](erechtheus.md)), and an olive branch from Athena's tree — and left him to die.[^eur-ion-cr-expose]

### At Delphi

Creusa arrives at Delphi with her husband Xuthus, childless after years of marriage. She weeps at the sight of Apollo's temple, which "awakes the sad remembrance of things past." In conversation with Ion (whom she does not recognise as her son), she tells his story as that of a "friend" who was raped by Apollo and lost her child. When Ion suggests Apollo might be secretly nurturing the child, Creusa responds bitterly: "Unjust to enjoy alone a common right."[^eur-ion-cr-unjust]

### The Revelation

When the Chorus tells Creusa that Xuthus has been given a son (Ion) while she remains childless, she breaks her long silence and publicly accuses Apollo. Her speech is one of the play's great set-pieces: "Thou camest to me, with gold thy locks all glittering, as the vermeil flowers I gather'd in my vest to deck my bosom with the spring's glowing hues; in my white hand thy hand enlocking, to the cavern'd rock thou led'st me; naught avail'd my cries, that call'd my mother; on thou led'st me, wanton god, immodestly, to Venus paying homage."[^eur-ion-cr-accuse] She denounces Apollo to his face at his own oracle: "Nor here, nor there, O Phoebus, art thou just."

### The Gorgon Blood

Creusa reveals a family heirloom passed down from [Erichthonius](erechtheus.md): two drops of blood from the [Gorgon](../creatures/gorgons.md), given by [Athena](../deities/athena.md) — "The one works death, the other heals disease," enclosed in gold. She gives the deadly drop to her Tutor to poison Ion's wine.[^eur-ion-cr-gorgon]

### Recognition

After the plot is discovered and Creusa is condemned to death, she takes refuge at Apollo's altar. When the Priestess brings forth the infant ark, Creusa recognises it and proves her maternity by naming the tokens inside without seeing them. Reunited with Ion, she swears by Athena that Apollo is his true father. [Athena](../deities/athena.md) confirms this and prophesies that Creusa and Xuthus will also have a son, Dorus (ancestor of the Dorians).[^eur-ion-cr-reconcile]

Creusa's final words reconcile her to the god who wronged her: "Phoebus I praise, before unpraised; my son he now restores, of whom till now I deem'd him heedless. Now these gates are beauteous to mine eyes; his oracles now grateful to my soul, unpleasant late."[^eur-ion-cr-praise]
