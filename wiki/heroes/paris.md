## Overview

**Paris** (also called Alexandros) was a prince of [Troy](../places/troy.md), the second son of [Priam](priam.md) and [Hecuba](hecuba.md). His judgment between three goddesses — awarding the prize of beauty to [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md) in exchange for the hand of [Helen](helen.md) — set in motion the Trojan War. He is characterised throughout the sources as beautiful but flawed: a skilled archer but a reluctant fighter, alternately scorned by his brother [Hector](hector.md) and protected by Aphrodite.

## Epithets

- **"godlike Alexandros"** — the standard Homeric epithet, used throughout the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md)[^il3-godlike]
- **"Ill Paris, most fair in semblance"** — [Hector](hector.md)'s scornful address, combining acknowledgment of his beauty with contempt for his cowardice[^il3-ill]

[^il3-godlike]: "godlike Alexandros marked him appear amid the champions" (Iliad III.1656, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il3-ill]: "Ill Paris, most fair in semblance, thou deceiver woman-mad" (Iliad III.1663)

## Appearance

Paris's beauty is his defining physical trait, repeatedly noted by friends and enemies alike. When [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md) rescues him from the duel with [Menelaus](menelaus.md), she sets him in his chamber where he appears "radiant in beauty and vesture; nor wouldst thou deem him to be come from fighting his foe, but rather to be faring to the dance, or from the dance to be just resting and set down."[^il3-radiant]

[Hector](hector.md) openly mocks his beauty as useless: "a prince is our champion only because a goodly favour is his; but in his heart is there no strength nor any courage... Thy lyre will not avail thee nor the gifts of [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md), those thy locks and fair favour, when thou grovellest in the dust."[^il3-favour]

When he first appears on the battlefield, he wears distinctive equipment: "upon his shoulders panther-skin and curved bow and sword; and he brandished two bronze-headed spears."[^il3-panther]

[^il3-radiant]: "There is he in his chamber and inlaid bed, radiant in beauty and vesture; nor wouldst thou deem him to be come from fighting his foe, but rather to be faring to the dance, or from the dance to be just resting and set down" (Iliad III.1989-1991)
[^il3-favour]: "a prince is our champion only because a goodly favour is his; but in his heart is there no strength nor any courage... Thy lyre will not avail thee nor the gifts of Aphrodite, those thy locks and fair favour, when thou grovellest in the dust" (Iliad III.1667-1678)
[^il3-panther]: "godlike Alexandros played champion to the Trojans, wearing upon his shoulders panther-skin and curved bow and sword; and he brandished two bronze-headed spears" (Iliad III.1642-1645)

## In the Iliad

### Duel with Menelaus (Book III)

Paris stepped forward to champion the Trojans, but when [Menelaus](menelaus.md) saw him — "even as a lion is glad when he lighteth upon a great carcase" — Paris's courage failed. "Even as a man that hath seen a serpent in a mountain glade starteth backward and trembling seizeth his feet beneath him... even so did godlike Alexandros for fear of Atreus' son shrink back into the throng."[^il3-fear]

After [Hector](hector.md)'s rebuke, Paris agreed to a formal duel for Helen and all her wealth. He armed in "the corslet of his brother Lykaon" and fought Menelaus in single combat. He lost decisively — his spear failed to pierce Menelaus's shield, while Menelaus's spear drove through Paris's shield and corslet. When Menelaus dragged him by the helmet-crest, [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md) intervened: she "snatched up Paris, very easily as a goddess may, and hid him in thick darkness, and sent him down in his fragrant perfumed chamber."[^il3-rescue]

Paris's response to Helen's reproach is characteristic: "Chide not my soul, lady, with cruel taunts... But come now, let us have joy of love upon our couch; for never yet hath love so enwrapped my heart... as I love thee now and sweet desire taketh hold upon me."[^il3-desire]

[^il3-fear]: "even as a man that hath seen a serpent in a mountain glade starteth backward and trembling seizeth his feet beneath him, and he retreateth back again, and paleness hath hold of his cheeks, even so did godlike Alexandros for fear of Atreus' son shrink back into the throng of lordly Trojans" (Iliad III.1658-1662)
[^il3-rescue]: "Aphrodite snatched up Paris, very easily as a goddess may, and hid him in thick darkness, and sent him down in his fragrant perfumed chamber" (Iliad III.1980-1982)
[^il3-desire]: "Chide not my soul, lady, with cruel taunts... But come now, let us have joy of love upon our couch; for never yet hath love so enwrapped my heart — not even then when first I snatched thee from lovely Lakedaimon and sailed with thee on my seafaring ships, and in the isle of Kranaë had converse with thee upon thy couch in love — as I love thee now and sweet desire taketh hold upon me" (Iliad III.2034-2041)

### The Gifts of Aphrodite

Paris defends the gifts he has received from [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md) against [Hector](hector.md)'s contempt: "Cast not in my teeth the lovely gifts of golden Aphrodite; not to be flung aside are the gods' glorious gifts that of their own good will they give; for by his desire can no man win them."[^il3-gifts]

[^il3-gifts]: "Cast not in my teeth the lovely gifts of golden Aphrodite; not to be flung aside are the gods' glorious gifts that of their own good will they give; for by his desire can no man win them" (Iliad III.1690-1692)

### Wounding Diomedes (Book XI)

Paris wounded [Diomedes](diomedes.md) with an arrow from behind cover: "Paris smote behind the lower part of the right foot" as Diomedes stood over a fallen enemy, pinning his foot to the ground.[^il11-diomedes]

[^il11-diomedes]: "Paris smote behind the lower part of the right foot" (Iliad XI.9041)

## In the Bibliotheca

### Birth and Exposure (3.12.5)

Before Paris was born, [Hecuba](hecuba.md) "dreamed she had brought forth a firebrand, and that the fire spread over the whole city and burned it." The dream was interpreted by Aesacus as meaning the child "was begotten to be the ruin of his country." [Priam](priam.md) ordered the infant exposed on Mount Ida, but "the infant was nursed for five days by a bear; and, when he found it safe, he took it up, carried it away, brought it up as his own son on his farm, and named him Paris."[^apd-birth]

"When he grew to be a young man, Paris excelled many in beauty and strength, and was afterwards surnamed Alexander, because he repelled robbers and defended the flocks."[^apd-alexander]

[^apd-birth]: "Hecuba dreamed she had brought forth a firebrand, and that the fire spread over the whole city and burned it... He declared that the child was begotten to be the ruin of his country and advised that the babe should be exposed... the infant was nursed for five days by a bear" (Bibliotheca 3.12.5, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-alexander]: "When he grew to be a young man, Paris excelled many in beauty and strength, and was afterwards surnamed Alexander, because he repelled robbers and defended the flocks" (Bibliotheca 3.12.5, trans. J.G. Frazer)

### Marriage to Oenone (3.12.6)

Paris's first wife was Oenone, a nymph daughter of the river Cebren. "She had learned from Rhea the art of prophecy, and warned Alexander not to sail to fetch [Helen](helen.md)." When Paris was later mortally wounded by Philoctetes' arrow, "he went back to Oenone on Ida. But she, nursing her grievance, refused to heal him. So Alexander was carried to [Troy](../places/troy.md) and died. But Oenone repented her, and brought the healing drugs; and finding him dead she hanged herself."[^apd-oenone]

[^apd-oenone]: "Alexander married Oenone, daughter of the river Cebren. She had learned from Rhea the art of prophecy, and warned Alexander not to sail to fetch Helen; but failing to persuade him, she told him to come to her if he were wounded, for she alone could heal him... she, nursing her grievance, refused to heal him. So Alexander was carried to Troy and died. But Oenone repented her, and brought the healing drugs; and finding him dead she hanged herself" (Bibliotheca 3.12.6, trans. J.G. Frazer)

### The Judgment (E.3.2)

[Strife](../deities/night.md) "threw an apple as a prize of beauty to be contended for by [Hera](../deities/hera.md), [Athena](../deities/athena.md), and [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md); and [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) commanded [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md) to lead them to Alexander on Ida in order to be judged by him." Each goddess offered a bribe: "Hera said that if she were preferred to all women, she would give him the kingdom over all men; and Athena promised victory in war, and Aphrodite the hand of Helen. And he decided in favour of Aphrodite."[^apd-judgment]

[^apd-judgment]: "Strife threw an apple as a prize of beauty to be contended for by Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite; and Zeus commanded Hermes to lead them to Alexander on Ida in order to be judged by him. And they promised to give Alexander gifts. Hera said that if she were preferred to all women, she would give him the kingdom over all men; and Athena promised victory in war, and Aphrodite the hand of Helen. And he decided in favour of Aphrodite" (Bibliotheca E.3.2, trans. J.G. Frazer)

### Abduction of Helen (E.3.3-4)

Paris sailed to Sparta, where he was entertained by [Menelaus](menelaus.md) for nine days. On the tenth day, "Menelaus having gone on a journey to Crete... Alexander persuaded [Helen](helen.md) to go off with him. And she abandoned Hermione, then nine years old, and putting most of the property on board, she set sail with him by night."[^apd-abduction]

[^apd-abduction]: "Menelaus having gone on a journey to Crete to perform the obsequies of his mother's father Catreus, Alexander persuaded Helen to go off with him. And she abandoned Hermione, then nine years old, and putting most of the property on board, she set sail with him by night" (Bibliotheca E.3.3, trans. J.G. Frazer)

### The Duel and Death (E.4.1, E.5.8)

"Alexander fought a single combat with [Menelaus](menelaus.md); and when Alexander got the worst of it, [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md) carried him off."[^apd-duel]

Paris killed [Achilles](achilles.md): he "was shot with an arrow in the ankle by Alexander and [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) at the Scaean gate."[^apd-achilles] Paris himself was later killed by Philoctetes with the bow of [Heracles](heracles.md), and after his death "[Helenus](../sources/apollodorus.md) and Deiphobus quarrelled as to which of them should marry [Helen](helen.md)."[^apd-death]
