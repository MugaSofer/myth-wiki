## Overview

**Aegisthus** was the son of [Thyestes](thyestes.md) and seducer of [Clytemnestra](clytemnestra.md), with whom he conspired to murder [Agamemnon](agamemnon.md) upon the king's return from [Troy](../places/troy.md). He then ruled [Argos](../places/argos.md) until [Orestes](orestes.md) returned and slew him. His story is bound up with the curse on the house of Atreus: his father Thyestes was tricked into eating his own children by [Atreus](../heroes/atreus.md), and Aegisthus's vengeance on Atreus's son Agamemnon was driven by that ancient wrong.

## In the Odyssey

Aegisthus is one of the first figures mentioned in the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md). [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) opens the poem by citing him as an example of mortals who bring suffering upon themselves through their own folly, ignoring the gods' warnings: [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md) was sent to warn Aegisthus not to slay Agamemnon or woo Clytemnestra, "but Aegisthus would in no wise hearken."[^od-zeus]

[Nestor](nestor.md) tells [Telemachus](telemachus.md) that Aegisthus "set a watchman" to spy for Agamemnon's return, then "straightway contrived a guileful thing" and "slew him at the feast, as one slays an ox at the stall." He ruled for seven years before Orestes came from Athens and killed him.[^od-nestor]

In the Underworld, Agamemnon's ghost describes the murder: Aegisthus "bade me to his house, and feasting me, slew me."[^od-ghost]

## In the Bibliotheca

[Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) gives Aegisthus's origins in full: Thyestes, following an oracle, fathered him upon his own daughter Pelopia. The infant was exposed but rescued and nursed by a goat (hence the name Aegisthus, from *aix*, "goat"). Raised by Atreus as his own, Aegisthus later learned his true parentage and killed Atreus, allowing Thyestes to reclaim the throne.[^apd-birth]

After Agamemnon's return from Troy, Aegisthus and Clytemnestra murdered him: "she gave him a shirt without sleeves and without a neck, and while he was putting it on he was cut down."[^apd-murder]

## In the Fabulae

[Hyginus](../sources/hyginus.md) records that Clytemnestra and Aegisthus "killed him with an axe as he was sacrificing, and Cassandra, too." The children Electra and Orestes escaped.[^hyg-murder]

## In Aeschylus' Agamemnon

Aegisthus appears late in the *[Agamemnon](../sources/aeschylus-agamemnon.md)*, entering after the murder to gloat. He tells his own version of the Thyestes story: [Atreus](../heroes/atreus.md) "feigned to hold in loyal joy a day of festal cheer" and set before Thyestes "flesh that was his children once." When Thyestes discovered what he had eaten, "with horror's bitter cry back-starting, spewing forth the fragments foul, on Pelops' house a deadly curse he spake."[^ag-feast]

Aegisthus claims the murder as rightful vengeance: "I, who else? this murder wove and planned." He was the youngest of Thyestes' three surviving children, exiled as an infant.[^ag-claim] When the Chorus derides him as a coward who let a woman do the killing—"Thou womanish man, waiting till war did cease, / Home-watcher and defiler of the couch"—he threatens to rule by force and famine.[^ag-coward] The play ends with Clytemnestra restraining both Aegisthus and the Chorus from further violence: "I and thou will rule the palace and will order all things well."[^ag-rule]

## In Aeschylus' Libation-Bearers

In the *[Libation-Bearers](../sources/aeschylus-libation-bearers.md)*, Aegisthus is summoned to meet the disguised [Orestes](orestes.md). The Chorus conspires with the Nurse Kilissa to ensure he comes without a bodyguard. He enters the palace and is killed offstage—his death-cry is heard: "Help, help, alas!"[^lb-death] A slave announces: "Aegisthus gone!"

## In Sophocles' Electra

In [Sophocles](../sources/sophocles-electra.md)' tragedy, Aegisthus is almost entirely offstage. [Electra](electra.md) describes his usurpation in detail: he sits on [Agamemnon](agamemnon.md)'s throne, wears his robes, and shares [Clytemnestra](clytemnestra.md)'s bed. He plans to entomb Electra in a rock-hewn chamber if she continues mourning.

When the false report of [Orestes](orestes.md)'s death arrives, Aegisthus is absent from the city. He returns near the play's end, expecting to view the corpse. Instead, he finds Clytemnestra's body under a veil and realizes the deception. Orestes forces him to the spot where Agamemnon was murdered and takes him inside to die there. His final words are: "Is there no help but this abode must see the past and future ills of Pelops' race?"[^soph-el-pelops]

## In Euripides' Electra

In Euripides' [Electra](../sources/euripides-electra.md), Aegisthus is killed during a sacrifice to the Nymphs. He invites the disguised [Orestes](orestes.md) — posing as a Thessalian traveller — to share the feast. While examining the bull's entrails, he finds ominous signs: "No lobe was there; but lo, strange caves of gall, and, darkly raised, the portal vein boded to him that gazed fell visitations."[^eur-el-aeg-omens] Orestes strikes from behind with a cleaver, severing spine and brain.

[Electra](electra.md) delivers a long speech over his corpse, mocking his vanity, his subordination to [Clytemnestra](clytemnestra.md) ("on thy ways thou heardst men whispering, 'Lo, the Queen's husband yonder' — not 'the King'"), and his constant fear of Orestes.[^eur-el-aeg-speech]
