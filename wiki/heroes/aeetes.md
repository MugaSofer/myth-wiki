## Overview

**Aeetes** is the king of [Colchis](../places/colchis.md) and keeper of the Golden Fleece. He is a son of [Helius](../deities/helius.md) the sun-god and Perseis, and brother of [Circe](../deities/circe.md) and Pasiphae. His palace at Aea contained miraculous works of [Hephaestus](../deities/hephaestus.md), and his rule over Colchis was absolute and fearful. He is the central antagonist of the Argonautica.

### The Palace of Aea

When [Jason](../heroes/jason.md) and his comrades arrived at Aea under cover of [Hera](../deities/hera.md)'s mist, they marvelled at Aeetes' palace — its courts, wide gates, and columns rising in ordered lines, with a coping of stone resting on brazen triglyphs. Beneath garden vines in full bloom ran four ever-flowing fountains, the work of [Hephaestus](../deities/hephaestus.md): "One was gushing with milk, one with wine, while the third flowed with fragrant oil; and the fourth ran with water, which grew warm at the setting of the Pleiads, and in turn at their rising bubbled forth from the hollow rock, cold as crystal."[^arg3-fountains]

Hephaestus had also fashioned for Aeetes bronze-footed bulls that breathed fire, and a plough of unbending adamant — all wrought "in payment of thanks to Helios, who had taken the god up in his chariot when faint from the Phlegraean fight."[^arg3-bulls]

[^arg3-fountains]: "One was gushing with milk, one with wine, while the third flowed with fragrant oil; and the fourth ran with water, which grew warm at the setting of the Pleiads, and in turn at their rising bubbled forth from the hollow rock, cold as crystal" (Argonautica 3.224-227, trans. R.C. Seaton)
[^arg3-bulls]: "he wrought for him bulls with feet of bronze, and their mouths were of bronze, and from them they breathed out a terrible flame of fire; moreover he forged a plough of unbending adamant, all in one piece, in payment of thanks to Helios, who had taken the god up in his chariot when faint from the Phlegraean fight" (Argonautica 3.230-234)

### Family

The palace was arranged so that Aeetes dwelt in the loftiest building with his queen Eidyia. His son Apsyrtus lived in a separate building; he had been born before Aeetes' marriage, to "a Caucasian nymph, Asterodeia," and the sons of the Colchians called him by the additional name Phaethon, "because he outshone all the youths."[^arg3-apsyrtus] Aeetes' two daughters, Chalciope and [Medea](../heroes/medea.md), occupied the remaining chambers, with Medea spending most of her days at the temple of [Hecate](../deities/hecate.md), where she served as priestess.[^arg3-medea-priest]

[^arg3-apsyrtus]: "in another dwelt Apsyrtus, son of Aeetes, whom a Caucasian nymph, Asterodeia, bare before he made Eidyia his wedded wife, the youngest daughter of Tethys and Oceanus. And the sons of the Colchians called him by the new name of Phaethon, because he outshone all the youths" (Argonautica 3.240-244)
[^arg3-medea-priest]: "all day long was busied in Hecate's temple, since she herself was the priestess of the goddess" (Argonautica 3.249)

### Meeting with Jason

When the sons of Phrixus (Chalciope's sons) arrived back at Aea alongside Jason's crew, Aeetes questioned them with apparent calm, asking after their voyage and the strangers they had brought. Yet on learning that the Argonauts sought the Golden Fleece, "the king at his words was filled with rage as he heard; and his heart was lifted high in wrath."[^arg3-rage] He suspected treachery — that the strangers had come not for the fleece but to seize his throne, and threatened to have their tongues cut out and their hands hewn off.[^arg3-threat]

Jason's careful answer softened him enough to propose a trial: "I will give thee the fleece to bear away, if thou dost wish, when I have tried thee. For against brave men I bear no grudge."[^arg3-trial-offer] The trial was to yoke the two bronze-footed fire-breathing bulls, plough four plough-gates of the field of Ares, sow the dragon's teeth, and slay the armed men that sprang up — all in a single day.[^arg3-task]

[^arg3-rage]: "the king at his words was filled with rage as he heard; and his heart was lifted high in wrath" (Argonautica 3.359-360)
[^arg3-threat]: "Had ye not first tasted of my table, surely would I have cut out your tongues and hewn off both hands and sent you forth with your feet alone" (Argonautica 3.370-372)
[^arg3-trial-offer]: "I will give thee the fleece to bear away, if thou dost wish, when I have tried thee. For against brave men I bear no grudge" (Argonautica 3.398-400)
[^arg3-task]: "Two bulls with feet of bronze I have that pasture on the plain of Ares, breathing forth flame from their jaws; them do I yoke and drive over the stubborn field of Ares, four plough-gates; and quickly cleaving it with the share up to the headland, I cast into the furrows the seed, not the corn of Demeter, but the teeth of a dread serpent that grow up into the fashion of armed men; them I slay at once, cutting them down beneath my spear as they rise against me on all sides" (Argonautica 3.403-410)

### Treachery After the Trial

Although Jason completed the trial with [Medea](../heroes/medea.md)'s secret aid, Aeetes did not honor his word. He assembled the Colchians and planned "to hew down the oak grove above the wooded hill, and burn the ship and her crew" so that they might not escape with the fleece.[^arg3-treachery] He also feared his own children: a prophecy from his father [Helius](../deities/helius.md) had warned him "to avoid the secret treachery and schemes of his own offspring and their crafty mischief."[^arg3-prophecy] Before he could act, Medea brought Jason by night to the grove and lulled the guardian serpent to sleep, and the Argonauts fled.

[^arg3-treachery]: "he would hew down the oak grove above the wooded hill, and burn the ship and her crew, that so they might vent forth in ruin their grievous insolence, for all their haughty schemes" (Argonautica 3.580-583)
[^arg3-prophecy]: "he had heard a baleful prophecy from his father Helios, that he must avoid the secret treachery and schemes of his own offspring and their crafty mischief" (Argonautica 3.595-597)

### The Colchian Pursuit

When the Argonauts fled with the fleece, Aeetes sent the Colchian fleet in pursuit. One division of Colchians, led by Apsyrtus, outstripped the Argonauts by crossing overland and cut off their escape at the Ionian sea. After Jason ambushed and killed Apsyrtus on the sacred island of Artemis in the Brygean isles, the Colchians were thrown into disarray by the death of their prince. [Hera](../deities/hera.md) restrained them further with lightnings, and "at last they loathed their own homes in the Cytaean land, quailing before Aeetes' fierce wrath," and settled scattered in the regions they had sailed to, never returning to Colchis.[^arg4-colchians]

[^arg4-colchians]: "at last they loathed their own homes in the Cytaean land, quailing before Aeetes' fierce wrath; so they landed and made abiding homes there, scattered far and wide" (Argonautica 4.514-515, trans. R.C. Seaton)

### The Mark of Helius

Aeetes' lineage from the sun-god was visible in the faces of his children. When [Circe](../deities/circe.md) saw [Medea](../heroes/medea.md) at her hearth, she recognized her kinship immediately: "all those of the race of Helios were plain to discern, since by the far flashing of their eyes they shot in front of them a gleam as of gold."[^arg4-eyes]

[^arg4-eyes]: "all those of the race of Helios were plain to discern, since by the far flashing of their eyes they shot in front of them a gleam as of gold" (Argonautica 4.725-726)

## In the [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md)

Apollodorus describes Aeetes as "son of the Sun and of Perseis, and brother of Circe and Pasiphae, whom Minos married."[^apd-aeetes] When Phrixus came to Colchis fleeing on the golden ram, Aeetes received him hospitably, gave him his daughter Chalciope in marriage, and accepted the ram's golden fleece as a gift, which he then nailed to an oak in a grove of Ares.[^apd-fleece]

When Jason arrived seeking the fleece, Aeetes set the same trial — yoking the bronze-footed bulls and sowing dragon's teeth — but though Jason completed it with Medea's help, "Aeetes did not give the fleece; for he wished to burn down the Argo and kill the crew."[^apd-treachery] Medea acted first, bringing Jason to the fleece by night. In the Bibliotheca's account, when Aeetes pursued the escaping ship, Medea murdered her brother Apsyrtus and scattered his limbs in the sea; "Gathering the child's limbs, Aeetes fell behind in the pursuit; wherefore he turned back, and, having buried the rescued limbs of his child, he called the place Tomi."[^apd-tomi] He then sent Colchians abroad to search for Medea, threatening punishment if they returned without her.[^apd-colchians]

[^apd-aeetes]: "son of the Sun and of Perseis, and brother of Circe and Pasiphae, whom Minos married" (Bibliotheca 1.9.1, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-fleece]: "the fleece he gave to Aeetes, who nailed it to an oak in a grove of Ares" (Bibliotheca 1.9.1)
[^apd-treachery]: "though the bulls were yoked, Aeetes did not give the fleece; for he wished to burn down the Argo and kill the crew" (Bibliotheca 1.9.23)
[^apd-tomi]: "Gathering the child's limbs, Aeetes fell behind in the pursuit; wherefore he turned back, and, having buried the rescued limbs of his child, he called the place Tomi" (Bibliotheca 1.9.24)
[^apd-colchians]: "he sent out many of the Colchians to search for the Argo, threatening that, if they did not bring Medea to him, they should suffer the punishment due to her" (Bibliotheca 1.9.24)

## Variant Traditions

The two sources differ significantly on the death of Apsyrtus and Aeetes' pursuit. In the Argonautica, Apsyrtus is killed by Jason in a planned ambush at a temple of Artemis; Aeetes himself is not portrayed as personally pursuing the Argonauts, and the Colchian fleet, leaderless after Apsyrtus's death, scatters and settles abroad rather than return to face Aeetes' anger. In the Bibliotheca, Medea murders Apsyrtus and dismembers him, scattering the pieces into the sea; Aeetes personally gives chase, falls behind collecting the limbs, buries them, and names the place Tomi before sending the Colchians abroad to search.
