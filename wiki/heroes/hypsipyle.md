## Overview

**Hypsipyle** is the queen of [Lemnos](../places/lemnos.md) and daughter of Thoas. After [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md) cursed the island's men to reject their wives, the Lemnian women killed all the males on the island — but Hypsipyle alone spared her father, the king, smuggling him away in a chest to drift over the sea. She ruled the island in the aftermath and welcomed the Argonauts when they arrived, hosting [Jason](../heroes/jason.md) in her father's palace.

### The Lemnian Massacre

Before the Argo's arrival, the men of Lemnos had rejected their lawful wives and brought back captive women from raids in Thrace: "for the terrible wrath of Cypris came upon them, because for a long time they had grudged her the honours due."[^arg1-wrath] The women killed not only their husbands but every male on the island, "that they might thereafter pay no retribution for the grim murder."[^arg1-massacre] Among all the women, "Hypsipyle alone spared her aged father Thoas, who was king over the people; and she sent him in a hollow chest, to drift over the sea, if haply he should escape."[^arg1-thoas] Fishermen dragged Thoas to shore at the island of Oenoe (afterwards called Sicinus, from a son borne to him by a water-nymph).

[^arg1-wrath]: "for the men had rejected their lawful wives, loathing them, and had conceived a fierce passion for captive maids whom they themselves brought across the sea from their forays in Thrace; for the terrible wrath of Cypris came upon them, because for a long time they had grudged her the honours due" (Argonautica 1.612-616, trans. R.C. Seaton)
[^arg1-massacre]: "Not their husbands alone with the captives did they slay on account of the marriage-bed, but all the males at the same time, that they might thereafter pay no retribution for the grim murder" (Argonautica 1.617-620)
[^arg1-thoas]: "of all the women, Hypsipyle alone spared her aged father Thoas, who was king over the people; and she sent him in a hollow chest, to drift over the sea, if haply he should escape" (Argonautica 1.621-623)

### Ruling Lemnos

In the time between the massacre and the Argo's arrival, the Lemnian women had taken on men's tasks — tending cattle, wearing bronze armour, ploughing wheat-bearing fields — while living in constant fear of Thracian reprisal. When they spotted the Argo approaching, they armed themselves and poured out to the beach "like ravening Thyiades," believing the Thracians had come; "with them Hypsipyle, daughter of Thoas, donned her father's harness."[^arg1-harness]

[^arg1-harness]: "with them Hypsipyle, daughter of Thoas, donned her father's harness. And they streamed down speechless with dismay; such fear was wafted about them" (Argonautica 1.636-638)

### The Assembly

When the herald Aethalides persuaded the women to receive the strangers, Hypsipyle called an assembly of all the Lemnian women, addressed them first, and "sat upon her father's seat of stone."[^arg1-seat] Her initial counsel was to send the men gifts of food and wine but keep them outside the city walls, so they would not learn of the massacre. Her old nurse Polyxo rose after her and argued the practical case for welcoming the strangers: the women needed men for defence and children or they would grow old alone. The assembly agreed, and Hypsipyle summoned Jason to the city.

[^arg1-seat]: "she spake and sat upon her father's seat of stone" (Argonautica 1.668)

### Jason's Visit

Jason came to Hypsipyle's palace. She received him on a shining seat opposite herself, turning her eyes aside as "a blush covered her maiden cheeks, yet for all her modesty she addressed him with crafty words."[^arg1-blush] In her speech to him, she gave a modified account of the island's history: she said the men had gone to Thrace and were living there still, not that they had been killed. She offered Jason her father's throne and the rule of Lemnos: "assuredly thou shalt have the prerogative of my father Thoas; and I deem that thou wilt not scorn our land at all, for it is deepsoiled beyond all other islands that lie in the Aegaean sea."[^arg1-offer]

Jason declined rule of the island, saying grievous trials pressed him on, but touched her hand and promised to return. After he relayed her words to the crew, the maids led all the men back to their homes, and Jason went to stay with Hypsipyle. "[Cypris](../deities/aphrodite.md) stirred in them a sweet desire, for the sake of Hephaestus of many counsels, in order that Lemnos might be again inhabited by men and not be ruined."[^arg1-cypris]

[^arg1-blush]: "Hypsipyle turned her eyes aside and a blush covered her maiden cheeks, yet for all her modesty she addressed him with crafty words" (Argonautica 1.794-796)
[^arg1-offer]: "assuredly thou shalt have the prerogative of my father Thoas; and I deem that thou wilt not scorn our land at all, for it is deepsoiled beyond all other islands that lie in the Aegaean sea" (Argonautica 1.828-830)
[^arg1-cypris]: "Cypris stirred in them a sweet desire, for the sake of Hephaestus of many counsels, in order that Lemnos might be again inhabited by men and not be ruined" (Argonautica 1.850-852)

### Heracles' Rebuke and Departure

The Argonauts lingered at Lemnos from day to day; the sailing was always delayed. At last [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md), who had remained by the ship with a few chosen comrades, gathered the heroes apart from the women and reproached them: "No fair renown shall we win by thus tarrying so long with stranger women; nor will some god seize and give us at our prayer a fleece that moves of itself. Let us then return each to his own; but him leave ye to rest all day long in the embrace of Hypsipyle until he has peopled Lemnos with men-children, and so there come to him great glory."[^arg1-heracles]

At the news of their departure, Hypsipyle seized Jason's hands and wept, praying for his safe return and offering him the island and her father's sceptre should he wish to return after the quest. She asked him to remember her when far away, and if she should bear a son, to send the child when grown to Iolcus to care for his ageing parents.[^arg1-farewell] Jason answered that if he could not return to Hellas, and if she bore a male child, she should send him to Iolcus "to heal the grief of my father and mother if so be that he find them still living."[^arg1-jason-reply]

[^arg1-heracles]: "No fair renown shall we win by thus tarrying so long with stranger women; nor will some god seize and give us at our prayer a fleece that moves of itself. Let us then return each to his own; but him leave ye to rest all day long in the embrace of Hypsipyle until he has peopled Lemnos with men-children, and so there come to him great glory" (Argonautica 1.869-874)
[^arg1-farewell]: "still remember Hypsipyle when thou art far away and when thou hast returned; and leave me some word of bidding, which I will gladly accomplish, if haply heaven shall grant me to be a mother" (Argonautica 1.895-898)
[^arg1-jason-reply]: "if thou shouldst bear a male child, send him when grown up to Pelasgian Iolcus, to heal the grief of my father and mother if so be that he find them still living" (Argonautica 1.905-908)

### Later Mentions

Hypsipyle is mentioned again later in the poem. Jason wore at Colchis "a dark robe, which Hypsipyle of Lemnos had given him as a pledge of hospitality."[^arg3-robe] The sacred robe of Hypsipyle, of crimson hue, is described as originally the gift of Dionysus to Thoas, passed to his son and then to Hypsipyle, who gave it to Jason.[^arg4-robe]

[^arg3-robe]: "round him he placed a dark robe, which Hypsipyle of Lemnos had given him as a pledge of hospitality" (Argonautica 3.1204)
[^arg4-robe]: "sacred robe of Hypsipyle, of crimson hue. The Graces with their own hands wove it for Dionysus, and he gave it to his son Thoas thereafter, and Thoas left it to Hypsipyle, and she gave it to Jason" (Argonautica 4.424-427)
