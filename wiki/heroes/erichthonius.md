## Overview

**Erichthonius** was a king of Athens with a miraculous birth: he sprang from the earth when [Hephaestus](../deities/hephaestus.md)'s seed fell on the ground during his pursuit of [Athena](../deities/athena.md). Athena raised him, put him in a chest given to the daughters of [Cecrops](cecrops.md), and on his coming of age he expelled Amphictyon, became king of Athens, established the wooden image of Athena on the acropolis, and founded the Panathenaic festival.

## In the [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md)

### Birth (3.14.6)

Apollodorus gives two traditions for Erichthonius's parentage. In one, he was the son of Hephaestus and Atthis, daughter of Cranaus. In the other — presented in more detail — he was born as follows:

[Athena](../deities/athena.md) came to [Hephaestus](../deities/hephaestus.md) "desirous of fashioning arms." Hephaestus, having been forsaken by [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md), fell in love with Athena and pursued her. Being lame, he caught up with her only with difficulty. "He attempted to embrace her; but she, being a chaste virgin, would not submit to him, and he dropped his seed on the leg of the goddess. In disgust, she wiped off the seed with wool and threw it on the ground; and as she fled and the seed fell on the ground, Erichthonius was produced."[^apd-erich-birth]

### The Chest (3.14.6)

Athena "brought him up unknown to the other gods, wishing to make him immortal." She placed him in a chest and entrusted it to Pandrosus, daughter of [Cecrops](cecrops.md), "forbidding her to open the chest."[^apd-erich-chest]

The sisters of Pandrosus opened it out of curiosity and saw "a serpent coiled about the babe." Their fate in two traditions: "as some say, they were destroyed by the serpent, but according to others they were driven mad by reason of the anger of Athena and threw themselves down from the acropolis."[^apd-erich-serpent]

### Reign (3.14.6)

Having been raised by Athena in her own precinct, Erichthonius expelled Amphictyon and became king of Athens. He "set up the wooden image of Athena in the acropolis, and instituted the festival of the Panathenaea."[^apd-erich-king] He married Praxithea, a Naiad nymph, and by her had a son [Pandion](pandion.md).[^apd-erich-pandion]

### Death (3.14.7)

"When Erichthonius died and was buried in the same precinct of Athena, Pandion became king."[^apd-erich-death]

## In the Iliad

The [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) refers to the holder of Athens in the Catalogue of Ships as "Erechtheus the high-hearted, whom erst Athene daughter of Zeus fostered when Earth, the grain-giver, brought him to birth; and she gave him a resting-place in Athens in her own rich sanctuary."[^il2-erich] The Iliad uses the name Erechtheus where Apollodorus distinguishes Erichthonius as the earlier figure; in the Iliad these are likely conflated.

## In the Fabulae

The [Fabulae](../sources/hyginus.md) (§166) gives a variant account: [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) urged [Hephaestus](../deities/hephaestus.md) to ask for Athena in marriage, and Hephaestus entered her chamber; Athena defended her virginity with arms. During the struggle "some of his seed fell to earth, and from it a boy was born, the lower part of whose body was snake-formed." The name carries etymological meaning: "They named him Erichthonius, because eris in Greek means 'strife', and khthon means 'earth'."

Athena gave the infant in a chest to Cecrops's daughters to guard. A crow revealed the secret when the girls opened the chest, and "they, driven mad by Minerva, threw themselves into the sea."
