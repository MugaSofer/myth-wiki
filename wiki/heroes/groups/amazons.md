## Overview

The **Amazons** were a nation of female warriors who dwelt around the river Thermodon on the southern coast of the Black Sea. They were renowned in Greek myth as military equals of men — Homer calls them "the peers of men" — and appear as adversaries of some of the greatest heroes: [Bellerophon](../bellerophon.md), [Heracles](../heracles.md), [Theseus](../theseus.md), and [Achilles](../achilles.md). Their queens were daughters of [Ares](../../deities/ares.md), and their society was devoted exclusively to war.

## Society and Customs

[Apollodorus](../../sources/apollodorus.md) gives the most detailed account of Amazon society. [Hippolyte](../hippolyte.md) "was queen of the Amazons, who dwelt about the river Thermodon, a people great in war; for they cultivated the manly virtues, and if ever they gave birth to children through intercourse with the other sex, they reared the females; and they pinched off the right breasts that they might not be trammelled by them in throwing the javelin, but they kept the left breasts, that they might suckle."[^apd-society]

[^apd-society]: "She was queen of the Amazons, who dwelt about the river Thermodon, a people great in war; for they cultivated the manly virtues, and if ever they gave birth to children through intercourse with the other sex, they reared the females; and they pinched off the right breasts that they might not be trammelled by them in throwing the javelin, but they kept the left breasts, that they might suckle" (Bibliotheca 2.5.9, trans. J.G. Frazer)

## Geography

The Amazons' homeland was centred on the Thermodon River and the city of Themiscyra, on the Black Sea coast. [Apollonius](../../sources/argonautica.md) reports that they "dwelt not gathered together in one city, but scattered over the land, parted into three tribes" — the Themiscyreians, the Lycastians, and the Chadesians (dart-throwers).[^argo-tribes]

Queens Otrere and Antiope built a stone temple of [Ares](../../deities/ares.md) on the coast, where the Amazons sacrificed horses before going to war.[^argo-temple]

[^argo-tribes]: Argonautica 2.992-1000, trans. R.C. Seaton
[^argo-temple]: "the Queens of the Amazons, Otrere and Antiope, built a stone temple of Ares what time they went forth to war" (Argonautica 2.1000-1001, trans. R.C. Seaton)

## Named Amazons

| Name | Role | Sources |
|------|------|---------|
| [Hippolyte](../hippolyte.md) | Queen; wore the belt of Ares; married [Theseus](../theseus.md); mother of [Hippolytus](../hippolytus.md) | [Bibliotheca](../../sources/apollodorus.md), [Argonautica](../../sources/argonautica.md) |
| Penthesilea | Daughter of Otrere and [Ares](../../deities/ares.md); came to Troy as Priam's ally; killed by [Achilles](../achilles.md) | [Bibliotheca](../../sources/apollodorus.md) E.5.1, [Epic Cycle](../../sources/epic-cycle.md) |
| Otrere | Queen; mother of Penthesilea; built temple of Ares | [Bibliotheca](../../sources/apollodorus.md), [Argonautica](../../sources/argonautica.md) |
| Antiope | Queen; built temple of Ares with Otrere; in some accounts the Amazon captured by [Theseus](../theseus.md) | [Bibliotheca](../../sources/apollodorus.md), [Argonautica](../../sources/argonautica.md) |
| Melanippe | Sister of Hippolyte; captured by [Heracles](../heracles.md); ransomed for the belt | [Argonautica](../../sources/argonautica.md) |

[Hyginus](../../sources/hyginus.md) lists fifteen Amazons: Ocyale, Dioxippe, Iphinome, Xanthe, Hippothoe, Otrere, Antioche, Laomache, Glauce, Agave, Theseis, Hippolyte, Clymene, Polydora, and Penthesilea.[^hyg-list]

[^hyg-list]: Fabulae §163

## Military Equipment

[Virgil](../../sources/aeneid.md) describes the Amazons in martial terms: Penthesilea leads "crescent-shielded Amazonian columns in furious heat with thousands around her; clasping a golden belt under her naked breast, the warrior maiden clashes boldly with men."[^aen-penthesilea] Their characteristic arms include crescent-shaped shields, painted armour, bows, javelins, and war chariots.[^aen-equipment]

[^aen-penthesilea]: "Penthesilea leads her crescent-shielded Amazonian columns in furious heat with thousands around her; clasping a golden belt under her naked breast, the warrior maiden clashes boldly with men" (Aeneid 1.490-493, trans. J.W. Mackail)
[^aen-equipment]: "even as Thracian Amazons when the streams of Thermodon clash beneath them as they go to war in painted arms" (Aeneid 11.659-660, trans. J.W. Mackail)

## In the Iliad

The Amazons are mentioned twice. In Book III, [Priam](../priam.md) recalls fighting alongside the Phrygians "on the day that the Amazons came, the peers of men."[^il3-peers] In Book VI, [Bellerophon](../bellerophon.md) was sent "to combat the Amazons" as one of the impossible tasks meant to kill him.[^il6-bellerophon]

[^il3-peers]: "on the day that the Amazons came, the peers of men. Yet were not even they so many as are the glancing-eyed Achaians" (Iliad 3.189-190, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il6-bellerophon]: Iliad 6.186

## Heracles' Ninth Labour

[Heracles](../heracles.md) was sent to fetch the belt of [Ares](../../deities/ares.md) worn by Queen [Hippolyte](../hippolyte.md). [Apollodorus](../../sources/apollodorus.md) reports that Hippolyte was initially willing to give the belt, but [Hera](../../deities/hera.md) stirred the Amazons to attack, and Heracles killed Hippolyte in the resulting battle.[^apd-labour]

[Apollonius](../../sources/argonautica.md) gives a variant in which Heracles captured Melanippe, Hippolyte's sister, by ambush: "Hippolyte gave him her glistening girdle as her sister's ransom, and he sent away his captive unharmed."[^argo-ransom]

[^apd-labour]: Bibliotheca 2.5.9
[^argo-ransom]: "when Melanippe, daughter of Ares, had gone forth, the hero Heracles caught her by ambuscade and Hippolyte gave him her glistening girdle as her sister's ransom, and he sent away his captive unharmed" (Argonautica 2.966-969, trans. R.C. Seaton)

## The Invasion of Athens

[Theseus](../theseus.md) joined Heracles on the expedition and "carried off Antiope, or, as some say, Melanippe; but Simonides calls her Hippolyte." In retaliation, "the Amazons marched against Athens, and having taken up a position about the [Areopagus](../../places/areopagus.md) they were vanquished by the Athenians under Theseus."[^apd-athens]

When Theseus later married [Phaedra](../phaedra.md), "the Amazon that had before been married to him appeared in arms with her Amazons, and threatened to kill the assembled guests. But they hastily closed the doors and killed her."[^apd-wedding]

[^apd-athens]: "Theseus joined Hercules in his expedition against the Amazons and carried off Antiope, or, as some say, Melanippe; but Simonides calls her Hippolyte. Wherefore the Amazons marched against Athens, and having taken up a position about the Areopagus they were vanquished by the Athenians under Theseus" (Bibliotheca E.1.16, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-wedding]: "the Amazon that had before been married to him appeared in arms with her Amazons, and threatened to kill the assembled guests. But they hastily closed the doors and killed her" (Bibliotheca E.1.17, trans. J.G. Frazer)

## Penthesilea at Troy

After [Hector](../hector.md)'s death, Penthesilea came to Troy as an ally of [Priam](../priam.md). She was "daughter of Otrere and Ares" and had "accidentally killed Hippolyte" — Priam purified her of this blood-guilt. "In battle she slew many, and amongst them Machaon, and was afterwards herself killed by [Achilles](../achilles.md), who fell in love with the Amazon after her death and slew Thersites for jeering at him."[^apd-penthesilea]

The [Epic Cycle](../../sources/epic-cycle.md) (Aethiopis) confirms: "The Amazon Penthesilea, the daughter of Ares and of Thracian race, comes to aid the Trojans."[^ec-penthesilea]

[^apd-penthesilea]: "Penthesilia, daughter of Otrere and Ares, accidentally killed Hippolyte and was purified by Priam. In battle she slew many, and amongst them Machaon, and was afterwards herself killed by Achilles, who fell in love with the Amazon after her death and slew Thersites for jeering at him" (Bibliotheca E.5.1, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^ec-penthesilea]: Epic Cycle, Aethiopis (summary by Proclus, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Variant Traditions

The identity of the Amazon queen captured by Theseus is one of the most confused points in Greek mythology. [Apollodorus](../../sources/apollodorus.md) notes the alternatives: "Antiope, or, as some say, Melanippe; but Simonides calls her Hippolyte." He further notes that "Hippolyte was the mother of Hippolytus; she also goes by the names of Glauce and Melanippe."[^apd-names] Whether the captured queen, the mother of [Hippolytus](../hippolytus.md), and the Amazon killed at Phaedra's wedding are the same woman is left unresolved by the sources.

[^apd-names]: "Hippolyte was the mother of Hippolytus; she also goes by the names of Glauce and Melanippe" (Bibliotheca E.5.2, trans. J.G. Frazer)
