## Overview

**Caeneus** was a Thessalian warrior, born a woman named Caenis. After being ravished by [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md), she asked to be transformed into a man and made [invulnerable](../concepts/invulnerability.md) to weapons. Caeneus became a famous fighter, killing many [centaurs](../creatures/centaurs.md) at the wedding of Pirithous and Hippodamia, before the surviving centaurs buried him alive under a heap of trees.

## In the Bibliotheca

[Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) gives a concise account: "Caeneus was formerly a woman, but after that Poseidon had intercourse with her, she asked to become an invulnerable man; wherefore in the battle with the centaurs he thought scorn of wounds and killed many of the centaurs; but the rest of them surrounded him and by striking him with fir trees buried him in the earth."[^apd-caeneus]

## In the Metamorphoses

Ovid provides the fullest account, told as a story-within-a-story by [Nestor](nestor.md) at a feast hosted by [Achilles](achilles.md) after the slaying of [Cygnus](cygnus.md). The conversation had turned to Cygnus's [invulnerability](../concepts/invulnerability.md), and Nestor declared: "During your time, Cygnus has been the only man you knew who could despise all weapons and whose flesh could not be pierced by thrust of sword or spear. But long ago I saw another man able to bear unharmed a thousand strokes, Caeneus of Thessaly."[^met-nestor-intro]

### Origin

Nestor tells how "The daughter of Elatus, Caenis, was remarkable for charm — most beautiful of all Thessalian maidens."[^met-caenis-beauty] While walking on a lonely shore, "the god of ocean saw and ravished her."[^met-rape] Poseidon then offered to grant any wish, and Caenis replied: "The great wrong, which I have suffered from you justifies the wonderful request that I must make; I ask that I may never suffer such an injury again. Grant I may be no longer woman, and I'll ask no more."[^met-wish] As she spoke, her voice deepened — "Neptune not only had allowed her prayer but made the new man proof against all wounds of spear or sword. Rejoicing in the gift he went his way as Caeneus Atracides, spent years in every manful exercise, and roamed the plains of northern Thessaly."[^met-transformation]

### Battle with the Centaurs

At the wedding of Pirithous and Hippodamia, the centaur Eurytus sparked a brawl by seizing the bride, and a full battle erupted between the Lapiths and the centaurs. Caeneus killed five centaurs: Styphelus, Bromus, Antimachus, Elymus, and Pyracmos.[^met-five-slain]

The centaur Latreus taunted him: "Shall I put up with one like you, O Caeneus? For you are still a woman in my sight."[^met-latreus-taunt] But Caeneus hurled a spear through the centaur's side. When Latreus struck back with his pike, "His pike rebounded as the hail that slants up from the roof." He tried his sword: "the flesh resounded like a marble block, the keen blade shattered on the unyielding skin."[^met-invulnerability] Caeneus then plunged his sword through Latreus's shoulder to the hilt.

The surviving centaurs, "quite beside themselves," rushed against Caeneus en masse: "Their blunted weapons fell and he remained unharmed and without even a mark."[^met-centaurs-rush] The centaur Monychus rallied them: "Let us heap tree-trunks and stones and mountains on him! Crush his stubborn life! Let forests smother him to death! Their weight will be as deadly as a hundred wounds!"[^met-monychus]

They buried Caeneus under entire forests stripped from Mount Othrys and Pelion. "Caeneus heaved up against the weight of oaks upon his brawny shoulders piled. But, as the load increased above his face and head, he could not draw a breath."[^met-burial] From the midst of the pile, a golden-winged bird was seen flying upward — an event witnessed by the seer Mopsus, who cried: "Hail, glory of the Lapithaean race, their greatest hero, now a bird unique!"[^met-bird]

## In the Argonautica

[Apollonius](../sources/argonautica.md) mentions Caeneus's son Coronus among the Argonauts, and adds: "bards relate that Caeneus though still living perished at the hands of the Centaurs, when apart from other chiefs he routed them; and they, rallying against him, could neither bend nor slay him; but unconquered and unflinching he passed beneath the earth, overwhelmed by the downrush of massy pines."[^arg-caeneus]

## In the Fabulae

[Hyginus](../sources/hyginus.md) lists Caeneus among the Argonauts, noting: "This Caeneus, son of Elatus, a Magnesian, proved that in no way could the Centaurs wound him with steel, but they did so with trunks of trees sharpened to a point."[^hyg-argonauts] Hyginus adds a sceptical editorial remark: "Some say that he was once a woman, and in answer to her petition, Neptune for her favors granted that she be turned into a man, and be invulnerable to any blow. This has never been done, nor is it possible for any mortal by invulnerability to escape death by steel, or be changed from a woman into a man."[^hyg-sceptical]

Hyginus also lists Caeneus among the hunters of the [Calydonian Boar](../events/calydonian-boar.md) and — curiously — among those who committed suicide, without further explanation.[^hyg-suicide]

## In the Aeneid

[Virgil](../sources/aeneid.md) places Caeneus among the shades in the Underworld, noting "she who was once Caeneus" — reverting to the female form in death.[^aen-shade]
