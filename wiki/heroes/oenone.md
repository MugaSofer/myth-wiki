## Overview

**Oenone** was a nymph of Mount Ida, daughter of the river-god Cebren, and the first wife of [Paris](paris.md). She possessed the art of healing, taught her by Rhea. When Paris left her for [Helen](helen.md), she prophesied disaster. Years later, when Paris was mortally wounded by [Philoctetes](philoctetes.md)' poisoned arrow, he crawled back to Ida to beg her aid. She refused bitterly — then, overcome by grief and remorse, ran to his funeral pyre and leapt into the flames. The sources agree on her loyalty and Paris's faithlessness, though they differ on how she died.

## In the Bibliotheca

[Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) records that Paris's first wife was "Oenone, daughter of Cebren." She "had learned from Rhea the art of prophecy, and warned Alexander not to sail to fetch [Helen](helen.md)." When Paris was later mortally wounded, "he went back to Oenone on Ida. But she, nursing her grievance, refused to heal him. So Alexander was carried to [Troy](../places/troy.md) and died. But Oenone repented her, and brought the healing drugs; and finding him dead she hanged herself."[^apd]

## In the Posthomerica

### Paris's Plea

After [Philoctetes](philoctetes.md) shot Paris with the poisoned arrows of [Heracles](heracles.md), Paris fled the battlefield and made his way to Ida, "as one with sickness and tormenting thirst consumed." He begged Oenone: "O reverenced wife, turn not from me in hate for that I left thee widowed long ago! Not of my will I did it: the strong Fates dragged me to Helen — oh that I had died ere I embraced her — in thine arms had died!" He pleaded by the memory of their marriage and warned that the Prayers, daughters of Zeus, punish those who refuse suppliants: "My queen, I sinned, in folly sinned; yet from death save me — oh, make haste to save!"[^post-plea]

### Oenone's Refusal

Her heart was steeled. She mocked his agony: "Thou comest unto me! — thou, who didst leave erewhile a wailing wife in a desolate home! — Didst leave her for thy Tyndarid darling! Go, lie laughing in her arms for bliss!" She wished she had the strength of a tigress "that I might tear thy flesh and lap thy blood for all the pain thy folly brought on me!" She asked where [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md) was now: "Where now is Love's Queen glory-crowned? Hath Zeus forgotten his daughter's paramour? Have them for thy deliverers!" She drove him from her doors: "Hence from my threshold! — to thine Helen go! Agonize day and night beside her bed."[^post-refusal]

### Paris's Death on Ida

Paris stumbled down through Ida's slopes, led by Doom to his death. [Hera](../deities/hera.md) watched from Olympus with a rejoicing soul. Paris died on the mountain and "never Helen saw him more." The nymphs wailed around him, "for they still remembered how their nursling wont to lisp his childish prattle, compassed with their smiles."[^post-death]

### Oenone's Grief and Self-Immolation

While [Helen](helen.md) wailed publicly but thought only of herself, and the women of [Troy](../places/troy.md) mourned their own losses, "one only heart was pierced with grief unfeigned, Oenone." She lay "far away within that desolate home moaning... on her lost husband's bed." She melted in tears "as when the copses on high mountains stand white-veiled with frozen snow... but now the sun and east-wind melt it fast." She cried: "Woe for my wickedness! O hateful life! I loved mine hapless husband — dreamed with him to pace to eld's bright threshold hand in hand."[^post-grief]

That night, secretly, she slid back the bolts and rushed forth "like a storm-blast," running through the mountains to Paris's pyre. The moon-goddess Selene "looked on her, and remembered her own love, princely Endymion, and she pitied her in that wild race, and, shining overhead in her full brightness, made the long tracks plain."[^post-run]

She reached the burning pyre where shepherds and nymphs stood mourning. "She raised no wail, the broken-hearted, when she saw him there, but, in her mantle muffling up her face, leapt on the pyre." She burned clasping Paris. The nymphs whispered: "Verily evil-hearted Paris was, who left a leal true wife, and took for bride a wanton, to himself and Troy a curse."[^post-pyre]

### The Tomb

When the fire had "made twain one," the shepherds quenched the embers with wine, placed the bones in a golden vase, and raised a mound. They set "two pillars there that each from other ever turn away; for the old jealousy in the marble lives."[^post-tomb]

## In the Metamorphoses

[Ovid](../sources/metamorphoses.md) refers to Paris being abandoned by Oenone during the sack of Troy sequence but does not tell the story in full.

## Variant Traditions

The sources agree that Oenone refused to heal Paris and then killed herself in grief, but differ on the manner of her death:

- In [Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md), she brought healing drugs too late, found Paris dead, and **hanged herself**.
- In the [Posthomerica](../sources/posthomerica.md), she never relents; instead she runs to the pyre and **immolates herself** on Paris's body, burning together with him.

The Posthomerica's version is more elaborate and dramatic: Oenone's refusal is given in full bitter dialogue, and her death-run through the mountains by moonlight — with Selene's sympathy — is one of the poem's most striking passages.
