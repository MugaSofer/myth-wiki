## Overview

**Antilochus** was the eldest son of [Nestor](nestor.md) and one of the younger Greek commanders at [Troy](../places/troy.md). In the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md), he appears as a swift runner, daring charioteer, and close companion of [Achilles](achilles.md) — the one chosen to bring him the news of [Patroclus](patroclus.md)' death. He was killed by [Memnon](memnon.md) in the fighting that followed [Penthesilea](penthesilea.md)'s death, and his loss drove Achilles to the battle that would prove his own last.

## In the Iliad

Antilochus appears throughout the poem as an active young fighter. He is "blameless Antilochus" and fights among the front ranks. In Book XV, Antilochus is one of the fighters who defend the ships.[^il15]

In Book XVII, he is the one chosen to bring the terrible news of [Patroclus](patroclus.md)' death to Achilles: "[Menelaus](menelaus.md) could not think to stay and succour the fallen... but he put Antilochus in command of the Pylians, and gave him Patroclus' horses, and went himself to bear the heavy tidings to Achilles." Antilochus wept at the news but went: "he fell a-weeping, and his hands let fall to the ground the spear."[^il17-messenger]

In Book XXIII, at the funeral games for Patroclus, Antilochus competes in the chariot race. His father Nestor advises him: "by craft is the woodman far better than by might." During the race he makes a daring and somewhat reckless move against [Menelaus](menelaus.md), cutting him off at a narrow pass. Menelaus rebukes him afterwards, but Antilochus apologises gracefully and offers to return the prize mare, at which Menelaus relents.[^il23-race]

## In the Posthomerica

### Death at Memnon's Hands

When [Memnon](memnon.md) pressed the Greeks back, Antilochus charged to face him. He "strode forth to meet him, sped the long spear's flight, yet missed him, for a little he swerved," killing an Aethiopian instead. Antilochus then hurled a stone at Memnon's head, which merely rang off the helm. Memnon's fury grew and "he stabbed, for all his cunning of fence, the son of Nestor above the breast; the crashing spear plunged to the heart, the spot of speediest death."[^post-death]

His father [Nestor](nestor.md) was anguished: "no more bitter pang smiteth the heart of man than when a son perisheth, and his father sees him die." Nestor summoned Thrasymedes and Phereus but none could challenge Memnon, who stripped the armour from the body while sparing old Nestor out of chivalry.[^post-nestor-grief]

Nestor then found Achilles: "Achilles, thou great bulwark of the Greeks, slain is my child!" This brought Achilles to the duel with Memnon that ended Memnon's life.[^post-nestor-plea]

### Burial

After Memnon's death, the Pylian spearmen "bore Antilochus' corpse, sore sighing for their prince, and by the Hellespont they buried him with aching hearts."[^post-burial]

[^post-death]: "he stabbed, for all his cunning of fence, the son of Nestor above the breast; the crashing spear plunged to the heart, the spot of speediest death" (Posthomerica 2.1764-1766, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post-nestor-grief]: "no more bitter pang smiteth the heart of man than when a son perisheth, and his father sees him die" (Posthomerica 2.1771-1773, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post-nestor-plea]: "Achilles, thou great bulwark of the Greeks, slain is my child! The armour of my dead hath Memnon" (Posthomerica 2.1924-1926, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post-burial]: "to the ships the Pylian spearmen bore Antilochus' corpse, sore sighing for their prince, and by the Hellespont they buried him with aching hearts" (Posthomerica 3.2281-2284, trans. A.S. Way)

## In Other Sources

The [Epic Cycle](../sources/epic-cycle.md) (Aethiopis) confirms the basic account: Memnon kills Antilochus, and Achilles then kills Memnon.[^ec-antilochus]

[Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) lists Antilochus among the Greeks at Troy and records his death at Memnon's hands.[^apd]
