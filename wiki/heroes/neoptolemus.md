## Overview

**Neoptolemus** (also called **Pyrrhus**) was the son of [Achilles](achilles.md), born on the island of Scyros while his father hid among the daughters of King Lycomedes. He was brought to [Troy](../places/troy.md) after his father's death because a prophecy declared the city could not fall without him. There he proved himself his father's equal in prowess, and during the sack of Troy killed the aged king [Priam](priam.md) at the altar of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md). The sources consistently portray him as fierce and ruthless — [Virgil](../sources/aeneid.md) compares him to a snake "fresh from his weeds outworn and shining in youth."[^aen-snake]

## Names

[Hyginus](../sources/hyginus.md) explains both names: "he was called Pyrrhus from his father who was disguised as the girl Pyrrha," since [Achilles](achilles.md) had tawny hair and "in Greek a redhead is called *pyrrhos*."[^hyg-name] The name Neoptolemus ("new warrior") reflects his arrival late in the war.

## In the Odyssey

[Odysseus](odysseus.md) gives the most favourable account of Neoptolemus, telling the ghost of [Achilles](achilles.md) about his son's deeds at Troy. "It was I that led him up out of Scyros in my good hollow ship, in the wake of the goodly-greaved Achaeans."[^od-scyros]

In council, "he was ever the first to speak, and no word missed the mark; the godlike Nestor and I alone surpassed him." In battle, "he never tarried behind in the throng or the press of men, but ran out far before us all, yielding to none in that might of his. And many men he slew in warfare dread."[^od-prowess]

Odysseus highlights two specific feats: Neoptolemus "smote with the sword that son of Telephus, the hero Eurypylus, and many Ceteians of his company were slain around him." He was "the comeliest man that ever I saw, next to goodly Memnon."[^od-eurypylus]

Inside the wooden horse, Neoptolemus showed extraordinary courage: "never once did I see thy son's fair face wax pale, nor did he wipe the tears from his cheeks: but he besought me often to let him go forth from the horse, and kept handling his sword-hilt, and his heavy bronze-shod spear, and he was set on mischief against the Trojans."[^od-horse]

After Troy's fall, "he embarked unscathed with his share of the spoil, and with a noble prize; he was not smitten with the sharp spear, and got no wound in close fight."[^od-unscathed] Achilles' ghost, hearing this, "passed with great strides along the mead of asphodel, rejoicing in that I had told him of his son's renown."[^od-rejoicing]

## In the Bibliotheca

### Birth

[Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) records that when [Achilles](achilles.md) was hidden at Lycomedes' court on Scyros, "Achilles had an intrigue with Deidamia, daughter of Lycomedes, and a son Pyrrhus was born to him, who was afterwards called Neoptolemus."[^apd-birth]

### Summoned to Troy

After Achilles' death, the seer Helenus was captured and "forced to tell how Ilium could be taken," revealing three conditions: "first, if the bones of Pelops were brought to them; next, if Neoptolemus fought for them; and third, if the Palladium... were stolen from Troy."[^apd-conditions]

Odysseus and Phoenix went to Scyros and "persuaded him to let Neoptolemus go. On coming to the camp and receiving his father's arms from Ulysses, who willingly resigned them, Neoptolemus slew many of the Trojans."[^apd-arms] He also "slew Eurypylus, son of Telephus," who had "arrived to fight for the Trojans, bringing a great force of Mysians."[^apd-eurypylus]

### The Sack of Troy

During the sack, "Neoptolemus slew Priam, who had taken refuge at the altar of Zeus of the Courtyard."[^apd-priam] In the division of spoils, "Neoptolemus got Andromache."[^apd-spoils]

### After the War

[Thetis](../deities/thetis.md) "persuaded Neoptolemus to wait two days and to offer sacrifice" before departing, saving him from the storm that wrecked many Greek ships.[^apd-thetis] He then "set out for the country of the Molossians by land with Helenus, and on the way Phoenix died, and Neoptolemus buried him; and having vanquished the Molossians in battle he reigned as king and begat Molossus on Andromache."[^apd-molossia]

He gave Helenus his mother Deidamia in marriage, and "when Peleus was expelled from Phthia by the sons of Acastus and died, Neoptolemus succeeded to his father's kingdom."[^apd-phthia]

### Death

"When Orestes went mad, Neoptolemus carried off his wife Hermione, who had previously been betrothed to him in Troy; and for that reason he was slain by Orestes at Delphi."[^apd-death-orestes] Apollodorus adds a variant: "some say that he went to Delphi to demand satisfaction from Apollo for the death of his father, and that he rifled the votive offerings and set fire to the temple, and was on that account slain by Machaereus the Phocian."[^apd-death-delphi]

## In the Aeneid

[Virgil](../sources/aeneid.md) gives the most dramatic account of Neoptolemus at the sack of Troy, narrated by [Aeneas](aeneas.md) himself: "Myself I saw in the gateway Neoptolemus mad in slaughter."[^aen-gateway]

He is introduced with a vivid simile: "right before the vestibule and in the front doorway Pyrrhus moves rejoicingly in the sparkle of arms and gleaming brass: like as when a snake fed on poisonous herbs, whom chill winter kept hid and swollen underground, now fresh from his weeds outworn and shining in youth, wreathes his slippery body into the daylight, his upreared breast meets the sun, and his triple-cloven tongue flickers in his mouth."[^aen-snake]

The killing of Priam is extended into a scene of horror. First Pyrrhus kills Polites, one of Priam's sons, before his parents' eyes. Priam hurls a feeble spear and denounces him: "not such to a foe was the Achilles whose parentage thou beliest; but he revered a suppliant's right and trust, restored to the tomb Hector's pallid corpse, and sent me back to my realm."[^aen-priam-speech] Pyrrhus replies: "thou then shalt tell this, and go with the message to my sire the son of Peleus: remember to tell him of my baleful deeds, and the degeneracy of Neoptolemus. Now die." He "drew him quivering to the very altar, slipping in the pool of his child's blood, and wound his left hand in his hair, while in his right the sword flashed out and plunged to the hilt in his side."[^aen-priam-death]

## In the Fabulae

[Hyginus](../sources/hyginus.md) lists Neoptolemus among the warriors in the wooden horse and notes he "slew 6" Trojans in the war.[^hyg-kills] In the list of combat matchups: "Neoptolemus with Eurypylus; Eurypylus was killed."[^hyg-combat]

## Variant Traditions

The sources agree on Neoptolemus's ferocity at Troy but differ on his fate:

- In [Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md), he is killed at Delphi either by [Orestes](orestes.md) (over [Hermione](hermione.md)) or by a Phocian (for desecrating the temple).
- In the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md), he departs Troy unscathed with no mention of a later death.
- [Virgil](../sources/aeneid.md) condemns him through Aeneas's eyes as a savage, while Homer's Odysseus portrays him as admirably brave.

Priam's dying speech in the Aeneid explicitly contrasts Neoptolemus unfavourably with his father — Achilles respected suppliants and returned Hector's body, while Pyrrhus slaughters at the altar.
