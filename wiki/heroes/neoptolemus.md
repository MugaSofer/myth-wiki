## Overview

**Neoptolemus** (also called **Pyrrhus**) was the son of [Achilles](achilles.md), born on the island of Scyros while his father hid among the daughters of King Lycomedes. He was brought to [Troy](../places/troy.md) after his father's death because a prophecy declared the city could not fall without him. There he proved himself his father's equal in prowess, and during the sack of Troy killed the aged king [Priam](priam.md) at the altar of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md). The sources consistently portray him as fierce and ruthless — [Virgil](../sources/aeneid.md) compares him to a snake "fresh from his weeds outworn and shining in youth."[^aen-snake]

## Names

[Hyginus](../sources/hyginus.md) explains both names: "he was called Pyrrhus from his father who was disguised as the girl Pyrrha," since [Achilles](achilles.md) had tawny hair and "in Greek a redhead is called *pyrrhos*."[^hyg-name] The name Neoptolemus ("new warrior") reflects his arrival late in the war.

## In the Odyssey

[Odysseus](odysseus.md) gives the most favourable account of Neoptolemus, telling the ghost of [Achilles](achilles.md) about his son's deeds at Troy. "It was I that led him up out of Scyros in my good hollow ship, in the wake of the goodly-greaved Achaeans."[^od-scyros]

In council, "he was ever the first to speak, and no word missed the mark; the godlike Nestor and I alone surpassed him." In battle, "he never tarried behind in the throng or the press of men, but ran out far before us all, yielding to none in that might of his. And many men he slew in warfare dread."[^od-prowess]

Odysseus highlights two specific feats: Neoptolemus "smote with the sword that son of Telephus, the hero Eurypylus, and many Ceteians of his company were slain around him." He was "the comeliest man that ever I saw, next to goodly Memnon."[^od-eurypylus]

Inside the wooden horse, Neoptolemus showed extraordinary courage: "never once did I see thy son's fair face wax pale, nor did he wipe the tears from his cheeks: but he besought me often to let him go forth from the horse, and kept handling his sword-hilt, and his heavy bronze-shod spear, and he was set on mischief against the Trojans."[^od-horse]

After Troy's fall, "he embarked unscathed with his share of the spoil, and with a noble prize; he was not smitten with the sharp spear, and got no wound in close fight."[^od-unscathed] Achilles' ghost, hearing this, "passed with great strides along the mead of asphodel, rejoicing in that I had told him of his son's renown."[^od-rejoicing]

## In the Bibliotheca

### Birth

[Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) records that when [Achilles](achilles.md) was hidden at Lycomedes' court on Scyros, "Achilles had an intrigue with Deidamia, daughter of Lycomedes, and a son Pyrrhus was born to him, who was afterwards called Neoptolemus."[^apd-birth]

### Summoned to Troy

After Achilles' death, the seer Helenus was captured and "forced to tell how Ilium could be taken," revealing three conditions: "first, if the bones of Pelops were brought to them; next, if Neoptolemus fought for them; and third, if the Palladium... were stolen from Troy."[^apd-conditions]

Odysseus and Phoenix went to Scyros and "persuaded him to let Neoptolemus go. On coming to the camp and receiving his father's arms from Ulysses, who willingly resigned them, Neoptolemus slew many of the Trojans."[^apd-arms] He also "slew Eurypylus, son of Telephus," who had "arrived to fight for the Trojans, bringing a great force of Mysians."[^apd-eurypylus]

### The Sack of Troy

During the sack, "Neoptolemus slew Priam, who had taken refuge at the altar of Zeus of the Courtyard."[^apd-priam] In the division of spoils, "Neoptolemus got Andromache."[^apd-spoils]

### After the War

[Thetis](../deities/thetis.md) "persuaded Neoptolemus to wait two days and to offer sacrifice" before departing, saving him from the storm that wrecked many Greek ships.[^apd-thetis] He then "set out for the country of the Molossians by land with Helenus, and on the way Phoenix died, and Neoptolemus buried him; and having vanquished the Molossians in battle he reigned as king and begat Molossus on Andromache."[^apd-molossia]

He gave Helenus his mother Deidamia in marriage, and "when Peleus was expelled from Phthia by the sons of Acastus and died, Neoptolemus succeeded to his father's kingdom."[^apd-phthia]

### Death

"When Orestes went mad, Neoptolemus carried off his wife Hermione, who had previously been betrothed to him in Troy; and for that reason he was slain by Orestes at Delphi."[^apd-death-orestes] Apollodorus adds a variant: "some say that he went to Delphi to demand satisfaction from Apollo for the death of his father, and that he rifled the votive offerings and set fire to the temple, and was on that account slain by Machaereus the Phocian."[^apd-death-delphi]

## In the Aeneid

[Virgil](../sources/aeneid.md) gives the most dramatic account of Neoptolemus at the sack of Troy, narrated by [Aeneas](aeneas.md) himself: "Myself I saw in the gateway Neoptolemus mad in slaughter."[^aen-gateway]

He is introduced with a vivid simile: "right before the vestibule and in the front doorway Pyrrhus moves rejoicingly in the sparkle of arms and gleaming brass: like as when a snake fed on poisonous herbs, whom chill winter kept hid and swollen underground, now fresh from his weeds outworn and shining in youth, wreathes his slippery body into the daylight, his upreared breast meets the sun, and his triple-cloven tongue flickers in his mouth."[^aen-snake]

The killing of Priam is extended into a scene of horror. First Pyrrhus kills Polites, one of Priam's sons, before his parents' eyes. Priam hurls a feeble spear and denounces him: "not such to a foe was the Achilles whose parentage thou beliest; but he revered a suppliant's right and trust, restored to the tomb Hector's pallid corpse, and sent me back to my realm."[^aen-priam-speech] Pyrrhus replies: "thou then shalt tell this, and go with the message to my sire the son of Peleus: remember to tell him of my baleful deeds, and the degeneracy of Neoptolemus. Now die." He "drew him quivering to the very altar, slipping in the pool of his child's blood, and wound his left hand in his hair, while in his right the sword flashed out and plunged to the hilt in his side."[^aen-priam-death]

## In the Posthomerica

The [Posthomerica](../sources/posthomerica.md) gives the most extended account of Neoptolemus at Troy, where he is the dominant Greek warrior from his arrival through the sack of the city.

### Fetched from Scyros

After [Eurypylus](eurypylus.md) drove the Greeks behind their wall, [Calchas](calchas.md) prophesied that only [Achilles](achilles.md)' son could turn the tide. [Odysseus](odysseus.md) and [Diomedes](diomedes.md) sailed to Scyros, where they found Neoptolemus "before his palace-gate, now hurling dart and lance, now in his chariot driving fleetfoot steeds." They gazed on him with reverence, "for that goodly form and face seemed even as very Achilles unto them."[^post-scyros]

Odysseus promised him his father's divine arms and [Hermione](hermione.md)'s hand. Neoptolemus agreed at once, but his mother Deidameia — already grief-wasted for Achilles "as when snow from mountain-sides before the sun and east-wind wastes away" — pleaded desperately. She blamed Odysseus and Diomedes for having lured his father to his death and begged him to stay: "He, mightier than thou, mightier than all heroes on earth, yea, and a Goddess' son — but was in battle slain, all through the wiles and crafty counsels of these very men."[^post-deidameia]

Neoptolemus answered simply: "No man is in war beyond his destiny slain. If my weird be to die in my country's cause, then let me die when I have done deeds worthy of my sire." His grandfather Lycomedes warned him of the sea's perils but did not try to hold him. As he departed, Deidameia cast herself on his bed, kissed a dart he left behind, and "whatso else her weeping eyes beheld that was her son's."[^post-departure]

### Arrival and Donning Achilles' Arms

Odysseus deliberately did not point out Achilles' tomb as they passed it, "lest the tide of grief too high should swell within his breast." On arrival, the Greeks were besieged behind their wall by Eurypylus. Diomedes leapt from the ship and rallied them, but Neoptolemus alone showed no fear — "his might was like his father's: lust of war swept o'er him."[^post-arrival]

He donned his father's arms: "in his father's arms Achilles' son clad him and lo, he seemed Achilles' self! Light on his limbs and lapping close they lay — so cunning was Hephaestus' workmanship — which for another had been a giant's arms. The massive helmet cumbered not his brows; yea, the great Pelian spear-shaft burdened not his hand."[^post-arms] Old [Phoenix](phoenix.md) came and "marvelling gazed on one the image of Peleides." Tides of joy and grief swept over him — "he for sheer gladness wept" — and he clasped Neoptolemus, crying: "Thou art wholly like him — yea, I seem to see alive amid the Argives him for whom sharp anguish shrouds me ever."[^post-phoenix]

[Agamemnon](agamemnon.md) greeted him at the feast: "Thou verily art the brave-souled Aeacid's son, his very image thou in stalwart might, in beauty, stature, courage, and in soul." Neoptolemus replied modestly: "Would I might meet him living yet, O King, that so himself might see the son of his love not shaming his great father's name."[^post-agamemnon]

### Duel with Eurypylus

The next morning, Neoptolemus rode forth in [Achilles](achilles.md)' chariot drawn by his immortal horses — "with joy that pair bore battleward their lord, so like to Aeacus' son, their deathless hearts held him no worser than Achilles' self." He rallied the Greeks and fought all day along the wall without tiring, slaying hosts of enemies.[^post-horses]

When he met Eurypylus face to face, they exchanged challenges. Neoptolemus declared his lineage: "Achilles' son am I, son of the man whose long spear smote thy sire." Eurypylus hurled a monstrous stone at his shield, "but, no whit staggered by its whirlwind rush, he like a giant mountain-foreland stood." They fought like terrible lions. At last "the Pelian lance, sped onward by a mighty thrust, hath passed clear through Eurypylus' throat." Neoptolemus stood over the body: "My father's massy spear hath now subdued thee under me, that spear no man shall 'scape."[^post-eurypylus-duel]

He stripped the armour and charged on in his chariot "like a thunderbolt," routing the Trojans into their city. [Ares](../deities/ares.md) himself descended with his four terrible steeds to rally them, and grew wroth enough to confront Neoptolemus directly — but [Athena](../deities/athena.md) swooped from Olympus, and [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) thundered to separate the two gods.[^post-ares]

After the battle, [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md) "from his limbs had charmed all ache of travail, making him as one whom labour had no power to tire."[^post-thetis-charm]

### At Achilles' Tomb

During a truce, Neoptolemus "went forth to his sire's huge tomb. Outpouring tears, he kissed the tall memorial pillar of the dead, and groaning clasped it round." He cried: "Oh to have met thee living mid the host! Then of each other had our souls had joy... Yet, though thou be afar amidst the dead, thy spear, thy son, have made thy foes to quail."[^post-tomb]

### Last Battles from the Walls

In Book XI, Neoptolemus fought before the Idaean Gate with his Myrmidons. When [Aeneas](aeneas.md) and Eurymachus routed the Greeks, Neoptolemus alone rallied the fleeing host: "Cravens, why flee, like starlings nothing-worth scared by a hawk that swoopeth down on them? Come, play the men! Better it is by far to die in war than choose unmanly flight!" His Myrmidons swept after him and the Greeks won breathing-space.[^post-rally]

However, Thetis diverted his rage from Aeneas: "in reverence for [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md), Thetis splendour-veiled turned from that man her mighty son's son's rage and giant strength on other hosts of foes."[^post-thetis-aeneas]

### The Wooden Horse

When [Odysseus](odysseus.md) proposed the stratagem of the Horse, Neoptolemus objected: "Brave men meet face to face their foes! Who skulk behind their walls, and fight from towers, are nidderings, hearts palsied with base fear. Hence with all thought of wile and stratagem! The great war-travail of the spear beseems true heroes." He and [Philoctetes](philoctetes.md) alone refused to submit, "still insatiate for the bitter fray," until Zeus hurled a thunderbolt before them and they "grudgingly obeyed."[^post-horse-protest]

Nestor praised him for offering to enter first: "Thy father's son art thou! Achilles' might and chivalrous speech be here!" Neoptolemus replied: "Gladlier would I fall with glory in fight than flee from Troy, bowed 'neath a load of shame." He entered the Horse first of all the warriors.[^post-horse-entry]

### Sack of Troy

During the sack, Neoptolemus was devastating. He slew three of [Priam](priam.md)'s sons — Pammon, Polites, and Antiphonus — then Agenor, and "hero on hero slew he; everywhere stalked at his side Death's black doom manifest: clad in his sire's might, whomso he met he slew."[^post-sack-kills]

He found old Priam by the altar of Zeus the Hearth-lord. Priam did not flinch but begged for death: "Slay me, and pity not my misery. I have no will to see the sun's light more." He wished Achilles had killed him when he came to ransom [Hector](hector.md): "He spared me — so the Fates had spun my thread of destiny." Neoptolemus answered: "Fain am I, yea, in haste to grant thy prayer. A foe like thee will I not leave alive; for naught is dearer unto men than life." He beheaded the king: "with one stroke swept he off that hoary head lightly as when a reaper lops an ear in a parched cornfield at the harvest-tide."[^post-priam]

### Achilles' Ghost and the Sacrifice of Polyxena

After the sack, Achilles' shade appeared to Neoptolemus in his sleep, in the form he bore in life. The ghost kissed his son's neck and eyes, and gave him counsel: "Be foremost of the Argives ever; yield to none in valour, but in council bow before thine elders." He urged kindness: "humankind are like the flower of grass, the blossom of spring; these fade the while those bloom: therefore be ever kindly with thy kind."[^post-ghost]

But the ghost also demanded [Polyxena](polyxena.md)'s sacrifice at his tomb, threatening to stir up the seas and bar the Greeks' return: "else shall my wrath against them more than for Briseis burn." Then "as a wind-breath swift he fleeted thence, and came to the Elysian Plain, whereto a path to heaven reacheth."[^post-ghost-demand]

Neoptolemus assembled the host and relayed his father's command. A storm immediately confirmed the threat. He led Polyxena to the tomb, laid his hand upon it, and prayed: "Hear, father, thy son's prayer... Lo, unto thee now all thine heart's desire will we fulfil. Be gracious to us thou, and to our praying grant sweet home-return." He then "into the maid's throat plunged the blade of death: the dear life straightway sobbed she forth." The waves were stilled at once.[^post-polyxena]

## In the Fabulae

[Hyginus](../sources/hyginus.md) lists Neoptolemus among the warriors in the wooden horse and notes he "slew 6" Trojans in the war.[^hyg-kills] In the list of combat matchups: "Neoptolemus with Eurypylus; Eurypylus was killed."[^hyg-combat]

## Variant Traditions

The sources agree on Neoptolemus's ferocity at Troy but differ on his fate and character:

- In [Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md), he is killed at Delphi either by [Orestes](orestes.md) (over [Hermione](hermione.md)) or by a Phocian (for desecrating the temple).
- In the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md), he departs Troy unscathed with no mention of a later death.
- [Virgil](../sources/aeneid.md) condemns him through Aeneas's eyes as a savage, while Homer's Odysseus portrays him as admirably brave.

Priam's dying speech in the Aeneid explicitly contrasts Neoptolemus unfavourably with his father — Achilles respected suppliants and returned Hector's body, while Pyrrhus slaughters at the altar. In the [Posthomerica](../sources/posthomerica.md), the scene is somewhat different: Priam does not rebuke Neoptolemus but actively requests death, and Neoptolemus frames the killing as granting a wish — though the beheading simile ("lightly as when a reaper lops an ear") suggests casual brutality.

The Posthomerica also uniquely portrays Neoptolemus as initially opposed to the Wooden Horse stratagem, preferring open combat — a detail absent from all other sources, which present his entry into the Horse without protest.
