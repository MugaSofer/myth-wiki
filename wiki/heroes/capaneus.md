## Overview

**Capaneus** was a champion of [Argos](../places/argos.md) and one of the [Seven Against Thebes](../events/seven-against-thebes.md). He is remembered for his arrogance—he defied the gods themselves, boasting that not even [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) could stop him. His death, struck by a thunderbolt while scaling the walls of Thebes, became a symbol of the dangers of hubris.

## In the Bibliotheca

Capaneus is introduced as one of the seven leaders mustered by [Adrastus](adrastus.md): "Having mustered an army with seven leaders, Adrastus hastened to wage war on Thebes. The leaders were these: Adrastus, son of Talaus; Amphiaraus, son of Oicles; Capaneus, son of Hipponous."[^apd-leader]

At the gates of Thebes during the siege, "Capaneus was stationed at the Ogygian [gate]."[^apd-gate] His supreme pride and defiance of the gods became his undoing: "And as many fell, Eteocles and Polynices, by the resolution of both armies, fought a single combat for the kingdom, and slew each other... But a battle having taken place, the Cadmeans were chased in a crowd as far as the walls, and Capaneus, seizing a ladder, was climbing up it to the walls, when Zeus smote him with a thunderbolt."[^apd-death]

### His Widow's Sacrifice

His wife Evadne, witnessing his pyre burning, showed exceptional devotion: "And when the pyre of Capaneus was burning, his wife Evadne, the daughter of Iphis, threw herself on the pyre, and was burned with him."[^apd-evadne] Evadne's act of marital fidelity and suicide became legendary, exemplifying the devoted wife in Greek tradition.
