## Overview

**Tantalus** was a son of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) who enjoyed the privilege of dining with the gods but committed a crime against them for which he was punished with eternal torment in the underworld. His punishment became one of the most famous images of [Hades](../deities/hades.md), and his name gives English the word "tantalize."

## In the Odyssey

[Odysseus](odysseus.md) sees Tantalus during his visit to the land of the dead: "Moreover I beheld Tantalus in grievous torment, standing in a mere and the water came nigh unto his chin. And he stood straining as one athirst, but he might not attain to the water to drink of it. For often as that old man stooped down in his eagerness to drink, so often the water was swallowed up and it vanished away, and the black earth still showed at his feet, for some god parched it evermore."[^od11-tantalus]

The fruit trees above him are equally tormenting: "And tall trees flowering shed their fruit overhead, pears and pomegranates and apple trees with bright fruit, and sweet figs and olives in their bloom, whereat when that old man reached out his hands to clutch them, the wind would toss them to the shadowy clouds."[^od11-trees]

[^od11-tantalus]: "Moreover I beheld Tantalus in grievous torment, standing in a mere and the water came nigh unto his chin. And he stood straining as one athirst, but he might not attain to the water to drink of it. For often as that old man stooped down in his eagerness to drink, so often the water was swallowed up and it vanished away, and the black earth still showed at his feet, for some god parched it evermore" (Odyssey 11.582-592, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od11-trees]: "And tall trees flowering shed their fruit overhead, pears and pomegranates and apple trees with bright fruit, and sweet figs and olives in their bloom, whereat when that old man reached out his hands to clutch them, the wind would toss them to the shadowy clouds" (Odyssey 11.588-592, trans. Butcher and Lang)

## In the Bibliotheca

Apollodorus describes a different form of punishment: "Tantalus is punished in Hades by having a stone impending over him, by being perpetually in a lake and seeing at his shoulders on either side trees with fruit growing beside the lake. The water touches his jaws, but when he would take a draught of it, the water dries up; and when he would partake of the fruits, the trees with the fruits are lifted by winds as high as the clouds."[^apd-punishment]

Apollodorus also gives two explanations for his crime: "Some say that he is thus punished because he blabbed to men the mysteries of the gods, and because he attempted to share ambrosia with his fellows."[^apd-crime]

Tantalus is listed among the kings of the Achaeans, with [Pelops](pelops.md) as his son and successor.[^apd-lineage]

[^apd-punishment]: "Tantalus is punished in Hades by having a stone impending over him, by being perpetually in a lake and seeing at his shoulders on either side trees with fruit growing beside the lake. The water touches his jaws, but when he would take a draught of it, the water dries up; and when he would partake of the fruits, the trees with the fruits are lifted by winds as high as the clouds" (Bibliotheca E.2.1, trans.

## In the Fabulae

Hyginus provides additional detail about Tantalus's crime — the infamous banquet. "When Pelops, son of Tantalus and Dione, daughter of Atlas, had been slain and cut up by Tantalus at a feast of the gods, Ceres ate his arm, but he was given life again by the will of the gods. When his other limbs were joined together as they had been, but the shoulder was not complete, Ceres fitted an ivory one in its place."[^hyg83-banquet]

Hyginus also lists Tantalus among "those who ate the flesh of their children at banquets" alongside Thyestes and others.[^hyg246-list]

[^hyg83-banquet]: "When Pelops, son of Tantalus and Dione, daughter of Atlas, had been slain and cut up by Tantalus at a feast of the gods, Ceres ate his arm, but he was given life again by the will of the gods. When his other limbs were joined together as they had been, but the shoulder was not complete, Ceres fitted an ivory one in its place" (Fabulae §83, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg246-list]: Fabulae §246, trans. Mary Grant

## In the Metamorphoses

Ovid references Tantalus's punishment briefly: "O Tantalus, thou canst not touch the wave."[^met4-tantalus] He also appears through his descendants, particularly his daughter Niobe, who boasts of her father's divine connections: "Tantalus was my father, who alone was admitted to the table of the gods."[^met6-niobe]

[^met4-tantalus]: "O Tantalus, thou canst not touch the wave" (Metamorphoses 4.458, trans. H.T. Riley)
[^met6-niobe]: "Tantalus was my father, who alone was admitted to the table of the gods" (Metamorphoses 6.172-173, trans. H.T. Riley)

## Variant Traditions

### The Crime

Sources disagree on why Tantalus was punished:
- **Revealing divine secrets** and **sharing ambrosia** with mortals (Bibliotheca E.2.1)
- **Serving his son [Pelops](pelops.md) as a meal** to the gods (Fabulae §83)
- The [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) describes only the punishment, not the crime

### The Punishment

The punishment also varies:
- **Water and fruit receding** when he reaches for them ([Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) 11, [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) E.2.1)
- **A stone impending over him** in addition to the water and fruit (Bibliotheca E.2.1 only)
