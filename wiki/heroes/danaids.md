## Overview

**The Danaids** were the fifty daughters of [Danaus](danaus.md), descendants of [Io](io.md) through Epaphus and Libya. When the sons of Aegyptus sought to marry them by force, the Danaids fled Egypt with their father and found asylum in [Argos](../places/argos.md). On the wedding night, all but one murdered their bridegrooms and were purified of their crime by divine decree.

## In the Bibliotheca

### The Forced Marriage and Flight

[Danaus](danaus.md) and the fifty sons of Aegyptus, both descendants of Belus, quarreled over the kingdom. "Danaus feared the sons of Egyptus, and by the advice of Athena he built a ship, being the first to do so, and having put his daughters on board he fled."[^apd-flight] The Danaids came to [Argos](../places/argos.md), where "Danaus sent his daughters to draw water" because [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) had dried up the land's springs in anger at [Inachus](inachus.md).[^apd-water]

### The Marriage Lottery and Murder

The sons of Aegyptus pursued their cousins to [Argos](../places/argos.md) and "exhorted Danaus to lay aside his enmity, and begged to marry his daughters."[^apd-pursuit] Although [Danaus](danaus.md) "distrusted their professions and bore them a grudge on account of his exile," he consented and allotted the Danaids among them.[^apd-consent] The marriages were arranged by lottery: "When they had got their brides by lot, Danaus made a feast and gave his daughters daggers; and they slew their bridegrooms as they slept, all but Hypermnestra; for she saved Lynceus because he had respected her virginity: wherefore Danaus shut her up and kept her under ward."[^apd-murder]

Only one Danaid refused to murder her husband: Hypermnestra spared Lynceus. Her act of mercy would reverse the Danaids' fate, as Lynceus survived to become king of [Argos](../places/argos.md) and father of the royal line through which [Heracles](heracles.md) would be born.

### Purification and Aftermath

"The rest of the daughters of Danaus buried the heads of their bridegrooms in Lerna and paid funeral honors to their bodies in front of the city; and Athena and Hermes purified them at the command of Zeus."[^apd-purification] After their cleansing, "Danaus... bestowed his other daughters on the victors in an athletic contest."[^apd-contest]

## In Aeschylus' Suppliant Maidens

The Danaids appear as the Chorus throughout [Aeschylus'](../sources/aeschylus-suppliant-maidens.md) play, which depicts their arrival in [Argos](../places/argos.md) as suppliants fleeing the sons of Aegyptus. They trace their ancestry from [Io](io.md): "From Epaphus sprang Libya, and from Libya, Belus; and from Belus, Aegyptus and Danaus."[^sm-genealogy]

The Danaids invoke [Io](io.md), their ancestress, as they approach the altar: "Io, the ox-horned maiden, whom, After long wandering, woe, and scathe, Zeus with a touch, a mystic breath, Made mother of our name."[^sm-io] They appeal to the spirits of the land: "City, and land, and waters wan Of Inachus, and gods most high... Receive ye us—keep watch and ward Above the suppliant maiden band!"[^sm-appeal]

When the Herald of Aegyptus arrives with threats to drag them from the altar by force, the Danaids beg the King of [Argos](../places/argos.md) for protection: "nor, when ye speak, be voluble nor eager — they that dwell within this land are sternly swift to chide."[^sm-appeal2] The Argives vote unanimously to grant them asylum and defend them against their pursuers.

## Variant Traditions

The story of the Danaids presents an interesting case of divine judgment on a mass killing. Though the Danaids murdered fifty men—their cousins and bridegrooms—they were purified by divine will at Zeus' command, with [Athena](../deities/athena.md) and [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md) performing the rite. The sources do not explain the theological basis for this purification, but it reflects a principle that killing in self-defense against attempted rape was justified and not subject to the usual pollution of murder.

Hypermnestra, who refused to participate in the murder, was imprisoned by [Danaus](danaus.md) for her disobedience but was ultimately vindicated: she became queen of [Argos](../places/argos.md) through her husband Lynceus, and it was through her line that the greatest heroes—including [Perseus](perseus.md) and [Heracles](heracles.md)—were born.
