## Overview

**Menelaus** is the king of Sparta and husband of [Helen](helen.md), whose abduction by Paris sparked the Trojan War. He is the brother of [Agamemnon](agamemnon.md) and son-in-law of Tyndareus. After long wanderings following the war, he was made immortal by [Hera](../deities/hera.md) and sent to the Elysian Fields.

## In the Bibliotheca

### Marriage to Helen (3.10.8-9)

When the kings of Greece came to Sparta to woo [Helen](helen.md), [Odysseus](odysseus.md) devised the oath that would bind all suitors to defend the chosen bridegroom. "Tyndareus put the suitors on their oath, and while he chose Menelaus to be the bridegroom of Helen, he solicited Icarius to bestow Penelope on Ulysses."[^apd-marriage]

"Menelaus had by Helen a daughter Hermione."[^apd-hermione] Tyndareus "ceded the kingdom to him."[^apd-kingdom]

### The Abduction and the Oath (E.3.3, E.3.6)

Paris "was entertained by Menelaus; but on the tenth day, Menelaus having gone on a journey to Crete to perform the obsequies of his mother's father Catreus, Alexander persuaded Helen to go off with him."[^apd-abduction]

"When Menelaus was aware of the rape, he came to [Agamemnon](agamemnon.md) at Mycenae, and begged him to muster an army against Troy and to raise levies in Greece." Agamemnon reminded the former suitors of their oaths.[^apd-muster]

### The War (E.4.1-2)

Paris "fought a single combat with Menelaus; and when Alexander got the worst of it, [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md) carried him off."[^apd-duel] Menelaus was then wounded by Pandarus, who "by shooting an arrow at Menelaus, broke the truce."[^apd-wound]

### The Returns (E.6.1, E.6.29)

After the fall of Troy, Menelaus quarrelled with [Agamemnon](agamemnon.md) — "Menelaus advising that they should sail away, and Agamemnon insisting that they should stay and sacrifice to [Athena](../deities/athena.md)." Menelaus sailed but "was overtaken by a storm, and after losing the rest of his vessels, arrived with five ships in Egypt."[^apd-storm]

"After wandering for eight years he came to port at Mycenae, and there found [Orestes](orestes.md), who had avenged his father's murder. And having come to Sparta he regained his own kingdom, and being made immortal by [Hera](../deities/hera.md) he went to the Elysian Fields with Helen."[^apd-return]

> **VARIANT:** "According to some, he discovered Helen at the court of Proteus, king of Egypt; for till then Menelaus had only a phantom of her made of clouds."[^apd-phantom]

## In the Odyssey

In [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) Book IV, Menelaus tells Telemachus of his wanderings and encounter with Proteus in Egypt. Proteus prophesied: "thou shalt not die and meet thy fate in Argos... but the deathless gods will convey thee to the Elysian plain... where life is easiest for men... for thou hast Helen to wife, and thereby they deem thee to be son of Zeus."

## In the Fabulae

### Marriage to Helen (§78)

Tyndareus feared that discord might arise among [Helen](helen.md)'s suitors, and "at the advice of [Ulysses](odysseus.md) bound himself by an oath, and gave Helen leave to put a wreath on whomever she wished to marry. She put it on Menelaus, and Tyndareus gave her to him in marriage and at his death left him his kingdom."[^hyg-78]

### The Abduction (§92)

[Paris](paris.md), at the prompting of [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md), "took Helen from his host Menelaus from Lacedemon to Troy, and married her."[^hyg-92] Helen took with her "two handmaids, Aethra and Thisiadie, captives, but once queens, whom [Castor and Pollux](../heroes/dioscuri.md) had assigned to her."[^hyg-92-maids]

### Proteus in Egypt (§118)

After Troy's fall, Menelaus reached Egypt and encountered Proteus, "the prophetic Old Man of the Sea... who used to change himself into all sorts of shapes. By the advice of his daughter Idothea, Menelaus bound him with a chain, so that he would tell him when he would reach home."[^hyg-118-proteus]

Proteus revealed that "the gods were angry because Troy had been taken, and on that account an offering should be made which the Greeks call hekatombe, a hundred animals being slain. And so Menelaus offered a hekatombe. Then at length, the eighth year after he left Troy, he returned home with Helen."[^hyg-118-hekatombe]
