## Overview

**Menelaus** is the king of Sparta and husband of [Helen](helen.md), whose abduction by Paris sparked the Trojan War. He is the brother of [Agamemnon](agamemnon.md) and son-in-law of Tyndareus. After long wanderings following the war, he was made immortal by [Hera](../deities/hera.md) and sent to the Elysian Fields.

## In the Bibliotheca

### Marriage to Helen (3.10.8-9)

When the kings of Greece came to Sparta to woo [Helen](helen.md), [Odysseus](odysseus.md) devised the oath that would bind all suitors to defend the chosen bridegroom. "Tyndareus put the suitors on their oath, and while he chose Menelaus to be the bridegroom of Helen, he solicited Icarius to bestow Penelope on Ulysses."[^apd-marriage]

"Menelaus had by Helen a daughter Hermione."[^apd-hermione] Tyndareus "ceded the kingdom to him."[^apd-kingdom]

### The Abduction and the Oath (E.3.3, E.3.6)

Paris "was entertained by Menelaus; but on the tenth day, Menelaus having gone on a journey to Crete to perform the obsequies of his mother's father Catreus, Alexander persuaded Helen to go off with him."[^apd-abduction]

"When Menelaus was aware of the rape, he came to [Agamemnon](agamemnon.md) at Mycenae, and begged him to muster an army against Troy and to raise levies in Greece." Agamemnon reminded the former suitors of their oaths.[^apd-muster]

### The War (E.4.1-2)

Paris "fought a single combat with Menelaus; and when Alexander got the worst of it, [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md) carried him off."[^apd-duel] Menelaus was then wounded by Pandarus, who "by shooting an arrow at Menelaus, broke the truce."[^apd-wound]

### The Returns (E.6.1, E.6.29)

After the fall of Troy, Menelaus quarrelled with [Agamemnon](agamemnon.md) — "Menelaus advising that they should sail away, and Agamemnon insisting that they should stay and sacrifice to [Athena](../deities/athena.md)." Menelaus sailed but "was overtaken by a storm, and after losing the rest of his vessels, arrived with five ships in Egypt."[^apd-storm]

"After wandering for eight years he came to port at Mycenae, and there found [Orestes](orestes.md), who had avenged his father's murder. And having come to Sparta he regained his own kingdom, and being made immortal by [Hera](../deities/hera.md) he went to the Elysian Fields with Helen."[^apd-return]

> **VARIANT:** "According to some, he discovered Helen at the court of Proteus, king of Egypt; for till then Menelaus had only a phantom of her made of clouds."[^apd-phantom]

## In the Odyssey

In [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) Book IV, Menelaus tells Telemachus of his wanderings and encounter with Proteus in Egypt. Proteus prophesied: "thou shalt not die and meet thy fate in Argos... but the deathless gods will convey thee to the Elysian plain... where life is easiest for men... for thou hast Helen to wife, and thereby they deem thee to be son of Zeus."

## In the Fabulae

### Marriage to Helen (§78)

Tyndareus feared that discord might arise among [Helen](helen.md)'s suitors, and "at the advice of [Ulysses](odysseus.md) bound himself by an oath, and gave Helen leave to put a wreath on whomever she wished to marry. She put it on Menelaus, and Tyndareus gave her to him in marriage and at his death left him his kingdom."[^hyg-78]

### The Abduction (§92)

[Paris](paris.md), at the prompting of [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md), "took Helen from his host Menelaus from Lacedemon to Troy, and married her."[^hyg-92] Helen took with her "two handmaids, Aethra and Thisiadie, captives, but once queens, whom [Castor and Pollux](../heroes/dioscuri.md) had assigned to her."[^hyg-92-maids]

### Proteus in Egypt (§118)

After Troy's fall, Menelaus reached Egypt and encountered Proteus, "the prophetic Old Man of the Sea... who used to change himself into all sorts of shapes. By the advice of his daughter Idothea, Menelaus bound him with a chain, so that he would tell him when he would reach home."[^hyg-118-proteus]

Proteus revealed that "the gods were angry because Troy had been taken, and on that account an offering should be made which the Greeks call hekatombe, a hundred animals being slain. And so Menelaus offered a hekatombe. Then at length, the eighth year after he left Troy, he returned home with Helen."[^hyg-118-hekatombe]

## In the [Posthomerica](../sources/posthomerica.md)

### Testing Greek Resolve (Book VI)

When [Eurypylus](eurypylus.md) arrived with his massive Ceteian host and the Trojan cause seemed to be turning, Menelaus tested the Greeks' resolve by proposing retreat. [Diomedes](diomedes.md) rebuked him sharply, and the Greeks held firm.[^post-test]

### Killing Deiphobus (Book XIII)

During the sack of [Troy](../places/troy.md), Menelaus burst into [Helen](helen.md)'s chamber and "found, heavy with wine, ill-starred [Deiphobus](deiphobus.md), and slew him with the sword." Helen had fled. Menelaus exulted over the corpse: "Dog! I, even I have dealt thee unwelcome death this day!... though thou vaunt thyself spouse of the child of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) the thunder-voiced!" He invoked [Themis](../deities/themis.md)'s justice: "wicked men never elude pure Themis: night and day her eyes are on them." Then he passed on, "dealing merciless death to foes, for maddened was his soul with jealousy."[^post-deiphobus]

### Reunion with Helen (Book XIV)

As the Greeks led the captive Trojan women to the ships, "amidst of these Menelaus led his wife forth of the burning city, having wrought a mighty triumph — joy and shame were his." That night, unable to sleep, "the Cyprian Queen brooded above their souls, that olden love might be renewed, and heart-ache chased away." Helen pleaded her innocence; Menelaus answered: "No more remember past griefs: seal them up hid in thine heart. Let all be locked within the dim dark mansion of forgetfulness." They embraced and clung together "as a vine and ivy entwine their stems."[^post-reunion]

[^post-test]: Posthomerica 6. Menelaus proposes retreat; Diomedes rebukes him.
[^post-deiphobus]: "in Helen's bower found, heavy with wine, ill-starred Deiphobus, and slew him with the sword... Dog! I, even I have dealt thee unwelcome death this day!... wicked men never elude pure Themis: night and day her eyes are on them" (Posthomerica 13.9789-9808, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post-reunion]: "Menelaus led his wife forth of the burning city, having wrought a mighty triumph — joy and shame were his... No more remember past griefs: seal them up hid in thine heart... as a vine and ivy entwine their stems each around other, that no might of wind avails to sever them" (Posthomerica 14.10053-10239)

## In [Sophocles' Ajax](../sources/sophocles-ajax.md)

After [Ajax](ajax.md)'s suicide, Menelaus arrives and forbids burial, declaring Ajax an enemy who must be left unburied as a lesson in obedience to commanders: "No man can himself ordain / His life or death, unless his governor permit."[^soph-aj-menelaus] He maintains that Ajax came to Troy as an ally but behaved as an enemy, and that the army's authority must be upheld.

[Teucer](teucer.md) defies him, arguing that Ajax sailed to Troy as a free commander, not subject to Menelaus's authority. Menelaus and Teucer exchange threats and insults. Ultimately Menelaus is overruled when [Odysseus](odysseus.md) intervenes and persuades [Agamemnon](agamemnon.md) to permit burial.[^soph-aj-menelaus-overruled]

[^soph-aj-menelaus]: "No man can himself ordain / His life or death, unless his governor permit" (Sophocles, Ajax, trans. Lewis Campbell)
[^soph-aj-menelaus-overruled]: Sophocles, Ajax. Menelaus departs after the standoff; Agamemnon then takes up the dispute and is similarly overruled by Odysseus.

## In Euripides' Trojan Women

Menelaus enters the play "a prey to violent and conflicting emotions."[^tw-men-entrance] He announces he has come not for Helen's sake but for Paris, the "cozener / And thief" who ate at his table; now Paris is dead, and he has come to claim Helen. The Greek army has given her to him to kill or keep as he pleases: "The host whose labouring swords / Won her, have given her up to me, to fill / My pleasure; perchance kill her, or not kill, / But lead her home."[^tw-men-claim] He adds, almost to himself, that he has already reconsidered killing her at Troy and decided to take her home for her punishment there.

[Hecuba](hecuba.md) blesses him and urges him to kill Helen, warning only that he must not look at her face, lest she snare him. Helen is brought out by soldiers. Hecuba insists she be allowed to speak in rebuttal — confident that the full case against Helen will secure the death sentence.

After Hecuba's prosecution, Menelaus pronounces judgment: "Thy thought doth walk with mine in one intent. / 'Tis sure; her heart was willing, when she went / Forth to a stranger's bed."[^tw-men-judgment] He orders Helen to go to be stoned. But Helen kneels and clasps his knees, and his resolve immediately falters — he puts her on a separate ship rather than executing her on the spot. Hecuba warns: "A lover once, will alway love again."[^tw-lover-men] Menelaus insists that if what he loved is evil, he will hate it — but concedes the separate ship.
