## Overview

**Silenus** is the aged father of the Satyrs and a devoted companion of [Dionysus](../deities/dionysus.md). In Euripides' [Cyclops](../sources/euripides-cyclops.md), he is enslaved by Polyphemus in Sicily, where he tends the Cyclops's flocks while longing for his god. He is characterised by his love of wine, his cowardice, his comic dishonesty, and his deep attachment to Bacchus.

## In Euripides' [Cyclops](../sources/euripides-cyclops.md)

### Backstory and Enslavement

Silenus explains in the prologue how he came to be enslaved. He had fought beside Dionysus in the war against the Giants, standing at the god's right hand and striking Enceladus with his spear. When Dionysus was later kidnapped by Tyrrhenian pirates, Silenus and his sons sailed to rescue him, but a storm drove them to Sicily — "Mount Ætna's promontory" — where the [Cyclopes](../creatures/cyclopes.md), one-eyed sons of [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md), captured them.[^eur-cyc-sil-prologue]

He now serves as Polyphemus's housekeeper, tending the cave and preparing meals, while his sons herd the flocks on the mountains. He laments his separation from Dionysus and the Bacchic revels.

### Trading and Wine

When [Odysseus](odysseus.md) arrives seeking provisions, Silenus eagerly offers to trade Polyphemus's cheese, lambs, and milk for wine — goods that are not his to sell. On tasting the wine he is overwhelmed: "a perfume exquisitely sweet" — and dances, declaring "shall I not drink just one cup? as it drinks, it winks at me, it beckons me."[^eur-cyc-sil-taste]

### Lies and Comic Business

When Polyphemus returns, Silenus immediately betrays [Odysseus](odysseus.md), lying that the strangers attacked him and stole the food by force. The Chorus contradicts him, but Silenus swears falsehoods by Poseidon, his own sons, and the gods. During the later drinking scene, Silenus serves as Polyphemus's cupbearer but keeps sneaking drinks himself. He claims "the gentle Bacchus gave that kiss, because I look so blooming" and insists on tasting the wine to check its mixture.[^eur-cyc-sil-kiss]

### Fate

When Polyphemus becomes drunk and declares he would not kiss all the Graces because "Ganymede himself appears in matchless beauty," he seizes Silenus as his "Ganymede" and drags him into the cave. Silenus cries: "Ruin awaits me... I from this sleep shall soon behold the most accursed effects."[^eur-cyc-sil-ganymede]

## In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md)

[Ovid](../sources/metamorphoses.md) refers to Silenus in the story of [Midas](midas.md). Bacchus's foster-father Silenus was found wandering drunkenly by Phrygian peasants, who bound him with garlands and brought him to King Midas. Midas, an initiate of the Bacchic rites, recognised and entertained him for ten days before returning him to Dionysus. In gratitude, the god granted Midas the golden touch.[^met-sil-midas]
