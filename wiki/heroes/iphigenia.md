## Overview

**Iphigenia** was the eldest daughter of [Agamemnon](agamemnon.md) and [Clytemnestra](clytemnestra.md). When the Greek fleet was becalmed at Aulis, the seer [Calchas](calchas.md) declared that [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md) demanded her sacrifice. She was lured to Aulis under the pretext of marriage to [Achilles](achilles.md), but at the moment of sacrifice, the goddess snatched her away and substituted a deer. Multiple sources report she was transported to the land of the Taurians and made Artemis's priestess.

## In the Epic Cycle

In the Cypria, Artemis was angry at [Agamemnon](agamemnon.md)'s boast and sent adverse winds. When told to sacrifice Iphigenia, the goddess "snatched her away and transported her to the Tauri, making her immortal, and putting a stag in place of the girl upon the altar."[^cyp-iph]

## In the Bibliotheca

[Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) records that Artemis demanded the sacrifice both because Agamemnon "had said, 'Artemis herself could not (do it better)'" when shooting a deer, and because Atreus had failed to sacrifice the golden lamb to her. Agamemnon sent for Iphigenia "on the pretence that he had promised to give her to Achilles as a wife in reward for his military service." At the altar, "Artemis carried her off to the Taurians and appointed her to be her priestess, substituting a deer for her at the altar; but some say that Artemis made her immortal."[^apd-iph]

## In the Fabulae

[Hyginus](../sources/hyginus.md) records that a storm kept the fleet at Aulis because Agamemnon had wounded Artemis's deer and spoken haughtily. Calchas declared only Iphigenia's sacrifice would appease the goddess. [Odysseus](odysseus.md) brought her to Aulis with the false promise of marriage to Achilles. At the altar, "Diana pitied the girl, cast a mist over her and substituted a deer for her, and bore her through the clouds to the land of Tauris."[^hyg-iph]

## In Iphigenia in Aulis

In [Euripides](../sources/euripides-iphigenia-aulis.md), Iphigenia is brought to Aulis by her mother [Clytemnestra](clytemnestra.md), believing she is to marry [Achilles](achilles.md). She is an affectionate daughter who rushes to embrace her father: "joyous do I behold thee after a long season."[^eur-ia-joy]

When the truth is revealed, she first pleads for her life in a powerful supplication: "If, O father, I possessed the eloquence of Orpheus, that I might charm by persuasion, so that rocks should follow me... But now I will offer tears as all my skill." She reminds him of their past intimacy — how she first called him father, how he spoke of seeing her married — and appeals: "This light of heaven is sweetest of things for men to behold, but that below is naught; and mad is he who seeks to die."[^eur-ia-plea]

But after learning that the entire army demands her death and even [Achilles](achilles.md)'s Myrmidons have turned against them, Iphigenia reverses her plea and volunteers to die: "I have determined to die, and this I would fain do gloriously... Greece, the greatest of cities, is now all looking upon me, and there rests in me both the passage of the ships and the destruction of Troy."[^eur-ia-sacrifice] She declares "I give my body for Greece. Sacrifice it, and sack Troy. For this for a long time will be my memorial, and this my children, my wedding, and my glory."[^eur-ia-glory]

She bids farewell to her mother and infant brother [Orestes](orestes.md), asking Clytemnestra not to mourn or wear black: "The altar of the Goddess, daughter of Jove, will be my memorial."[^eur-ia-memorial] She refuses Achilles' further offers of protection: "do not thou, O stranger, die in my behalf, nor slay any one. But let me preserve Greece, if I am able."[^eur-ia-refuse]

At the sacrifice, she presented her neck in silence. But "every one could clearly perceive the sound of the blow, but beheld not the virgin, where on earth she had vanished." A great stag appeared in her place, "of mighty size to see and beautiful in appearance." The messenger reports: "Thy child has evidently flown to the Gods."[^eur-ia-vanish] Agamemnon confirms she "really possesses a companionship with the Gods."[^eur-ia-gods]
