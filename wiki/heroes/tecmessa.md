## Overview

**Tecmessa** is a Phrygian woman of noble birth who was taken captive by [Ajax](ajax.md) son of Telamon during the Trojan War and became his captive-wife. She is a major speaking character in Sophocles' Ajax, where she narrates the events of the night, pleads with Ajax not to kill himself, and afterwards discovers and covers his body.

## In Sophocles' Ajax

### Origin and Status

Tecmessa is identified as a captive from a noble Phrygian family. She lives in Ajax's tent and has borne him a son, Eurysakes. Her situation is entirely dependent on Ajax: "I who in thy home have grown to love thee."[^soph-aj-love] She makes explicit her total dependency — if Ajax dies, she will have no protector and will be divided among the Greeks as a slave.

### Narrating the Night's Events

Tecmessa describes to the chorus of Salaminian sailors what happened in the night. [Ajax](ajax.md) went out armed in the darkness, contrary to his usual habit. He returned dragging sheep and cattle into the tent and tortured them, believing them to be his enemies — "some he beheaded; some, wrenching back the throat, he cleft in twain; others, bound as they were, he kept assailing, wreaking on the cattle his wrath, as if they had been men."[^soph-aj-slaughter] He took one ram, lashed it to a tent-pole, and beat it with a horse-rein, cursing it as if it were [Odysseus](odysseus.md).[^soph-aj-ram] Then suddenly he came to his senses, surrounded by the slaughtered animals, and sat motionless in shock.

### Pleading with Ajax

When Ajax emerges from the tent, lucid and devastated by what he has done, Tecmessa pleads with him not to kill himself. She reminds him that she has no family or home to return to — her father and all her kin are dead — and that if he dies she will be taken by his enemies as a slave along with their son Eurysakes.[^soph-aj-plea] She argues that gratitude alone should restrain him: "bethink thee of thy father, / Bethink thee of thy mother... and of thy child."[^soph-aj-child]

Ajax is moved by the mention of Eurysakes but does not relent. He calls the boy out, presents him with his great shield, and tells Teucer to take care of him.

### Discovering the Body

After Ajax's suicide, Tecmessa discovers the body on the seashore. She covers it with her cloak before [Teucer](teucer.md) arrives.[^soph-aj-cover]

### Arranging Eurysakes as Suppliant

Teucer and Tecmessa together arrange young Eurysakes over the body as a suppliant, with locks of hair placed in his hands. Tecmessa kneels beside the child and the body.[^soph-aj-suppliant]

## In the Posthomerica

### After Ajax's Death (Book V)

In the Posthomerica, Tecmessa wails over [Ajax](ajax.md)'s body. Quintus records her lament: "All thine heart was kindness unto me the hapless, and thou madest me thy wife... thou promisedst to throne me queen of fair-towered Salamis."[^post-lament] [Agamemnon](agamemnon.md) promises to protect her and their son Eurysakes after Ajax's death.[^post-agamemnon]
