# Cadmus

Founder of **[Thebes](../places/thebes.md)**, son of Agenor and Telephassa. Cadmus came from Phoenicia in search of his sister Europa, and on the oracle's advice followed a cow to the site of Thebes.

## In the Bibliotheca (3.1.1, 3.4.1-3.5.4)

### The Search for Europa

When **[Zeus](../deities/zeus.md)** carried off Europa to Crete, her father Agenor sent his sons in search of her, telling them not to return without her. Cadmus and his mother Telephassa settled in Thrace; his brothers Phoenix and Cilix settled elsewhere and gave up the search.[^apd-cadmus-search]

### Founding Thebes

After Telephassa died, Cadmus went to Delphi to inquire about Europa. The god told him to abandon the search and instead follow a cow, founding a city wherever she lay down from weariness. He followed the cow through Phocis and Boeotia until it sank down where Thebes now stands.[^apd-cadmus-cow]

Wishing to sacrifice the cow to **[Athena](../deities/athena.md)**, he sent companions to draw water from the spring of **[Ares](../deities/ares.md)**. A dragon guarding the spring destroyed most of them. Cadmus killed the dragon in indignation, and by Athena's advice sowed its teeth. Armed men called the Sparti rose from the ground and slew each other — though Pherecydes says Cadmus flung stones among them and they fought in confusion. Five survived: Echion, Udaeus, Chthonius, Hyperenor, and Pelorus.[^apd-cadmus-sparti]

### Servitude and Marriage

To atone for killing the dragon, Cadmus served Ares for "an eternal year" — then equivalent to eight of our years.[^apd-cadmus-service] Afterwards Athena procured him the kingdom, and Zeus gave him Harmonia, daughter of **[Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md)** and Ares, as wife. All the gods came down from Olympus to celebrate the marriage with hymns. Cadmus gave Harmonia a robe and a necklace wrought by **[Hephaestus](../deities/hephaestus.md)** — though some say the necklace was given by Europa, who had received it from Zeus.[^apd-cadmus-marriage]

### Children and Fate

To Cadmus and Harmonia were born daughters Autonoe, Ino, Semele, and Agave, and a son Polydorus.[^apd-cadmus-children] Through Semele, Zeus fathered **[Dionysus](../deities/dionysus.md)**; through Agave and Echion came Pentheus.

When Cadmus and Harmonia later quit Thebes, they went to the Encheleans, who were being attacked by the Illyrians. An oracle declared the Encheleans would prevail with Cadmus and Harmonia as their leaders. They believed it, made them commanders, and won. Cadmus reigned over the Illyrians and had a son Illyrius. But afterwards he and Harmonia were turned into serpents and sent by Zeus to the Elysian Fields.[^apd-cadmus-serpent]

## In the Fabulae

The [Fabulae](../sources/hyginus.md) provides two accounts of Cadmus — one emphasizing his transformation, the other the founding of Thebes.

### Transformation into Serpents (§6)

"Cadmus, son of Agenor and Argiope, along with Harmonia his wife, daughter of Venus and Mars, after their children had been killed, were turned into snakes in the region of Illyria by the wrath of Mars, because Cadmus had slain the dragon, guardian of the fountain of Castalia."[^hyg-6-serpents]

The Fabulae attributes the serpent transformation specifically to [Ares](../deities/ares.md)' (Mars') wrath over the dragon's death, connecting it to the fountain of Castalia. This differs from the Bibliotheca, which presents the transformation neutrally and says they were "sent by Zeus to the Elysian Fields."

### The Founding of Thebes (§178)

In a longer section on Europa, the Fabulae narrates Cadmus's quest and the founding of Thebes.

#### The Search for Europa

"Europa was the daughter of Argiope and Agenor, a Sidonian. Jupiter, changing his form to that of a bull, carried her from Sidon to Crete, and begat by her Minos, Sarpedon, and Rhadamanthus."[^hyg-178-europa]

"Her father Agenor sent his sons to bring their sister back, or else not to return to his sight."[^hyg-178-search] The brothers dispersed: "Phoenix set out for Africa, and there remained. From this the Africans are called Phoenicians. Cilix from his own name gave the name to Cilicia."[^hyg-178-brothers]

#### The Oracle and the Cow

"Cadmus in his wanderings came to Delphi. There the oracle told him to buy from farmers an ox which had a moon-shaped mark on its side, and to drive it before him. Where it lay down it was fated that he found a town and rule."[^hyg-178-oracle] The moon-shaped mark is a detail not in the Bibliotheca.

"When Cadmus heard the oracle, he did as he was told."[^hyg-178-obey]

#### The Dragon of Castalia

"While seeking water he came to the fountain of Castalia, which a dragon, the offspring of Mars, was guarding. It killed the comrades of Cadmus, but was killed by Cadmus with a stone."[^hyg-178-dragon] This specifies the weapon (a stone) and names the spring as Castalia.

#### The Sparti

"Under Minerva's instructions he sowed the teeth and ploughed them under. From them sprang the Sparti. These fought themselves, but from them five survived, namely, Chthonius, Udaeus, Hyperenor, Pelorus, and Echion."[^hyg-178-sparti]

#### Etymology

"Moreover, Boeotia was named from the ox Cadmus followed."[^hyg-178-boeotia] This provides the folk etymology connecting Boeotia to the Greek word for ox (bous).
