# Cadmus

Founder of **[Thebes](../places/thebes.md)**, son of Agenor and Telephassa. Cadmus came from Phoenicia in search of his sister Europa, and on the oracle's advice followed a cow to the site of Thebes.

## In the [Argonautica](../sources/argonautica.md)

### The Dragon's Teeth

The Argonautica explains the origin of the dragon's teeth that Aeetes made Jason sow. They were "the fell teeth of the Aonian dragon which Cadmus found in Ogygian Thebes when he came seeking for Europa and there slew the warder of the spring of Ares."[^arg-cadmus-teeth] [Athena](../deities/athena.md) had divided the teeth: half were given to [Aeetes](../heroes/aeetes.md), half to Cadmus himself.

### Tomb of Cadmus and Harmonia in Illyria

The Argonautica also notes a tomb of Cadmus and Harmonia in Illyria, in the land where some Colchians settled after failing to capture [Medea](../heroes/medea.md). The Colchian settlers built their homes "where is the tomb of Harmonia and Cadmus, dwelling among the Encheleans."[^arg-cadmus-tomb]

[^arg-cadmus-teeth]: "the fell teeth of the Aonian dragon which Cadmus found in Ogygian Thebes when he came seeking for Europa and there slew the warder of the spring of Ares" (Argonautica 3.1176-1179, trans. R.C. Seaton)
[^arg-cadmus-tomb]: "where is the tomb of Harmonia and Cadmus, dwelling among the Encheleans" (Argonautica 4.516-518, trans. R.C. Seaton)

## In the Bibliotheca (3.1.1, 3.4.1-3.5.4)

### The Search for Europa

When **[Zeus](../deities/zeus.md)** carried off Europa to Crete, her father Agenor sent his sons in search of her, telling them not to return without her. Cadmus and his mother Telephassa settled in Thrace; his brothers Phoenix and Cilix settled elsewhere and gave up the search.[^apd-cadmus-search]

### Founding Thebes

After Telephassa died, Cadmus went to Delphi to inquire about Europa. The god told him to abandon the search and instead follow a cow, founding a city wherever she lay down from weariness. He followed the cow through Phocis and Boeotia until it sank down where Thebes now stands.[^apd-cadmus-cow]

Wishing to sacrifice the cow to **[Athena](../deities/athena.md)**, he sent companions to draw water from the spring of **[Ares](../deities/ares.md)**. A dragon guarding the spring destroyed most of them. Cadmus killed the dragon in indignation, and by Athena's advice sowed its teeth. Armed men called the Sparti rose from the ground and slew each other — though Pherecydes says Cadmus flung stones among them and they fought in confusion. Five survived: Echion, Udaeus, Chthonius, Hyperenor, and Pelorus.[^apd-cadmus-sparti]

### Servitude and Marriage

To atone for killing the dragon, Cadmus served Ares for "an eternal year" — then equivalent to eight of our years.[^apd-cadmus-service] Afterwards Athena procured him the kingdom, and Zeus gave him Harmonia, daughter of **[Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md)** and Ares, as wife. All the gods came down from Olympus to celebrate the marriage with hymns. Cadmus gave Harmonia a robe and a necklace wrought by **[Hephaestus](../deities/hephaestus.md)** — though some say the necklace was given by Europa, who had received it from Zeus.[^apd-cadmus-marriage]

### Children and Fate

To Cadmus and Harmonia were born daughters Autonoe, Ino, Semele, and Agave, and a son Polydorus.[^apd-cadmus-children] Through Semele, Zeus fathered **[Dionysus](../deities/dionysus.md)**; through Agave and Echion came Pentheus.

When Cadmus and Harmonia later quit Thebes, they went to the Encheleans, who were being attacked by the Illyrians. An oracle declared the Encheleans would prevail with Cadmus and Harmonia as their leaders. They believed it, made them commanders, and won. Cadmus reigned over the Illyrians and had a son Illyrius. But afterwards he and Harmonia were turned into serpents and sent by Zeus to the Elysian Fields.[^apd-cadmus-serpent]

## Appearance

The [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md) gives the only physical description of Cadmus in the sources, as he prepares to fight the dragon of Mars: "Clothed in a skin torn from a lion, he was armed, complete, with lance of glittering steel; and with a dart: but passing these he had a dauntless soul."[^met-cad-appearance]

[^met-cad-appearance]: "Clothed in a skin torn from a lion, he was armed, complete, with lance of glittering steel; and with a dart: but passing these he had a dauntless soul" (Metamorphoses 3.50-53, trans. Brookes More)

## In the Fabulae

The [Fabulae](../sources/hyginus.md) provides two accounts of Cadmus — one emphasizing his transformation, the other the founding of Thebes.

### Transformation into Serpents (§6)

"Cadmus, son of Agenor and Argiope, along with Harmonia his wife, daughter of Venus and Mars, after their children had been killed, were turned into snakes in the region of Illyria by the wrath of Mars, because Cadmus had slain the dragon, guardian of the fountain of Castalia."[^hyg-6-serpents]

The Fabulae attributes the serpent transformation specifically to [Ares](../deities/ares.md)' (Mars') wrath over the dragon's death, connecting it to the fountain of Castalia. This differs from the Bibliotheca, which presents the transformation neutrally and says they were "sent by Zeus to the Elysian Fields."

### The Founding of Thebes (§178)

In a longer section on Europa, the Fabulae narrates Cadmus's quest and the founding of Thebes.

#### The Search for Europa

"Europa was the daughter of Argiope and Agenor, a Sidonian. Jupiter, changing his form to that of a bull, carried her from Sidon to Crete, and begat by her Minos, Sarpedon, and Rhadamanthus."[^hyg-178-europa]

"Her father Agenor sent his sons to bring their sister back, or else not to return to his sight."[^hyg-178-search] The brothers dispersed: "Phoenix set out for Africa, and there remained. From this the Africans are called Phoenicians. Cilix from his own name gave the name to Cilicia."[^hyg-178-brothers]

#### The Oracle and the Cow

"Cadmus in his wanderings came to Delphi. There the oracle told him to buy from farmers an ox which had a moon-shaped mark on its side, and to drive it before him. Where it lay down it was fated that he found a town and rule."[^hyg-178-oracle] The moon-shaped mark is a detail not in the Bibliotheca.

"When Cadmus heard the oracle, he did as he was told."[^hyg-178-obey]

#### The Dragon of Castalia

"While seeking water he came to the fountain of Castalia, which a dragon, the offspring of Mars, was guarding. It killed the comrades of Cadmus, but was killed by Cadmus with a stone."[^hyg-178-dragon] This specifies the weapon (a stone) and names the spring as Castalia.

#### The Sparti

"Under Minerva's instructions he sowed the teeth and ploughed them under. From them sprang the Sparti. These fought themselves, but from them five survived, namely, Chthonius, Udaeus, Hyperenor, Pelorus, and Echion."[^hyg-178-sparti]

#### Etymology

"Moreover, Boeotia was named from the ox Cadmus followed."[^hyg-178-boeotia] This provides the folk etymology connecting Boeotia to the Greek word for ox (bous).

[^hyg-6-serpents]: "Cadmus, son of Agenor and Argiope, along with Harmonia his wife, daughter of Venus and Mars, after their children had been killed, were turned into snakes in the region of Illyria by the wrath of Mars, because Cadmus had slain the dragon, guardian of the fountain of Castalia" (Fabulae §6, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-178-europa]: "Europa was the daughter of Argiope and Agenor, a Sidonian. Jupiter, changing his form to that of a bull, carried her from Sidon to Crete, and begat by her Minos, Sarpedon, and Rhadamanthus" (Fabulae §178, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-178-search]: "Her father Agenor sent his sons to bring their sister back, or else not to return to his sight" (Fabulae §178, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-178-brothers]: "Phoenix set out for Africa, and there remained. From this the Africans are called Phoenicians. Cilix from his own name gave the name to Cilicia" (Fabulae §178, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-178-oracle]: "Cadmus in his wanderings came to Delphi. There the oracle told him to buy from farmers an ox which had a moon-shaped mark on its side, and to drive it before him. Where it lay down it was fated that he found a town and rule" (Fabulae §178, trans. Mary Grant)

[^hyg-178-dragon]: "While seeking water he came to the fountain of Castalia, which a dragon, the offspring of Mars, was guarding. It killed the comrades of Cadmus, but was killed by Cadmus with a stone" (Fabulae §178, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-178-sparti]: "Under Minerva's instructions he sowed the teeth and ploughed them under. From them sprang the Sparti. These fought themselves, but from them five survived, namely, Chthonius, Udaeus, Hyperenor, Pelorus, and Echion" (Fabulae §178, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-178-boeotia]: "Moreover, Boeotia was named from the ox Cadmus followed" (Fabulae §178, trans. Mary Grant)

## In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md)

### Europa and the Quest (3.1-13)

The Metamorphoses opens Book III with Cadmus's situation after [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) (Jupiter) carried off Europa: "Jupiter had not revealed himself, nor laid aside the semblance of a bull, until they stood upon the plains of Crete." Cadmus's father "bade her brother Cadmus search through all the world, until he found his sister, and proclaimed him doomed to exile if he found her not; thus was he good and wicked in one deed."[^met-cad-exile] [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) (Phoebus) told him to follow a heifer that had never known the yoke and found a city where she lay down — "and its name shall be the City of Boeotia."[^met-cad-oracle]

### The Dragon of Mars (3.26-94)

Cadmus followed the cow to Boeotia, where he prepared to sacrifice to [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md). His men went to a grove to draw water, but a dragon "sacred to the war-like Mars" guarded a spring there — "crested and gorgeous with radescent scales, and eyes that sparkled as the glow of coals. A deadly venom had puffed up his bulk, and from his jaws he darted forth three tongues, and in a triple row his sharp teeth stood."[^met-cad-dragon] The dragon killed Cadmus's companions.

Cadmus attacked: he first hurled "a mill-stone huge" which the dragon's armoured scales repelled, then pierced it with a javelin through the spine. The dragon fought back — "his throat was swollen with great knotted veins; a white froth gathered on his poisonous jaws; the earth resounded with his rasping scales." Finally Cadmus pinned the serpent through the neck to an oak tree with his spear: "the stout trunk bending with the monster's weight, groaned at the lashing of his serpent tail."[^met-cad-fight]

### The Sown Men (3.95-130)

As Cadmus gazed on the slain dragon, a voice warned: "Son of Agenor, why art thou here standing by this carcase-worm, for others shall behold thy body changed into a serpent."[^met-cad-voice] [Athena](../deities/athena.md) (Minerva) appeared and commanded him to sow the dragon's teeth. From the furrows, armed men grew — "A spear-point first appeared above the furrows, followed next by helmet-covered heads, nodding their cones; their shoulders, breasts and arms weighted with spears."[^met-cad-sparti] They fought each other until only five survived, including Echion, who by Athena's warning called for peace. These five became Cadmus's "trusted comrades" in building the city Apollo had named.[^met-cad-five]

### Transformation to Serpents (4.563-603)

In Book IV, after years of grief over his descendants' fates, "the founder fled the city he had built" and arrived in Illyria with Harmonia. Recalling the dragon he had killed, Cadmus said: "If haply 'tis the Gods, whose rage unerring, gives me to revenge, I only pray that I may lengthen out, as any serpent."[^met-cad-wish]

Immediately "he saw and felt himself increase in length. His body coiled into a serpent's form; bright scales enveloped his indurate skin, and azure macules in speckled pride, enriched his glowing folds." While arms remained, he called to Harmonia: "Come hither my unhappy wife, while aught is left of manhood; touch me, take my hand, unchanged as yet."[^met-cad-transform] But his tongue became twin-forked and he could only hiss. Harmonia begged to be transformed too; both became "crested snakes" in "brightly glistening mail." The narrator adds: "these gentle serpents never shun mankind, nor wound, nor strike with poisoned fangs; for they are always conscious of the past."[^met-cad-gentle]

[^met-cad-exile]: "her father bade her brother Cadmus search through all the world, until he found his sister, and proclaimed him doomed to exile if he found her not; thus was he good and wicked in one deed" (Metamorphoses 3.3-7, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-cad-oracle]: "When on the plains a heifer, that has never known the yoke, shall cross thy path go thou thy way with her, and follow where she leads; and when she lies, to rest herself upon the meadow green, there shalt thou stop... and its name shall be the City of Boeotia" (Metamorphoses 3.10-18)
[^met-cad-dragon]: "crested and gorgeous with radescent scales, and eyes that sparkled as the glow of coals. A deadly venom had puffed up his bulk, and from his jaws he darted forth three tongues, and in a triple row his sharp teeth stood" (Metamorphoses 3.32-34)
[^met-cad-fight]: "his throat was swollen with great knotted veins; a white froth gathered on his poisonous jaws; the earth resounded with his rasping scales... to this he fixed the dragon through the neck: the stout trunk bending with the monster's weight, groaned at the lashing of his serpent tail" (Metamorphoses 3.75-94)
[^met-cad-voice]: "Son of Agenor, why art thou here standing by this carcase-worm, for others shall behold thy body changed into a serpent" (Metamorphoses 3.97-99)
[^met-cad-sparti]: "A spear-point first appeared above the furrows, followed next by helmet-covered heads, nodding their cones; their shoulders, breasts and arms weighted with spears; and largely grew the shielded crop of men" (Metamorphoses 3.106-112)
[^met-cad-five]: "Echion, by Minerva warned, called on his brothers to give up the fight, and cast his arms away in pledge of faith" (Metamorphoses 3.126-128)
[^met-cad-wish]: "Was that a sacred dragon that my spear impaled... If haply 'tis the Gods, whose rage unerring, gives me to revenge, I only pray that I may lengthen out, as any serpent" (Metamorphoses 4.573-584)
[^met-cad-transform]: "he saw and felt himself increase in length. His body coiled into a serpent's form; bright scales enveloped his indurate skin, and azure macules in speckled pride, enriched his glowing folds... Come hither my unhappy wife, while aught is left of manhood; touch me, take my hand, unchanged as yet" (Metamorphoses 4.576-597)
[^met-cad-gentle]: "these gentle serpents never shun mankind, nor wound, nor strike with poisoned fangs; for they are always conscious of the past" (Metamorphoses 4.601-603)

## In Euripides' Bacchae

In the [Bacchae](../sources/euripides-bacchae.md), Cadmus appears as an old man who has surrendered the kingship to his grandson [Pentheus](pentheus.md). He willingly accepts [Dionysus](../deities/dionysus.md)'s worship, dressing in fawnskin and ivy alongside [Tiresias](tiresias.md): "we needs must extol him, who is the son sprung from my daughter, Bacchus, who has appeared as a God to men, as much as is in our power."[^eur-bac-extol] He and Tiresias prepare to dance despite their age — "Gladly we forget that we are old."[^eur-bac-old]

Cadmus pragmatically urges Pentheus to accept the god, even suggesting a pious lie: "although this may not be a God, as you say, let it be said by you that he is; and tell a glorious falsehood, that Semele may seem to have borne a God."[^eur-bac-pragmatic] He warns Pentheus of Actaeon's fate as a parallel.

After Pentheus's death, Cadmus gathers his grandson's scattered remains from Cithaeron: "whose body here, laboring with immeasurable search, I bear, having found it in the defiles of Cithæron, torn to pieces, and finding nothing in the same place."[^eur-bac-gather] He gently brings Agave to recognize the head she carries as her son's.

Dionysus then pronounces a harsh fate on Cadmus: "you shall become a dragon, and your wife becoming a beast, shall receive in exchange the form of a serpent, Harmonia, the daughter of Mars." He will drive a chariot of heifers and lead a barbarian army that sacks many cities, including [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md)'s oracle, before [Ares](../deities/ares.md) rescues him and Harmonia to the Islands of the Blessed.[^eur-bac-fate] Cadmus protests: "It is not right for Gods to resemble mortals in anger." Dionysus replies: "My father, Jove, long ago decreed this."[^eur-bac-anger]

[^eur-bac-extol]: "we needs must extol him, who is the son sprung from my daughter, Bacchus, who has appeared as a God to men, as much as is in our power" (Bacchae 181-183, trans. T.A. Buckley)
[^eur-bac-old]: "Gladly we forget that we are old" (Bacchae 188, trans. T.A. Buckley)
[^eur-bac-pragmatic]: "although this may not be a God, as you say, let it be said by you that he is; and tell a glorious falsehood, that Semele may seem to have borne a God, and that honor may redound to all our race" (Bacchae 333-336, trans. T.A. Buckley)
[^eur-bac-gather]: "whose body here, laboring with immeasurable search, I bear, having found it in the defiles of Cithæron, torn to pieces, and finding nothing in the same place, lying in a thicket, difficult to be searched" (Bacchae 1216-1221, trans. T.A. Buckley)
[^eur-bac-fate]: "you shall become a dragon, and your wife becoming a beast, shall receive in exchange the form of a serpent, Harmonia, the daughter of Mars... And as the oracle of Jove says, you shall drive with your wife a chariot of heifers, ruling over barbarians" (Bacchae 1330-1339, trans. T.A. Buckley)
[^eur-bac-anger]: "It is not right for Gods to resemble mortals in anger" / "My father, Jove, long ago decreed this" (Bacchae 1348-1349, trans. T.A. Buckley)
