## Overview

**Hippolyte** was the legendary queen of the Amazons, a warlike nation of women dwelling along the river Thermodon. She is famous both for the belt of [Ares](../deities/ares.md) that she wore as a mark of her sovereignty and for her marriage to the Athenian hero [Theseus](theseus.md). Her death in battle became the subject of tragic accounts, and her son [Hippolytus](hippolytus.md) would become famous in his own right.

## In the Bibliotheca

### The Amazons and Hippolyte's Belt

Hippolyte is introduced as leader of a remarkable nation: "She was queen of the Amazons, who dwelt about the river Thermodon, a people great in war; for they cultivated the manly virtues, and if ever they gave birth to children through intercourse with the other sex, they reared the females; and they pinched off the right breasts that they might not be trammelled by them in throwing the javelin, but they kept the left breasts, that they might suckle."[^apd-amazons]

As queen, "Hippolyte had the belt of Ares in token of her superiority to all the rest. Hercules was sent to fetch this belt because Admete, daughter of Eurystheus, desired to get it."[^apd-belt]

### Marriage to Theseus

Theseus, accompanying [Heracles](heracles.md) on his mission, took a different approach: "[Theseus] joined Hercules in his expedition against the Amazons and carried off Antiope, or, as some say, Melanippe; but Simonides calls her Hippolyte. Wherefore the Amazons marched against Athens, and having taken up a position about the Areopagus they were vanquished by the Athenians under Theseus."[^apd-theseus] Thus she became the wife of [Theseus](theseus.md) and bore him [Hippolytus](hippolytus.md).

### Death and Variant Traditions

The sources vary regarding her death. One account states: "Hippolyte was the mother of Hippolytus; she also goes by the names of Glauce and Melanippe. For when the marriage of Phaedra was being celebrated, Hippolyte appeared in arms with her Amazons, and said that she would slay the guests of Theseus. So a battle took place, and she was killed, whether involuntarily by her ally Penthesilia, or by Theseus, or because his men, seeing the threatening attitude of the Amazons, hastily closed the doors and so intercepted and slew her."[^apd-death]

Another tradition holds that it was [Penthesilia](penthesilia.md), a later Amazon queen, who killed her: "[Penthesilia], daughter of Otrere and Ares, accidentally killed Hippolyte and was purified by Priam."[^apd-penthesilia]
