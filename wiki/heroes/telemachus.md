## Overview

**Telemachus** is the son of [Odysseus](odysseus.md) and [Penelope](penelope.md). He was an infant when his father left for the Trojan War and a young man of about twenty when Odysseus returned. The first four books of the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) — sometimes called the "Telemachy" — follow his journey from frustrated youth to capable son, guided throughout by [Athena](../deities/athena.md).

## Epithets

- **"wise Telemachus"** — the most frequent epithet, used throughout the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md)[^ep-wise]

## In the Odyssey

### Athena's Visit (Book I)

[Athena](../deities/athena.md), disguised as Mentes, visits Telemachus in Ithaca while the suitors feast in his father's hall. She finds him "sitting with a heavy heart among the wooers dreaming on his good father, if haply he might come somewhence, and make a scattering of the wooers there throughout the palace, and himself get honour and bear rule among his own possessions."[^od1-sitting]

He shows instinctive hospitality: seeing the stranger at the gate, "he thought it blame in his heart that a stranger should stand long at the gates: and halting nigh her he clasped her right hand and took from her the spear of bronze."[^od1-greeting] He seats Athena apart from the suitors "lest the stranger should be disquieted by the noise."[^od1-apart]

After Athena's encouragement, Telemachus asserts himself for the first time, silencing [Penelope](penelope.md) when she protests the minstrel's song of Troy: "But speech shall be for men, for all, but for me in chief; for mine is the lordship in the house."[^od1-lordship] The suitors "bit their lips and marvelled at Telemachus, in that he spake boldly."[^od1-bold]

[^od1-sitting]: "he was sitting with a heavy heart among the wooers dreaming on his good father, if haply he might come somewhence, and make a scattering of the wooers there throughout the palace, and himself get honour and bear rule among his own possessions" (Odyssey 1.116-120)
[^od1-greeting]: "he thought it blame in his heart that a stranger should stand long at the gates: and halting nigh her he clasped her right hand and took from her the spear of bronze" (Odyssey 1.122-124)
[^od1-apart]: "he placed an inlaid seat hard by, apart from the company of the wooers, lest the stranger should be disquieted by the noise" (Odyssey 1.137-138)
[^od1-lordship]: "But speech shall be for men, for all, but for me in chief; for mine is the lordship in the house" (Odyssey 1.349-351)
[^od1-bold]: "they all bit their lips and marvelled at Telemachus, in that he spake boldly" (Odyssey 18.407-408)

### The Journey (Books III-IV)

Guided by Athena (now disguised as Mentor), Telemachus sails to Pylos and Sparta to seek news of his father. At Pylos, Nestor recognises him by his speech: "amazement comes upon me as I look at thee; for verily thy speech is like unto his; none would say that a younger man would speak so like an elder."[^od3-nestor]

At Sparta, [Menelaus](menelaus.md) and [Helen](helen.md) receive him and tell of Odysseus's exploits at Troy. Menelaus reveals what he learned from Proteus: that Odysseus was alive on [Calypso](../deities/calypso.md)'s island.

Meanwhile the suitors discover his departure and lie in ambush, but Athena warns him in a dream to return by a different route.

[^od3-nestor]: "amazement comes upon me as I look at thee; for verily thy speech is like unto his; none would say that a younger man would speak so like an elder" (Odyssey 3.129-130)

### The Recognition (Book XVI)

When [Odysseus](odysseus.md) reveals himself at the swineherd Eumaeus's hut, Telemachus first thinks him a god: "Thou art not Odysseus my father, but some god beguiles me, that I may groan for more exceeding sorrow. For it cannot be that a mortal man should contrive this by the aid of his own wit."[^od16-disbelief] When Odysseus insists — "nay, thy father am I, for whose sake thou sufferest many pains" — Telemachus accepts him: "flinging himself upon his noble father's neck, mourned and shed tears, and in both their hearts arose the desire of lamentation. And they wailed aloud, more ceaselessly than birds, sea-eagles or vultures of crooked claws."[^od16-reunion]

Together they plot the destruction of the suitors.

[^od16-disbelief]: "Thou art not Odysseus my father, but some god beguiles me, that I may groan for more exceeding sorrow. For it cannot be that a mortal man should contrive this by the aid of his own wit, unless a god were himself to visit him, and lightly of his own will to make him young or old" (Odyssey 16.200-204)
[^od16-reunion]: "Telemachus, flinging himself upon his noble father's neck, mourned and shed tears, and in both their hearts arose the desire of lamentation. And they wailed aloud, more ceaselessly than birds, sea-eagles or vultures of crooked claws, whose younglings the country folk have taken from the nest, ere yet they are fledged" (Odyssey 16.216-221)

### The Slaying of the Suitors (Books XXI-XXII)

Telemachus fights alongside his father, Eumaeus, and Philoetius against the suitors. In the [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md), the slaying is summarised: Odysseus "shot down the suitors, with the help of Eumaeus, Philoetius, and Telemachus."[^apd-slaying]

[^apd-slaying]: "Ulysses took it and shot down the suitors, with the help of Eumaeus, Philoetius, and Telemachus" (Bibliotheca E.7.32-7.33, trans. J.G. Frazer)

## In the Bibliotheca

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) mentions Telemachus in several contexts. Palamedes forced [Odysseus](odysseus.md) to reveal his feigned madness by "snatching Telemachus from [Penelope](penelope.md)'s bosom" and drawing a sword "as if he would kill him. And in his fear for the child Ulysses confessed that his madness was pretended."[^apd-madness]

[^apd-madness]: "Palamedes followed him, and snatching Telemachus from Penelope's bosom, drew his sword as if he would kill him. And in his fear for the child Ulysses confessed that his madness was pretended" (Bibliotheca E.3.7, trans. J.G. Frazer)

## In the Epic Cycle

In the Telegony, after Odysseus's death at the hands of Telegonus, "Telegonus, on discovering who he was, with Telemachus and Penelope returned to his home on the island of Aeaea." There [Circe](../deities/circe.md) "made them immortal," and Telemachus married Circe, while Telegonus married Penelope.[^tel-marriage]

[^tel-marriage]: "Telemachus marries Circe" (Telegony, summary by Proclus; cf. Fabulae §127: "Telemachus married Circe")

## In the Fabulae

In the [Fabulae](../sources/hyginus.md) (§127), after Odysseus was killed by Telegonus, "Telegonus on discovering who he was, with Telemachus and [Penelope](penelope.md) returned to his home on the island of Aeaea by [Athena](../deities/athena.md)'s instructions." The marriages are specified: "by the advice of [Athena](../deities/athena.md) again, Telegonus married Penelope, and Telemachus married [Circe](../deities/circe.md). From Circe and Telemachus Latinus was born, who gave his name to the Latin language."[^hyg-127]

[^hyg-127]: "by the advice of Minerva again, Telegonus married Penelope, and Telemachus married Circe. From Circe and Telemachus Latinus was born, who gave his name to the Latin language" (Fabulae §127, trans. Mary Grant)
