## Overview

**Phineus** is a blind prophet who lived on the coast of Bithynia. Son of Agenor and son-in-law of Boreas, he possessed the gift of prophecy granted by [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md), but was punished by [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) with blindness and unending old age for revealing the divine will too completely. The [Harpies](../creatures/harpies.md) snatched his food and fouled his table daily. The Argonauts freed him from this torment, and in return he prophesied their route to [Colchis](../places/colchis.md).

### Punishment and Condition

Phineus "above all men endured most bitter woes because of the gift of prophecy which Leto's son had granted him aforetime."[^arg2-woes] His offense was that "he reverenced not a whit even Zeus himself, for he foretold unerringly to men his sacred will. Wherefore Zeus sent upon him a lingering old age, and took from his eyes the pleasant light, and suffered him not to have joy of the dainties untold that the dwellers around ever brought to his house."[^arg2-punishment]

The [Harpies](../creatures/harpies.md) compounded his misery, swooping "through the clouds" with "crooked beaks" to "incessantly snatch the food away from his mouth and hands."[^arg2-harpies] At times not a morsel was left; at others only a little, to keep him alive in torment. Whatever they left behind was polluted: "they poured forth over all a loathsome stench; and no one dared not merely to carry food to his mouth but even to stand at a distance; so foully reeked the remnants of the meal."[^arg2-stench]

[^arg2-woes]: "Phineus, son of Agenor, had his home by the sea, Phineus who above all men endured most bitter woes because of the gift of prophecy which Leto's son had granted him aforetime" (Argonautica 2.178-180, trans. R.C. Seaton)

### Appearance

Apollonius describes Phineus's physical state in detail. He recognized the Argonauts' approach by [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md)'s oracle: "he rose from his couch, like a lifeless dream, bowed over his staff, and crept to the door on his withered feet, feeling the walls; and as he moved, his limbs trembled for weakness and age; and his parched skin was caked with dirt, and naught but the skill held his bones together. And he came forth from the hall with wearied knees and sat on the threshold of the courtyard; and a dark stupor covered him, and it seemed that the earth reeled round beneath his feet, and he lay in a strengthless trance, speechless."[^arg2-appearance]

And he came forth from the hall with wearied knees and sat on the threshold of the courtyard; and a dark stupor covered him, and it seemed that the earth reeled round beneath his feet, and he lay in a strengthless trance, speechless" (Argonautica 2.197-205)

### Rescue by the Argonauts

Phineus knew by oracle that the sons of Boreas would be the ones to drive away the Harpies: "These pests, the oracle declares, the sons of Boreas shall restrain."[^arg2-oracle] He identified himself to the Argonauts and appealed to them by Zeus the god of suppliants, by Phoebus, and by [Hera](../deities/hera.md), whom the heroes especially honored. He recalled his former identity: "I am Phineus who was once renowned among men for wealth and the gift of prophecy... when I ruled among the Thracians, by my bridal gifts I brought home their sister Cleopatra to be my wife."[^arg2-identity]

Zetes and Calais, the winged sons of Boreas, agreed to help after Phineus swore by the gods that no divine wrath would fall upon them for doing so. The younger Argonauts prepared a feast and set it before Phineus as bait. The [Harpies](../creatures/harpies.md) came at once, "like bitter blasts or flashes of lightning, suddenly darted from the clouds, and swooped down with a yell, fiercely craving for food."[^arg2-swoop] They devoured everything and fled, leaving an "intolerable stench." Zetes and Calais pursued them; they outstripped even the west wind, but the sons of Boreas were given tireless strength by Zeus. When they had nearly caught the Harpies at the Floating Islands, [Iris](../deities/iris.md) descended and checked them: "It is not lawful, O sons of Boreas, to strike with your swords the Harpies, the hounds of mighty Zeus; but I myself will give you a pledge, that hereafter they shall not draw near to Phineus."[^arg2-iris] She swore by the waters of Styx that the Harpies would never again approach Phineus, and the islands where they turned back became known as the Islands of Turning.

[^arg2-oracle]: "These pests, the oracle declares, the sons of Boreas shall restrain" (Argonautica 2.229-230)
[^arg2-identity]: "I am Phineus who was once renowned among men for wealth and the gift of prophecy, and if I am the son of my father Agenor; and, when I ruled among the Thracians, by my bridal gifts I brought home their sister Cleopatra to be my wife" (Argonautica 2.231-235)

### Phineus's Prophecy

After feasting ravenously — "as in a dream" — Phineus sat by the hearth and addressed the Argonauts. He declared that Zeus wishes prophecy delivered incomplete: "he himself wishes to deliver to men the utterances of the prophetic art incomplete, in order that they may still have some need to know the will of heaven."[^arg2-divine-will]

His instructions for the voyage were detailed: first, the twin Cyanean (Clashing) Rocks, where the two seas meet. He advised releasing a dove to test the passage: if it made it through, the crew should row with all their might; if it perished midway, they should turn back.[^arg2-rocks] Beyond the rocks, he described the Bithynian coast, the river Rhebas, the Mariandyni, the headland of Acherusia with its path to Hades, the Paphlagonians, the headland Carambis, the river Halys, the Amazons and their three cities, the Chalybes (ironworkers), the Tibareni, the Mossynoeci, the island of Ares, and finally the river Phasis leading to [Colchis](../places/colchis.md): "Guide your ship to the mouth of that river and ye shall behold the towers of Cytaean Aeetes and the shady grove of Ares, where a dragon, a monster terrible to behold, ever glares around, keeping watch over the fleece."[^arg2-colchis]

When Jason asked about the return route, Phineus was more guarded, saying only that a deity would guide them from Aea by another track, and urging them above all: "take thought of the artful aid of the Cyprian goddess. For on her depends the glorious issue of your venture."[^arg2-cyprian]

[^arg2-divine-will]: "he himself wishes to deliver to men the utterances of the prophetic art incomplete, in order that they may still have some need to know the will of heaven" (Argonautica 2.318-320)
[^arg2-rocks]: "First entrust the attempt to a dove when ye have sent her forth from the ship. And if she escapes safe with her wings between the rocks to the open sea, then no more do ye refrain from the path, but grip your oars well in your hands and cleave the sea's narrow strait" (Argonautica 2.331-335)
[^arg2-colchis]: "Guide your ship to the mouth of that river and ye shall behold the towers of Cytaean Aeetes and the shady grove of Ares, where a dragon, a monster terrible to behold, ever glares around, keeping watch over the fleece that is spread upon the top of an oak; neither by day nor by night does sweet sleep subdue his restless eyes" (Argonautica 2.400-403)
[^arg2-cyprian]: "take thought of the artful aid of the Cyprian goddess. For on her depends the glorious issue of your venture" (Argonautica 2.423-424)

### Character as a Prophet and Host

After his rescue, Phineus continued to serve his neighbors. Every day people came to consult him, bringing him portions of food: "to all alike, however poor he was that came, the aged man gave his oracles with good will, and freed many from their woes by his prophetic art."[^arg2-neighbors] His closest neighbor Paraebius was especially devoted, having been freed from a curse inherited from his father. When Jason offered his sympathy and hoped the gods might restore Phineus's sight, Phineus replied with resigned resignation: "Son of Aeson, that is past recall, nor is there any remedy hereafter, for blasted are my sightless eyes. But instead of that, may the god grant me death at once, and after death I shall take my share in perfect bliss."[^arg2-resign]
