## Overview

**Astyanax** (also called Scamandrios) was the infant son of [Hector](hector.md) and [Andromache](andromache.md), and grandson of [Priam](priam.md) and [Hecuba](hecuba.md). After the fall of [Troy](../places/troy.md), the Greeks killed him — in most accounts by hurling him from the city walls — to prevent the son of their greatest enemy from growing to avenge his father. His death is one of the most recurrent images of war's cruelty in Greek literature.

## In the Iliad

### The Scaean Gates (Book VI)

Astyanax appears in the farewell scene between Hector and Andromache at the Scaean Gates. A handmaid carries "the tender child" as Andromache comes to meet her husband. When Hector reaches for his son, the boy cries in fear at his father's plumed helmet: "his dear father laughed aloud, and his lady mother; forthwith glorious Hector took the helmet from his head, and laid it, all gleaming, upon the earth; then kissed he his dear son and dandled him in his arms."[^il6-helmet] Hector prayed that his son would surpass him in greatness: "Far greater is he than his father."[^il6-prayer]

The [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) explains his name: "Hector called him Scamandrios, but all the others called him Astyanax (lord of the city), for Hector alone was the protector of Ilion."[^il6-name]

### Andromache's Laments (Books XXII, XXIV)

After Hector's death, Andromache lamented Astyanax's fate as an orphan — the boy who had sat on his father's knee eating marrow and fat would now beg at others' tables: "the child is yet but a little one, born of thee and me, ill-fated."[^il22-child] At Hector's funeral, she prophesied with chilling accuracy: "for either they will slay him with them at the ships, being wroth for a kinsman, or else he will touch the hands of an Achaean, and will be hurled from a tower in his bitterness, because Hector once slew his sire."[^il24-tower]

## In the Epic Cycle

In the *Little Iliad*, [Neoptolemus](neoptolemus.md) personally killed Astyanax: he "snatched him from the bosom of his rich-haired nurse and seized him by the foot and cast him from a tower. So when he had fallen bloody death and hard fate seized on Astyanax."[^epic-death]

## In the Metamorphoses

[Ovid](../sources/metamorphoses.md) mentions Astyanax's death among the horrors [Hecuba](hecuba.md) witnessed at Troy's fall: he was "hurled down from the very tower from which he often had looked forth and seen his father, by his mother pointed out, when Hector fought for honor and his country's weal."[^met-fall]

## In the Posthomerica

In the [Posthomerica](../sources/posthomerica.md), the Greek warriors collectively tore Astyanax from [Andromache](andromache.md)'s arms during the sack: "those Danaan car-lords hurl from a high tower the babe Astyanax, dashing him out of life. They tore the child out of his mother's arms, in wrathful hate of Hector, who in life had dealt to them such havoc."[^post-death]

## In Euripides' Trojan Women

The [Trojan Women](../sources/euripides-trojan-women.md) gives Astyanax's death its fullest dramatic treatment. By [Odysseus](odysseus.md)'s counsel, the Greeks decree that "the son of one so perilous be not fostered on to manhood" and that he must be hurled from Troy's walls.[^tw-decree]

### Andromache's Farewell

[Andromache](andromache.md)'s farewell to her son is one of the play's most harrowing scenes: "Go, die, my best-beloved, my cherished one, in fierce men's hands, leaving me here alone. Thy father was too valiant; that is why they slay thee!"[^tw-farewell] She describes the manner of death: "One horrible spring ... deep, deep down. And thy neck.... Ah God, so cometh sleep!" She recalls his sweetness — "Thou little thing that curlest in my arms, what sweet scents cling all round thy neck!" — and begs: "Kiss me. This one time; not ever again. Put up thine arms, and climb about my neck: now, kiss me, lips to lips."[^tw-kiss]

### Hecuba's Lament

Talthybius returns bearing the dead child on [Hector](hector.md)'s great shield — Andromache, already taken to the ships, had asked that the shield serve as her son's coffin. [Hecuba](hecuba.md) prepares the tiny body for burial: "There lieth here a babe whom the Greeks feared, and in their fear slew him."[^tw-epitaph] She recalls how the boy had once promised: "Grandmother, when thou art dead, I will cut close my hair and lead out all the captains to ride by thy tomb."[^tw-promise] She describes his broken body — "these little flowers innocent that were thy mother's garden, where she laid her kisses; here, just where the bone-edge frayed grins white above" — and wraps him in garments meant for his future wedding.[^tw-wounds]

## Variant Traditions

The identity of Astyanax's killer differs across sources:

- In the [Epic Cycle](../sources/epic-cycle.md) (*Little Iliad*), [Neoptolemus](neoptolemus.md) personally snatches him from his nurse and casts him from a tower.
- In the [Posthomerica](../sources/posthomerica.md), the Greek warriors collectively tear him from Andromache and hurl him from the wall.
- In Euripides' [Trojan Women](../sources/euripides-trojan-women.md), the killing is ordered by the army at [Odysseus](odysseus.md)'s counsel, and carried out by unnamed soldiers.
- The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) records simply that "Neoptolemus slew Astyanax" (E.5.23).

The motivation also varies: the Trojan Women explicitly attributes the decision to fear that the son of Hector might grow up to rebuild Troy and seek vengeance. The Posthomerica attributes it to "wrathful hate of Hector."
