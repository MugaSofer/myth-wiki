## Overview

**Palamedes** was a clever warrior and the son of [Nauplius](nauplius.md), the sailor famous for luring Greeks to their deaths with false beacon lights. Though Palamedes himself is recorded as a brave warrior who participated in the [Trojan War](../events/trojan-war.md), he is chiefly remembered for exposing [Odysseus](odysseus.md)'s pretense of madness to avoid military service—a shrewd act of judgment that earned him [Odysseus](odysseus.md)'s undying hatred and led to his tragic downfall.

## In the Bibliotheca

Palamedes is introduced through his parentage: "By her he had Palamedes, Oeax, and Nausimedon."[^apd-parentage] Later sources identify his mother as Clymene: "[Catreus] gave Aerope and Clymene to Nauplius to sell into foreign lands... and Clymene became the wife of Nauplius, who became the father of Oeax and Palamedes."[^apd-clymene]

### Exposing Odysseus's Deception

When the Greek kings gathered for the [Trojan War](../events/trojan-war.md), [Odysseus](odysseus.md) attempted to avoid conscription by feigning madness. However, Palamedes saw through the ruse: "But he, not wishing to go to the war, feigned madness. However, Palamedes, son of Nauplius, proved his madness to be fictitious; and when Ulysses pretended to rave, Palamedes followed him, and snatching Telemachus from Penelope's bosom, drew his sword as if he would kill him. And in his fear for the child Ulysses confessed that his madness was pretended, and he went to the war."[^apd-madness]

### Betrayal and Execution

[Odysseus](odysseus.md) never forgave this exposure. "Having taken a Phrygian prisoner, Ulysses compelled him to write a letter of treasonable purport ostensibly sent by Priam to Palamedes; and having buried gold in the quarters of Palamedes, he dropped the letter in the camp. Agamemnon read the letter, found the gold, and delivered up Palamedes to the allies to be stoned as a traitor."[^apd-frame]

### Revenge from Beyond

Years later, after the Greeks returned home from Troy, "Palamedes, the son of Nauplius and Clymene daughter of Catreus, had been stoned to death through the machinations of Ulysses. And when Nauplius learned of it, he sailed to the Greeks and claimed satisfaction for the death of his son; but when he returned unsuccessful (for they all favoured King Agamemnon, who had been the accomplice of Ulysses in the murder of Palamedes), he coasted along the Grecian lands and contrived that the wives of the Greeks should play their husbands false, Clytaemnestra with Aegisthus, Aegialia with Cometes, son of Sthenelus, and Meda, wife of Idomeneus, with Leucus."[^apd-revenge]
