## Overview

**Priam** is the king of [Troy](../places/troy.md) during the Trojan War and father of fifty sons and many daughters. His original name was Podarces; he was renamed Priam after being ransomed by his sister Hesione when [Heracles](heracles.md) sacked Troy. He is the last king of Troy, killed by Neoptolemus at the altar of Zeus.

## In the Bibliotheca

### Trojan Royal Line (3.12.1-5)

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) traces the royal line: [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) begot Dardanus, who founded Dardanus and married Batia. His descendant Tros named the country Troy and had three sons: Ilus, Assaracus, and Ganymede (whom Zeus snatched up for his beauty). Ilus founded Ilium and received the [Palladium](../sources/apollodorus.md) from heaven. Ilus's son Laomedon became father of Priam.[^apd-line]

"After that Ilium was captured by Hercules, as we have related a little before, Podarces, who was called Priam, came to the throne."[^apd-name]

### Paris's Birth and Exposure (3.12.5-6)

Priam's first son by Hecuba was Hector. "When a second babe was about to be born Hecuba dreamed she had brought forth a firebrand, and that the fire spread over the whole city and burned it." The interpreter Aesacus "declared that the child was begotten to be the ruin of his country and advised that the babe should be exposed."[^apd-paris-dream]

The infant Paris was exposed on Ida, "nursed for five days by a bear; and, when he [the servant Agelaus] found it safe, he took it up, carried it away, brought it up as his own son on his farm, and named him Paris. When he grew to be a young man, Paris excelled many in beauty and strength."[^apd-paris-bear]

### Cassandra and Apollo (3.12.5)

"Wishing to gain Cassandra's favours, [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) promised to teach her the art of prophecy; she learned the art but refused her favours; hence Apollo deprived her prophecy of power to persuade."[^apd-cassandra]

### The Fall of Troy and Death (E.5.21)

When the Greeks entered Troy from the Wooden Horse, "Neoptolemus slew Priam, who had taken refuge at the altar of Zeus of the Courtyard."[^apd-death]
