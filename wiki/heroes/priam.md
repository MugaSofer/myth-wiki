## Overview

**Priam** is the king of [Troy](../places/troy.md) during the Trojan War and father of fifty sons and many daughters. His original name was Podarces; he was renamed Priam after being ransomed by his sister Hesione when [Heracles](heracles.md) sacked Troy. He is the last king of Troy, killed by Neoptolemus at the altar of Zeus.

## Appearance

Priam is described only in old age, his appearance marked by grief. In his own plea before [Hector](hector.md)'s duel, he speaks of "when dogs defile the hoary head and hoary beard of an old man slain, this is the most piteous thing that cometh upon hapless men."[^il22-hoary]

When he comes to ransom Hector's body, [Achilles](achilles.md) sees the same features and responds with compassion: "he sprang from his seat and raised the old man by his hand, pitying his hoary head and hoary beard."[^il24-pity]

[^il22-hoary]: "when dogs defile the hoary head and hoary beard of an old man slain, this is the most piteous thing that cometh upon hapless men" (Iliad 22.78-80, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il24-pity]: "he sprang from his seat and raised the old man by his hand, pitying his hoary head and hoary beard" (Iliad 24.439-440)

## In the Iliad

### The Ransom of Hector (Book XXIV)

Priam's journey to Achilles' tent, guided by [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md), culminates in one of the most celebrated scenes in the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md). Achilles marvels at Priam's courage: "Ah hapless! many ill things verily thou hast endured in thy heart. How durst thou come alone to the ships of the Achaians and to meet the eyes of the man who hath slain full many of thy brave sons."[^il24-marvel]

[^il24-marvel]: "Ah hapless! many ill things verily thou hast endured in thy heart. How durst thou come alone to the ships of the Achaians and to meet the eyes of the man who hath slain full many of thy brave sons" (Iliad 24.441-442)

## In the Bibliotheca

### Trojan Royal Line (3.12.1-5)

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) traces the royal line: [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) begot Dardanus, who founded Dardanus and married Batia. His descendant Tros named the country Troy and had three sons: Ilus, Assaracus, and Ganymede (whom Zeus snatched up for his beauty). Ilus founded Ilium and received the [Palladium](../sources/apollodorus.md) from heaven. Ilus's son Laomedon became father of Priam.[^apd-line]

"After that Ilium was captured by Hercules, as we have related a little before, Podarces, who was called Priam, came to the throne."[^apd-name]

### Paris's Birth and Exposure (3.12.5-6)

Priam's first son by Hecuba was Hector. "When a second babe was about to be born Hecuba dreamed she had brought forth a firebrand, and that the fire spread over the whole city and burned it." The interpreter Aesacus "declared that the child was begotten to be the ruin of his country and advised that the babe should be exposed."[^apd-paris-dream]

The infant Paris was exposed on Ida, "nursed for five days by a bear; and, when he [the servant Agelaus] found it safe, he took it up, carried it away, brought it up as his own son on his farm, and named him Paris. When he grew to be a young man, Paris excelled many in beauty and strength."[^apd-paris-bear]

### Cassandra and Apollo (3.12.5)

"Wishing to gain Cassandra's favours, [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) promised to teach her the art of prophecy; she learned the art but refused her favours; hence Apollo deprived her prophecy of power to persuade."[^apd-cassandra]

### The Fall of Troy and Death (E.5.21)

When the Greeks entered Troy from the Wooden Horse, "Neoptolemus slew Priam, who had taken refuge at the altar of Zeus of the Courtyard."[^apd-death]

## In the Fabulae

### Laomedon's Sacking and Priam's Naming (§89)

The [Fabulae](../sources/hyginus.md) tells how Priam received his new name. After [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) killed the sea-monster that threatened [Troy](../places/troy.md), King Laomedon refused to give up his daughter Hesione or the promised horses. Heracles returned with vengeance: "assembling ships to attack Troy, came and slew Laomedon."[^hyg-sack]

The kingdom then passed to Laomedon's infant son with a significant renaming: Heracles "gave the kingdom to his infant son Podarces, who was afterward called apo tou priasthai, 'from being redeemed,' Priam."[^hyg-naming] The etymology connects Priam's name to the Greek word for "to redeem" or "to ransom."

[^hyg-sack]: "Hercules, assembling ships to attack Troy, came and slew Laomedon" (Fabulae §89, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-naming]: "gave the kingdom to his infant son Podarces, who was afterward called apo tou priasthai, 'from being redeemed,' Priam" (Fabulae §89, trans. Mary Grant)

### Priam's Fifty-Five Children (§90)

The Fabulae provides an extensive catalog of Priam's offspring, listing fifty-five "sons and daughters of Priam."[^hyg-number] The list includes the most famous names: "Hector, Deiphobus, Cebriones, Polydorus, Helenus, Alexander, Hippasidus, Antinous, Agathon, Dius, Mestor, Lysides, Polymedon, Ascanius, Chirodamas, Evagoras, Dryops, Astynomus, Polymelus, Laodice, Ethionome, Phegea, Henicea, Demnosia, Cassandra, Philomela, Polites, Troilus, Palaemon, Brissonius, Gorgythion, Protodamas, Aretus, Dolon, Chromius, Eresus, Chrysolaus, Demosthea, Doryclus, Hippasus, Hyperochus, Lysianassa, Iliona, Nereis, Evander, Proneos, Archemachus, Ilagus, Axion, Binates, Hippothous, Deiopites, Medusa, Hero, Creusa."[^hyg-children]

[^hyg-number]: "SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF PRIAM TO THE NUMBER OF LV" (Fabulae §90, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-children]: "Hector, Deiphobus, Cebriones, Polydorus, Helenus, Alexander, Hippasidus, Antinous, Agathon, Dius, Mestor, Lysides, Polymedon, Ascanius, Chirodamas, Evagoras, Dryops, Astynomus, Polymelus, Laodice, Ethionome, Phegea, Henicea, Demnosia, Cassandra, Philomela, Polites, Troilus, Palaemon, Brissonius, Gorgythion, Protodamas, Aretus, Dolon, Chromius, Eresus, Chrysolaus, Demosthea, Doryclus, Hippasus, Hyperochus, Lysianassa, Iliona, Nereis, Evander, Proneos, Archemachus, Ilagus, Axion, Binates, Hippothous, Deiopites, Medusa, Hero, Creusa" (Fabulae §90, trans. Mary Grant)

### Paris's Return to the Palace (§91)

The Fabulae gives the dramatic story of how Paris was recognized and restored to the royal family. After Hecuba's prophetic dream of "giving birth to a glowing firebrand from which many serpents issued," the seers warned that the child would be "the ruin of his country" and advised exposure.[^hyg-dream] "The servants out of pity exposed him. Shepherds found the child, raised him as their own, and named him Paris."[^hyg-shepherds]

Years later, a remarkable coincidence brought Paris back to Troy. Servants were sent "to bring a bull to be given as prize in funeral games in Paris' honor" — games held by the family that believed him dead. Paris followed them to the city: "He, out of fondness for the bull, went down and won everything, even over his own brothers."[^hyg-games]

The victory sparked conflict: "In anger Deiphobus drew his sword against him, but he leaped to the altar of Zeus Herceus."[^hyg-altar] At this moment of crisis, recognition came: "When Cassandra prophetically declared he was her brother, Priam acknowledged him and received him into the palace."[^hyg-return]

[^hyg-dream]: "in a dream saw herself giving birth to a glowing firebrand from which many serpents issued. When this vision was reported to all the seers, they bade her slay whatever child she should bear to avoid its being the ruin of the country" (Fabulae §91, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-shepherds]: "the servants out of pity exposed him. Shepherds found the child, raised him as their own, and named him Paris" (Fabulae §91, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-games]: "servants sent by Priam to bring a bull to be given as prize in funeral games in Paris' honor... He, out of fondness for the bull, went down and won everything, even over his own brothers" (Fabulae §91, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-altar]: "In anger Deiphobus drew his sword against him, but he leaped to the altar of Zeus Herceus" (Fabulae §91, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-return]: "When Cassandra prophetically declared he was her brother, Priam acknowledged him and received him into the palace" (Fabulae §91, trans. Mary Grant)

## In the [Aeneid](../sources/aeneid.md)

### The Death of Priam (2.506-558)

The [Aeneid](../sources/aeneid.md) gives the most detailed account of Priam's death. As Troy fell, Priam donned his armour despite his age: "the old man idly fastens round his aged trembling shoulders his long disused armour, girds on the unavailing sword, and advances on his death among the thronging foe."[^aen-pr-armour] [Hecuba](hecuba.md) tried to dissuade him, drawing him to the altar: "this altar will protect us all, or thou wilt share our death."[^aen-pr-hecuba]

Neoptolemus (Pyrrhus) killed Priam's son Polites before his eyes. Priam hurled a weak spear and rebuked him: "Ah, for thy crime, for this thy hardihood, may the gods, if there is goodness in heaven to care for aught such, pay thee in full thy worthy meed... not such to a foe was the Achilles whose parentage thou beliest; but he revered a suppliant's right and trust, restored to the tomb Hector's pallid corpse, and sent me back to my realm."[^aen-pr-rebuke]

Neoptolemus dragged him "quivering to the very altar, slipping in the pool of his child's blood, and wound his left hand in his hair, while in his right the sword flashed out and plunged to the hilt in his side." Aeneas reflects: "This was the end of Priam's fortunes... once magnificent lord over so many peoples and lands of Asia. The great corpse lies along the shore, a head severed from the shoulders and a body without a name."[^aen-pr-death]

[^aen-pr-armour]: "the old man idly fastens round his aged trembling shoulders his long disused armour, girds on the unavailing sword, and advances on his death among the thronging foe" (Aeneid 2.509-511, trans. J.W. Mackail)
[^aen-pr-hecuba]: "this altar will protect us all, or thou wilt share our death" (Aeneid 2.524)
[^aen-pr-rebuke]: "not such to a foe was the Achilles whose parentage thou beliest; but he revered a suppliant's right and trust, restored to the tomb Hector's pallid corpse, and sent me back to my realm" (Aeneid 2.540-543)
[^aen-pr-death]: "drew him quivering to the very altar, slipping in the pool of his child's blood, and wound his left hand in his hair, while in his right the sword flashed out and plunged to the hilt in his side. This was the end of Priam's fortunes... once magnificent lord over so many peoples and lands of Asia. The great corpse lies along the shore, a head severed from the shoulders and a body without a name" (Aeneid 2.550-558)

## In the Posthomerica

### Memnon's Arrival (Book II)

When the Trojan cause grows desperate after Penthesileia's death, Priam urges the assembled Trojans not to abandon the city but to hold on from the walls until their new champion arrives. He reveals that he sent Memnon an urgent summons: "in sore distress of soul, I sent him urgent summons. Yea, and he promised me, gladly promised me, to come to Troy, and make all end of all our woes."[^post-priam-memnon-urge] The speech ends with Priam counselling endurance: "better far it is like brave men in the fight to die than flee, and live in shame mid alien folk."[^post-priam-memnon-endure]

Memnon arrives shortly after with a vast host of Ethiopians, and Priam welcomes him with gifts and a great feast.[^post-priam-memnon-welcome] At the banquet, Priam pledges Memnon with a golden cup of extraordinary lineage: Hephaestus crafted it as a masterpiece and brought it to Zeus, who received it when he gave Aphrodite to Hephaestus as a bride. Zeus then bestowed it on his son Dardanus, who passed it to Erichthonius, who gave it to Tros, who bequeathed it to Ilus, who gave it to Laomedon, and Laomedon to Priam — "who had thought to leave the same to his own son. Fate ordered otherwise."[^post-priam-cup]

### Death at the Altar (Book XIII)

During the sack of Troy, [Neoptolemus](neoptolemus.md) kills three of Priam's sons in quick succession — Pammon, Polites, and Antiphonus — before finding the king himself at the altar of Zeus the Hearth-lord.[^post-priam-sons]

Priam does not flee or beg for mercy. Seeing Neoptolemus, "Old Priam knew him and quaked not; for he longed himself to lay his life down midst his sons."[^post-priam-quaked] He addresses Neoptolemus directly, requesting death: "Fierce-hearted son of Achilles strong in war, slay me, and pity not my misery. I have no will to see the sun's light more, who have suffered woes so many and so dread. With my sons would I die, and so forget anguish and horror of war."[^post-priam-speech] He adds a bitter reflection — he had wished [Achilles](achilles.md) had killed him when he came to ransom [Hector](hector.md)'s body: "He spared me — so the Fates had spun my thread of destiny."[^post-priam-fates]

Neoptolemus grants the request without hesitation: "Fain am I, yea, in haste to grant thy prayer. A foe like thee will I not leave alive."[^post-neo-answer] The execution is swift and almost casual: "With one stroke swept he off that hoary head lightly as when a reaper lops an ear in a parched cornfield at the harvest-tide."[^post-priam-death] The poet closes with an elegy: "So lay he, chiefest once of all the world in lineage, wealth, in many and goodly sons."[^post-priam-elegy]

[^post-priam-memnon-urge]: "in sore distress of soul, I sent him urgent summons. Yea, and he promised me, gladly promised me, to come to Troy, and make all end of all our woes" (Posthomerica 2.1460-1463, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post-priam-memnon-endure]: "better far it is like brave men in the fight to die than flee, and live in shame mid alien folk" (Posthomerica 2.1464-1467)
[^post-priam-memnon-welcome]: "with all observance welcomed he the strong son of the Lady of the Dawn with goodly gifts and with abundant cheer" (Posthomerica 2.1566-1568)
[^post-priam-cup]: "Then in his hands a chalice deep and wide he raised, and Memnon in all love he pledged in that huge golden cup, a gift of Gods... To Priam, who had thought to leave the same to his own son. Fate ordered otherwise" (Posthomerica 2.1602-1615)
[^post-priam-sons]: "Achilles' son with his resistless lance smote godlike Pammon; then his javelin pierced Polites in mid-rush: Antiphonus dead upon these he laid, all Priam's sons" (Posthomerica 13.9630-9633)
[^post-priam-quaked]: "Old Priam knew him and quaked not; for he longed himself to lay his life down midst his sons" (Posthomerica 13.9640-9641)
[^post-priam-speech]: "Fierce-hearted son of Achilles strong in war, slay me, and pity not my misery. I have no will to see the sun's light more, who have suffered woes so many and so dread. With my sons would I die, and so forget anguish and horror of war" (Posthomerica 13.9643-9648)
[^post-priam-fates]: "He spared me — so the Fates had spun my thread of destiny" (Posthomerica 13.9652-9653)
[^post-neo-answer]: "Fain am I, yea, in haste to grant thy prayer. A foe like thee will I not leave alive" (Posthomerica 13.9656-9657)

[^post-priam-elegy]: "So lay he, chiefest once of all the world in lineage, wealth, in many and goodly sons" (Posthomerica 13.9666-9667)
