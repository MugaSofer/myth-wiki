## Overview

**Priam** is the king of [Troy](../places/troy.md) during the Trojan War and father of fifty sons and many daughters. His original name was Podarces; he was renamed Priam after being ransomed by his sister Hesione when [Heracles](heracles.md) sacked Troy. He is the last king of Troy, killed by Neoptolemus at the altar of Zeus.

## In the Bibliotheca

### Trojan Royal Line (3.12.1-5)

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) traces the royal line: [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) begot Dardanus, who founded Dardanus and married Batia. His descendant Tros named the country Troy and had three sons: Ilus, Assaracus, and Ganymede (whom Zeus snatched up for his beauty). Ilus founded Ilium and received the [Palladium](../sources/apollodorus.md) from heaven. Ilus's son Laomedon became father of Priam.[^apd-line]

"After that Ilium was captured by Hercules, as we have related a little before, Podarces, who was called Priam, came to the throne."[^apd-name]

### Paris's Birth and Exposure (3.12.5-6)

Priam's first son by Hecuba was Hector. "When a second babe was about to be born Hecuba dreamed she had brought forth a firebrand, and that the fire spread over the whole city and burned it." The interpreter Aesacus "declared that the child was begotten to be the ruin of his country and advised that the babe should be exposed."[^apd-paris-dream]

The infant Paris was exposed on Ida, "nursed for five days by a bear; and, when he [the servant Agelaus] found it safe, he took it up, carried it away, brought it up as his own son on his farm, and named him Paris. When he grew to be a young man, Paris excelled many in beauty and strength."[^apd-paris-bear]

### Cassandra and Apollo (3.12.5)

"Wishing to gain Cassandra's favours, [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) promised to teach her the art of prophecy; she learned the art but refused her favours; hence Apollo deprived her prophecy of power to persuade."[^apd-cassandra]

### The Fall of Troy and Death (E.5.21)

When the Greeks entered Troy from the Wooden Horse, "Neoptolemus slew Priam, who had taken refuge at the altar of Zeus of the Courtyard."[^apd-death]

## In the Fabulae

### Laomedon's Sacking and Priam's Naming (§89)

The [Fabulae](../sources/hyginus.md) tells how Priam received his new name. After [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) killed the sea-monster that threatened [Troy](../places/troy.md), King Laomedon refused to give up his daughter Hesione or the promised horses. Heracles returned with vengeance: "assembling ships to attack Troy, came and slew Laomedon."[^hyg-sack]

The kingdom then passed to Laomedon's infant son with a significant renaming: Heracles "gave the kingdom to his infant son Podarces, who was afterward called apo tou priasthai, 'from being redeemed,' Priam."[^hyg-naming] The etymology connects Priam's name to the Greek word for "to redeem" or "to ransom."

[^hyg-sack]: "Hercules, assembling ships to attack Troy, came and slew Laomedon" (Fabulae §89, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-naming]: "gave the kingdom to his infant son Podarces, who was afterward called apo tou priasthai, 'from being redeemed,' Priam" (Fabulae §89, trans. Mary Grant)

### Priam's Fifty-Five Children (§90)

The Fabulae provides an extensive catalog of Priam's offspring, listing fifty-five "sons and daughters of Priam."[^hyg-number] The list includes the most famous names: "Hector, Deiphobus, Cebriones, Polydorus, Helenus, Alexander, Hippasidus, Antinous, Agathon, Dius, Mestor, Lysides, Polymedon, Ascanius, Chirodamas, Evagoras, Dryops, Astynomus, Polymelus, Laodice, Ethionome, Phegea, Henicea, Demnosia, Cassandra, Philomela, Polites, Troilus, Palaemon, Brissonius, Gorgythion, Protodamas, Aretus, Dolon, Chromius, Eresus, Chrysolaus, Demosthea, Doryclus, Hippasus, Hyperochus, Lysianassa, Iliona, Nereis, Evander, Proneos, Archemachus, Ilagus, Axion, Binates, Hippothous, Deiopites, Medusa, Hero, Creusa."[^hyg-children]

[^hyg-number]: "SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF PRIAM TO THE NUMBER OF LV" (Fabulae §90, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-children]: "Hector, Deiphobus, Cebriones, Polydorus, Helenus, Alexander, Hippasidus, Antinous, Agathon, Dius, Mestor, Lysides, Polymedon, Ascanius, Chirodamas, Evagoras, Dryops, Astynomus, Polymelus, Laodice, Ethionome, Phegea, Henicea, Demnosia, Cassandra, Philomela, Polites, Troilus, Palaemon, Brissonius, Gorgythion, Protodamas, Aretus, Dolon, Chromius, Eresus, Chrysolaus, Demosthea, Doryclus, Hippasus, Hyperochus, Lysianassa, Iliona, Nereis, Evander, Proneos, Archemachus, Ilagus, Axion, Binates, Hippothous, Deiopites, Medusa, Hero, Creusa" (Fabulae §90, trans. Mary Grant)

### Paris's Return to the Palace (§91)

The Fabulae gives the dramatic story of how Paris was recognized and restored to the royal family. After Hecuba's prophetic dream of "giving birth to a glowing firebrand from which many serpents issued," the seers warned that the child would be "the ruin of his country" and advised exposure.[^hyg-dream] "The servants out of pity exposed him. Shepherds found the child, raised him as their own, and named him Paris."[^hyg-shepherds]

Years later, a remarkable coincidence brought Paris back to Troy. Servants were sent "to bring a bull to be given as prize in funeral games in Paris' honor" — games held by the family that believed him dead. Paris followed them to the city: "He, out of fondness for the bull, went down and won everything, even over his own brothers."[^hyg-games]

The victory sparked conflict: "In anger Deiphobus drew his sword against him, but he leaped to the altar of Zeus Herceus."[^hyg-altar] At this moment of crisis, recognition came: "When Cassandra prophetically declared he was her brother, Priam acknowledged him and received him into the palace."[^hyg-return]

[^hyg-dream]: "in a dream saw herself giving birth to a glowing firebrand from which many serpents issued. When this vision was reported to all the seers, they bade her slay whatever child she should bear to avoid its being the ruin of the country" (Fabulae §91, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-shepherds]: "the servants out of pity exposed him. Shepherds found the child, raised him as their own, and named him Paris" (Fabulae §91, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-games]: "servants sent by Priam to bring a bull to be given as prize in funeral games in Paris' honor... He, out of fondness for the bull, went down and won everything, even over his own brothers" (Fabulae §91, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-altar]: "In anger Deiphobus drew his sword against him, but he leaped to the altar of Zeus Herceus" (Fabulae §91, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-return]: "When Cassandra prophetically declared he was her brother, Priam acknowledged him and received him into the palace" (Fabulae §91, trans. Mary Grant)

## In the [Aeneid](../sources/aeneid.md)

### The Death of Priam (2.506-558)

The [Aeneid](../sources/aeneid.md) gives the most detailed account of Priam's death. As Troy fell, Priam donned his armour despite his age: "the old man idly fastens round his aged trembling shoulders his long disused armour, girds on the unavailing sword, and advances on his death among the thronging foe."[^aen-pr-armour] [Hecuba](hecuba.md) tried to dissuade him, drawing him to the altar: "this altar will protect us all, or thou wilt share our death."[^aen-pr-hecuba]

Neoptolemus (Pyrrhus) killed Priam's son Polites before his eyes. Priam hurled a weak spear and rebuked him: "Ah, for thy crime, for this thy hardihood, may the gods, if there is goodness in heaven to care for aught such, pay thee in full thy worthy meed... not such to a foe was the Achilles whose parentage thou beliest; but he revered a suppliant's right and trust, restored to the tomb Hector's pallid corpse, and sent me back to my realm."[^aen-pr-rebuke]

Neoptolemus dragged him "quivering to the very altar, slipping in the pool of his child's blood, and wound his left hand in his hair, while in his right the sword flashed out and plunged to the hilt in his side." Aeneas reflects: "This was the end of Priam's fortunes... once magnificent lord over so many peoples and lands of Asia. The great corpse lies along the shore, a head severed from the shoulders and a body without a name."[^aen-pr-death]

[^aen-pr-armour]: "the old man idly fastens round his aged trembling shoulders his long disused armour, girds on the unavailing sword, and advances on his death among the thronging foe" (Aeneid 2.509-511, trans. J.W. Mackail)

[^aen-pr-death]: "drew him quivering to the very altar, slipping in the pool of his child's blood, and wound his left hand in his hair, while in his right the sword flashed out and plunged to the hilt in his side. This was the end of Priam's fortunes... once magnificent lord over so many peoples and lands of Asia. The great corpse lies along the shore, a head severed from the shoulders and a body without a name" (Aeneid 2.550-558)
