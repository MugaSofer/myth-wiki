## Overview

**Pylades** was the son of Strophius of Phocis and the loyal companion of [Orestes](orestes.md). He was raised alongside Orestes after Strophius took in the exiled prince as a child. Pylades accompanied Orestes in nearly all his adventures—the return to [Argos](../places/argos.md), the matricide, the journey to Tauris—and in some sources married Orestes' sister [Electra](electra.md).

## In the Bibliotheca

[Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) records that Strophius raised Orestes alongside his own son Pylades. The two became companions in all of Orestes' subsequent exploits.[^apd-pylades]

## In Euripides' Orestes

In Euripides' *[Orestes](../sources/euripides-orestes.md)*, Pylades is a major character who stands by Orestes when all others abandon him, declaring he would rather die with his friend than live without him.

## In Euripides' Iphigenia in Tauris

In *[Iphigenia in Tauris](../sources/euripides-iphigenia-tauris.md)*, Pylades accompanies Orestes to the land of the Taurians to steal the sacred image of [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md). When [Iphigenia](iphigenia.md) offers to spare one of them to carry a letter, Orestes and Pylades each insist the other should be saved.

## In Aeschylus' Libation-Bearers

In the *[Libation-Bearers](../sources/aeschylus-libation-bearers.md)*, Pylades accompanies Orestes to [Agamemnon](agamemnon.md)'s tomb and then to the palace disguised as a Phocian traveler. He is a silent presence throughout most of the play, but speaks his only three lines at the decisive moment. When Orestes hesitates before his mother's plea—"Can I my mother spare?"—Pylades replies: "Where then would fall the hest Apollo gave / At Delphi, where the solemn compact sworn? / Choose thou the hate of all men, not of gods."[^lb-pylades]

These lines, concentrated into a single speech after prolonged silence, are among the most dramatically effective in Greek tragedy. They tip the balance and Orestes proceeds with the matricide.
