## Overview

**Adrastus** was a king of [Argos](../places/argos.md) and the principal leader of the expedition of the [Seven Against Thebes](../events/seven-against-thebes.md). Unlike the other six leaders, he was the sole survivor of that disastrous war, a fate attributed to his exceptional piety and the protection of his horse [Arion](../objects/arion.md).

## In the Bibliotheca

Adrastus is introduced as the son of [Talaus](talaus.md), who had "three daughters, Argia, Deipyle, and Aegialia, and two sons, Aegialeus and Cyanippus."[^apd-children]

When [Polynices](polynices.md) arrived at Argos seeking aid, Adrastus remembered a prophecy: he "had been told by a certain seer... to yoke his daughters in marriage to a boar and a lion." When he discovered that Polynices and [Tydeus](tydeus.md) bore these symbols on their shields, he "accepted them both as bridegrooms... And Tydeus married Deipyle, and Polynices married Argia; and Adrastus promised that he would restore them both to their native lands."[^apd-marriage]

### The Seven Against Thebes

Adrastus mustered an army with six other champions: "Having mustered an army with seven leaders, Adrastus hastened to wage war on Thebes."[^apd-army] At the gates of Thebes, "Adrastus was stationed at the Homoloidian gate."[^apd-gate] When the battle turned against the Argives and the other leaders fell, "Adrastus alone was saved by his horse Arion."[^apd-survival]

After the battle's defeat, "Adrastus fled to Athens and took refuge at the altar of Mercy, and laying on it the suppliant's bough he prayed that they would bury the dead."[^apd-athens] The Athenians responded by capturing Thebes and allowing proper burial of the fallen.

### The Epigoni

Ten years later, the sons of the fallen marched again against Thebes. Among the Epigoni was "Aegialeus, son of Adrastus."[^apd-epigoni]
