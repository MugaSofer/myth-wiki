## Overview

**Hyllus** was the eldest son of [Heracles](heracles.md) and Deianira. After his father's death and translation to the gods, he led the Heraclids in their flight from [Eurystheus](eurystheus.md)' persecution, pursued him to the Scironian cliffs and slew him, and later sought to restore the Heraclids to Peloponnese. He was commanded by his dying father to marry [Iole](iole.md).

## Early Life

According to Hesiod's Catalogue of Women, Hyllus was one of the children born to Deianira, who was "subject in love to mighty Heracles." Deianira bore [Heracles](heracles.md) "Hyllus and Glenus and Ctesippus and Odites."[^hesiod-hyllus]

[^hesiod-hyllus]: "wise Deianeira, who was subject in love to mighty Heracles and bare him Hyllus and Glenus and Ctesippus and Odites" (Hesiod Fragments, Catalogue of Women, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## In Apollodorus

### Heracles' Final Charge

When [Heracles](heracles.md) was dying from the poison of Nessus, he charged Hyllus with a sacred duty: "after charging Hyllus his elder son by Deianira, to marry Iole when he came of age, proceeded to Mount Oeta."[^apd-charge]

[^apd-charge]: "Hercules, after charging Hyllus his elder son by Deianira, to marry Iole when he came of age, proceeded to Mount Oeta, in the Trachinian territory, and there constructed a pyre" (Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 2.7.7, trans. J.G. Frazer)

### Flight from Eurystheus

After [Heracles](heracles.md) was translated to the gods, his sons fled from [Eurystheus](eurystheus.md)' persecution. When [Eurystheus](eurystheus.md) demanded their surrender and threatened war, "they were afraid, and, quitting Trachis, fled through Greece."[^apd-flight] The Heraclids came to Athens and claimed protection at the altar of Mercy. The Athenians refused to surrender them and fought [Eurystheus](eurystheus.md), slaying his sons and forcing him to flee.[^apd-athens]

[^apd-flight]: "When Hercules had been translated to the gods, his sons fled from Eurystheus and came to Ceyx. But when Eurystheus demanded their surrender and threatened war, they were afraid, and, quitting Trachis, fled through Greece" (Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 2.8.1, trans. J.G. Frazer)

[^apd-athens]: "Being pursued, they came to Athens, and sitting down on the altar of Mercy, claimed protection. Refusing to surrender them, the Athenians bore the brunt of war with Eurystheus, and slew his sons" (Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 2.8.1, trans. J.G. Frazer)

### Slaying Eurystheus

Hyllus personally pursued [Eurystheus](eurystheus.md) as he fled. "Eurystheus himself fled in a chariot, but was pursued and slain by Hyllus just as he was driving past the Scironian cliffs; and Hyllus cut off his head and gave it to Alcmena; and she gouged out his eyes with weaving-pins."[^apd-eurystheus]

[^apd-eurystheus]: "Eurystheus himself fled in a chariot, but was pursued and slain by Hyllus just as he was driving past the Scironian cliffs; and Hyllus cut off his head and gave it to Alcmena; and she gouged out his eyes with weaving-pins" (Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 2.8.1, trans. J.G. Frazer)

### Marriage to Iole and the Return

After [Eurystheus](eurystheus.md) perished, Hyllus fulfilled his father's command: "Hyllus married Iole according to his father's commands, and sought to effect the return of the Heraclids."[^apd-iole] He went to Delphi to inquire how the Heraclids should return to Peloponnese. The oracle replied that they should await the third crop. Misinterpreting this, Hyllus believed it meant three years and returned with an army. However, at this time [Tisamenus](tisamenus.md), son of [Orestes](orestes.md), was reigning over the Peloponnesians, and the Peloponnesians defeated the Heraclids in battle, and "Aristomachus was slain."[^apd-return]

[^apd-iole]: "Hyllus married Iole according to his father's commands, and sought to effect the return of the Heraclids" (Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 2.8.2, trans. J.G. Frazer)

[^apd-return]: "So he went to Delphi and inquired how they should return; and the god said that they should await the third crop before returning. But Hyllus supposed that the third crop signified three years; and having waited that time he returned with his army...of Hercules to Peloponnese, when Tisamenus, son of Orestes, was reigning over the Peloponnesians" (Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 2.8.2, trans. J.G. Frazer)

## In Euripides' Heraclidae

In the play set after [Heracles](heracles.md)' death, Hyllus and his brothers fled from [Eurystheus](eurystheus.md)' persecution. The chorus mentions that "Hyllus and his brothers, who are older, are seeking where there is a strong-hold that we may inhabit, if we be thrust forth from this land by force."[^euripides-heraclidae]

[^euripides-heraclidae]: "But Hyllus and his brothers, who are older, are seeking where there is a strong-hold that we may inhabit, if we be thrust forth from this land by force" (Euripides, Heraclidae, trans. T.A. Buckley)

Later, a messenger reports that Hyllus offered to settle the dispute through single combat with [Eurystheus](eurystheus.md)' general. The general, however, refused the offer and instead "sacrificed, and delayed not, but let fall forth immediately the propitious slaughter of mortal throats" to proceed to battle.[^euripides-combat] When [Eurystheus](eurystheus.md) was finally captured, the messenger reports: "Hyllus, therefore, and the good Iolaus, have set up a statue, in honor of their victory, of Jove, the putter to flight."[^euripides-victory]

[^euripides-combat]: "Hyllus then returned again back to his ranks; but the soothsayers, when they saw that the affair could not be arranged by single combat of one shield, sacrificed, and delayed not, but let fall forth immediately the propitious slaughter of mortal throats" (Euripides, Heraclidae, trans. T.A. Buckley)

[^euripides-victory]: "Hyllus, therefore, and the good Iolaus, have set up a statue, in honor of their victory, of Jove, the putter to flight" (Euripides, Heraclidae, trans. T.A. Buckley)

## In Hyginus

According to Hyginus, Hyllus was the first-listed son of [Heracles](heracles.md) among his many children: "Hyllus by Dejanira."[^hyginus-hyllus]

[^hyginus-hyllus]: "SONS OF HERCULES: Hyllus by Dejanira" (Hyginus, Fabulae §162, trans. Mary Grant)
