## Overview

**Electra** was a daughter of [Agamemnon](agamemnon.md) and [Clytemnestra](clytemnestra.md), sister of [Orestes](orestes.md) and [Iphigenia](iphigenia.md). After her father's murder, she saved the infant Orestes by smuggling him away to be raised in safety. When he returned as a man to avenge their father, she aided him. Her name became synonymous with devoted mourning and filial loyalty.

## In the Bibliotheca

[Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) records that after Agamemnon's murder, "Electra, one of Agamemnon's daughters, smuggled away her brother Orestes and gave him to Strophius, the Phocian, to bring up."[^apd-rescue]

## In the Fabulae

[Hyginus](../sources/hyginus.md) gives the same account: "Electra, Agamemnon's daughter, rescued her brother, the infant Orestes, and sent him to Strophius in Phocis."[^hyg-rescue]

## In Euripides' Orestes

In Euripides' *[Orestes](../sources/euripides-orestes.md)*, Electra is a major character who tends her brother during his madness after the matricide and participates in the plot against [Helen](helen.md) and [Hermione](hermione.md).

## In Aeschylus' Libation-Bearers

Electra's most developed Aeschylean portrayal is in the *[Libation-Bearers](../sources/aeschylus-libation-bearers.md)*. She accompanies the Chorus of captive women to Agamemnon's tomb, bearing libations sent by [Clytemnestra](clytemnestra.md) after a terrifying dream. Electra agonizes over how to pour the offerings: "Shall I aver, Behold, I bear these gifts / From well-beloved wife unto her well-beloved lord, / When 'tis from her, my mother, that they come?"[^lb-dilemma]

### Recognition of Orestes

At the tomb, Electra discovers a freshly shorn lock of hair that matches her own: "in truth the hair exceeding like" her father's children's hair. She then finds footprints matching hers: "these footsteps, look, / Like to my own, a corresponsive print."[^lb-footprints] When [Orestes](orestes.md) reveals himself, she is cautious—"Some fraud, O stranger, weavest thou for me?"—but is convinced by the matching lock, footprints, and a robe she once wove.[^lb-fraud]

### The Invocation

In the great kommos at Agamemnon's tomb, Electra joins Orestes and the Chorus in calling on the dead king's spirit for aid. She describes her own degradation: "I was thrust from his side, / As a dog from the chamber they thrust me away, / And in place of my laughter rose sobbing and tears."[^lb-dog] She addresses her father as the last hope of the house: "Lo! at thy tomb, two fledglings of thy brood— / A man-child and a maid."[^lb-fledglings]

She calls upon [Persephone](../deities/persephone.md) for aid: "Give fair-faced fortune, O Persephone!"[^lb-persephone]

## In Sophocles' Electra

In [Sophocles](../sources/sophocles-electra.md)' tragedy, Electra is the central figure. The play opens with her lament: "O purest light! And air by earth alone measured and limitable."[^soph-el-opening] She addresses [Hades](../deities/hades.md), [Persephone](../deities/persephone.md), [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md), the Curse, and the [Erinyes](../creatures/erinyes.md), calling on them to send Orestes home.

### Life as a Slave in Her Father's House

Electra describes her existence under [Clytemnestra](clytemnestra.md) and [Aegisthus](aegisthus.md) in stark terms: "like a sojourner all unregarded at slave-like labour unrewarded I toil within my father's hall thus meanly attired, and starved, a table-serving thrall."[^soph-el-slave] She watches Aegisthus sit on Agamemnon's throne and wear his robes. She refuses to stop mourning her father, though Clytemnestra celebrates the monthly anniversary of the murder with feasting. She also compares herself to the nightingale ceaselessly mourning Itys.

### The Debate with Clytemnestra

When Clytemnestra confronts Electra and justifies the killing of Agamemnon — because he sacrificed Iphigenia for the sake of Menelaus's war — Electra retorts that Agamemnon acted under compulsion from [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md), and that Clytemnestra's real motive was Aegisthus. She warns that if blood for blood is law, Clytemnestra herself should be the next to die.

### The Resolve to Act Alone

When a false report of Orestes' death arrives, Electra determines to kill Aegisthus herself. She urges her sister [Chrysothemis](chrysothemis.md) to join her, but Chrysothemis refuses. Electra declares: "I, all alone and with a single hand, must do this. For it shall not rest undone."[^soph-el-alone]

### The Urn Scene and Recognition

Orestes arrives carrying an urn that supposedly holds his ashes. Electra takes it and laments over it: "How cold in this thy welcome is the hope wherein I decked thee as I sent thee forth!"[^soph-el-urn] She recalls nursing him as a child, being called "sister, sister" by him, and begs to be enclosed in the urn. Orestes, overcome, reveals himself by showing their father's signet ring.

### During the Matricide

While Orestes and [Pylades](pylades.md) enter the palace to kill Clytemnestra, Electra stands at the door. When Clytemnestra's cry is heard — "O son, have pity! Pity the womb that bare thee" — Electra answers: "Thou hadst none for him, nor for his father, in that day."[^soph-el-pity] When Clytemnestra cries out that she has been struck, Electra calls back: "Give a second stroke, if thou hast power."[^soph-el-strike]

## In Euripides' [Electra](../sources/euripides-electra.md)

Euripides' [Electra](../sources/euripides-electra.md) gives the most psychologically searching portrait of the character. She has been married by [Aegisthus](aegisthus.md) to a poor peasant farmer to prevent her bearing a son of noble blood. The Peasant has never consummated the marriage out of respect for her royal blood — "never yet these arms have clasped her body, and she goes a virgin still."[^eur-el-virgin]

### Poverty and Bitterness

Electra carries water at dawn and insists on labouring, though the Peasant begs her to rest. She details her humiliations: she weaves her own garments, is excluded from festivals, and while [Clytemnestra](clytemnestra.md) sits surrounded by Trojan spoils, [Agamemnon](agamemnon.md)'s grave lies unadorned. Aegisthus leaps on it when drunk, crying: "Where is thy son Orestes? Doth he give thy tomb good tendance?"[^eur-el-grave]

### Recognition and the Subversion of Aeschylus

When an Old Man suggests matching hair and footprints found at Agamemnon's tomb, Electra dismisses each token — a man's hair cannot match a woman's, stone takes no footprint, and childhood garments do not grow with the wearer. Instead, the Old Man recognises [Orestes](orestes.md) by a childhood scar: "There, by his brow, I see the scar he made, that day he ran with thee chasing thy fawn, and fell."[^eur-el-scar]

### Driving the Revenge

Electra devises the plot to kill Clytemnestra. She sends word that she has borne a child, knowing her mother will come. When Orestes hesitates before the matricide — "'Twas she that bare my body into life. She gave me suck. How can I strike her?" — and questions [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md)'s oracle ("How if some fiend of Hell, hid in God's likeness, spake that oracle?"), Electra is relentless: "Strike her as she struck our father!"[^eur-el-strike]

### Speech Over Aegisthus

She delivers a long tirade over Aegisthus's corpse, mocking him as "the Queen's husband" rather than "the King," despising his vanity ("that girl-like face!"), and warning: "O vaunt not, if one step be proudly made in evil, that all Justice is o'ercast."[^eur-el-speech]

### The Aftermath

After the matricide, Electra is shattered. She describes her mother's hand clinging to her cheek: "She stretched her hand to my cheek, and there brake from her lips a moan; 'Mercy, my child, my own!' Her hand clung to my cheek; clung, and my arm was weak; and the sword fell and was gone."[^eur-el-hand] She claims the blame: "Let tear rain upon tear, brother: but mine is the blame."[^eur-el-blame]

[Castor](castor.md) decrees that Electra shall marry [Pylades](pylades.md) and leave Argos. She laments that exile is a "bitter judgment." In a wrenching farewell, she and Orestes embrace and part, knowing they will never see each other again.[^eur-el-farewell]
