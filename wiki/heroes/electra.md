## Overview

**Electra** was a daughter of [Agamemnon](agamemnon.md) and [Clytemnestra](clytemnestra.md), sister of [Orestes](orestes.md) and [Iphigenia](iphigenia.md). After her father's murder, she saved the infant Orestes by smuggling him away to be raised in safety. When he returned as a man to avenge their father, she aided him. Her name became synonymous with devoted mourning and filial loyalty.

## In the Bibliotheca

[Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) records that after Agamemnon's murder, "Electra, one of Agamemnon's daughters, smuggled away her brother Orestes and gave him to Strophius, the Phocian, to bring up."[^apd-rescue]

## In the Fabulae

[Hyginus](../sources/hyginus.md) gives the same account: "Electra, Agamemnon's daughter, rescued her brother, the infant Orestes, and sent him to Strophius in Phocis."[^hyg-rescue]

## In Euripides' Orestes

In Euripides' *[Orestes](../sources/euripides-orestes.md)*, Electra is a major character who tends her brother during his madness after the matricide and participates in the plot against [Helen](helen.md) and [Hermione](hermione.md).

## In Aeschylus' Libation-Bearers

Electra's most developed Aeschylean portrayal is in the *[Libation-Bearers](../sources/aeschylus-libation-bearers.md)*. She accompanies the Chorus of captive women to Agamemnon's tomb, bearing libations sent by [Clytemnestra](clytemnestra.md) after a terrifying dream. Electra agonizes over how to pour the offerings: "Shall I aver, Behold, I bear these gifts / From well-beloved wife unto her well-beloved lord, / When 'tis from her, my mother, that they come?"[^lb-dilemma]

### Recognition of Orestes

At the tomb, Electra discovers a freshly shorn lock of hair that matches her own: "in truth the hair exceeding like" her father's children's hair. She then finds footprints matching hers: "these footsteps, look, / Like to my own, a corresponsive print."[^lb-footprints] When [Orestes](orestes.md) reveals himself, she is cautious—"Some fraud, O stranger, weavest thou for me?"—but is convinced by the matching lock, footprints, and a robe she once wove.[^lb-fraud]

### The Invocation

In the great kommos at Agamemnon's tomb, Electra joins Orestes and the Chorus in calling on the dead king's spirit for aid. She describes her own degradation: "I was thrust from his side, / As a dog from the chamber they thrust me away, / And in place of my laughter rose sobbing and tears."[^lb-dog] She addresses her father as the last hope of the house: "Lo! at thy tomb, two fledglings of thy brood— / A man-child and a maid."[^lb-fledglings]

She calls upon [Persephone](../deities/persephone.md) for aid: "Give fair-faced fortune, O Persephone!"[^lb-persephone]
