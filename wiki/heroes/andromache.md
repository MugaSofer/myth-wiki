## Overview

**Andromache** was the wife of [Hector](hector.md), the greatest warrior of [Troy](../places/troy.md), and daughter of Eetion, king of Thebes-under-Plakos in Cilicia. Her life is defined by successive devastating losses: [Achilles](achilles.md) killed her father and all seven of her brothers at Thebes, then killed her husband Hector before Troy's walls, and after the sack of Troy her infant son [Astyanax](astyanax.md) was hurled from the walls. She was taken as a captive concubine by Achilles' son [Neoptolemus](neoptolemus.md).

## In the Iliad

### Farewell to Hector (Book VI)

The scene at the Scaean Gates is the Iliad's most extended portrait of Andromache. She met Hector as he returned to Troy, accompanied by a handmaid carrying their infant son Astyanax (also called Scamandrios). She pleaded with him not to return to battle: "But, Hector, thou art to me father and mother and brother, and thou art my stalwart husband. Come now, have pity and abide here upon the tower, lest thou make thy child an orphan and thy wife a widow."[^il6-plead]

She recounted how Achilles had already destroyed everything else she had: "Achilles slew my father, and spoiled the well-peopled city of the Kilikians, even Thebe of the lofty gates. He slew Eetion, yet despoiled him not, for he had him in his heart; so he burnt him with his inlaid armour, and reared a barrow over him." All seven brothers had been slain by Achilles in a single day: "and my seven brothers, all went down to the house of Hades in one day." Her mother, who had been ransomed, had died shortly after: "Artemis of the golden arrows slew her in the halls."[^il6-family]

She declared that Hector was her entire world: "thou Hector art to me husband and brother and blooming son."[^il6-all] Hector's reply acknowledged Troy's coming fall and his deepest anxiety — that she would be enslaved: "doth the anguish of the Trojans hereafter not so much trouble me [...] as doth thine anguish in the day when some mail-clad Achaian shall lead thee weeping and rob thee of the light of freedom."[^il6-anguish] He prayed their son would surpass even him in greatness.

[^il6-plead]: "But, Hector, thou art to me father and mother and brother, and thou art my stalwart husband. Come now, have pity and abide here upon the tower, lest thou make thy child an orphan and thy wife a widow" (Iliad 6.429-432, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il6-family]: "Achilles slew my father, and spoiled the well-peopled city of the Kilikians, even Thebe of the lofty gates... and my seven brothers, all went down to the house of Hades in one day... Artemis of the golden arrows slew her in the halls" (Iliad 6.414-428)
[^il6-all]: "thou Hector art to me husband and brother and blooming son" (Iliad 6.429-430)
[^il6-anguish]: "doth the anguish of the Trojans hereafter not so much trouble me [...] as doth thine anguish in the day when some mail-clad Achaian shall lead thee weeping and rob thee of the light of freedom" (Iliad 6.450-454)

### Lament for Hector (Book XXII)

When she heard the wailing from the walls after Hector's death, Andromache rushed out "like to one mad, with beating heart, and her handmaidens went with her."[^il22-rush] She caught her first glimpse of Hector's body being dragged by Achilles' chariot around the city: "she beheld her husband borne before the city, and swift horses dragged him recklessly toward the hollow ships of the Achaeans."[^il22-behold]

She fainted — "night veiled her eyes, and she fell backward and gasped forth her spirit" — and her head-dress scattered: "the bright frontlet and the coif and the woven snood and the veil which golden Aphrodite gave her on the day when Hector of the glancing helm led her forth from the house of Eetion."[^il22-faint] When she recovered, she lamented, foreseeing Astyanax's fate as an orphan: "the child is yet but a little one, born of thee and me, ill-fated; him thou didst not protect in dying, Hector, nor he thee. And now by the beaked ships, far from thy parents, will the writhing worms consume thee."[^il22-child]

She mourned most for Astyanax's future: the boy who had sat on his father's knee eating marrow and fat, who would now beg at others' tables, who would be mocked and driven away, who had no father to plead for him: "the boy will not be among the foremost till he have come to the measure of his youth."[^il22-future]

[^il22-rush]: "like to one mad, with beating heart, and her handmaidens went with her" (Iliad 22.460-461, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il22-behold]: "she beheld her husband borne before the city, and swift horses dragged him recklessly toward the hollow ships of the Achaeans" (Iliad 22.463-465)
[^il22-faint]: "night veiled her eyes, and she fell backward and gasped forth her spirit... And off her head fell the bright frontlet and the coif and the woven snood and the veil which golden Aphrodite gave her on the day when Hector of the glancing helm led her forth from the house of Eetion" (Iliad 22.466-472)
[^il22-child]: "the child is yet but a little one, born of thee and me, ill-fated; him thou didst not protect in dying, Hector, nor he thee. And now by the beaked ships, far from thy parents, will the writhing worms consume thee" (Iliad 22.484-487)
[^il22-future]: "the boy will not be among the foremost till he have come to the measure of his youth" (Iliad 22.503-504)

### Lament at Hector's Funeral (Book XXIV)

At Hector's funeral, Andromache led the formal lament, speaking first: "Husband, thou art gone from life in youth, and leavest me a widow in thy halls. The boy is yet a little child, the child of thee and me, ill-fated; nor do I think he will come to manhood; for ere then shall this city be utterly laid waste."[^il24-lament]

She focused again on Astyanax's bleak future without a father to protect him: "for either they will slay him with them at the ships, being wroth for a kinsman, or else he will touch the hands of an Achaean, and will be hurled from a tower in his bitterness, because Hector once slew his sire."[^il24-astyanax]

[^il24-lament]: "Husband, thou art gone from life in youth, and leavest me a widow in thy halls. The boy is yet a little child, the child of thee and me, ill-fated; nor do I think he will come to manhood; for ere then shall this city be utterly laid waste" (Iliad 24.725-728, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il24-astyanax]: "for either they will slay him with them at the ships, being wroth for a kinsman, or else he will touch the hands of an Achaean, and will be hurled from a tower in his bitterness, because Hector once slew his sire" (Iliad 24.734-738)

## In the Bibliotheca

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) records that [Hector](hector.md) "married Andromache, daughter of Eetion."[^apd-marriage] After the fall of Troy, in the division of spoils, "Neoptolemus got Andromache."[^apd-spoils] He subsequently "begat Molossus on Andromache" while ruling as king of the Molossians.[^apd-molossus]

[^apd-marriage]: "Hector married Andromache, daughter of Eetion" (Bibliotheca 3.12.6, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-spoils]: "Neoptolemus got Andromache" (Bibliotheca E.5.23, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-molossus]: "having vanquished the Molossians in battle he reigned as king and begat Molossus on Andromache" (Bibliotheca E.6.12, trans. J.G. Frazer)

## In the Posthomerica

### Lament After Achilles' Death (Book III)

In the [Posthomerica](../sources/posthomerica.md), Andromache appears among the captive women who mourn Achilles after his death. She and the other Trojan captive-maids — women Achilles had taken as prizes when he ravaged Lemnos and Thebes — gathered around his body and wailed, "as they stood and rent their fair young flesh, and smote their breasts, and from their hearts bemoaned that lord of gentleness and courtesy, who honoured even the daughters of his foes."[^post-captives]

Quintus's presentation is striking: even Achilles' captive women mourned him, implicitly including Andromache, who had lost her father Eetion and brothers to the same man. The poet notes that Achilles had honoured "the daughters of his foes" — a pointed phrase given Andromache's presence among them.

[^post-captives]: "Around him all the woeful captive-maids, whom he had taken for a prey, what time he had ravaged hallowed Lemnos, and had scaled the towered crags of Thebes, Eetion's town, wailed, as they stood and rent their fair young flesh, and smote their breasts, and from their hearts bemoaned that lord of gentleness and courtesy, who honoured even the daughters of his foes" (Posthomerica 3.2929-2936, trans. A.S. Way)

### Capture During the Sack of Troy (Book XIII)

During the sack of [Troy](../places/troy.md), Astyanax was torn from Andromache's arms by the Danaans and hurled from the city walls, "dashing him out of life. They tore the child out of his mother's arms, in wrathful hate of Hector, who in life had dealt to them such havoc."[^post-astyanax]

At the same moment she was herself seized and dragged into captivity. Witnessing the murders of husband, father, and son — "three fearful deaths" — she cried out for her own death: "Oh hurl my body also from the wall, or down the cliff, or cast me midst the fire, ye Argives! Woes are mine unutterable! For Peleus' son smote down my noble father in Thebe, and in Troy mine husband slew... Hale me not overseas mingled with spear-thralls; for my soul henceforth hath no more pleasure in life, since God hath slain my nearest and my dearest!"[^post-andromache-cry]

The Posthomerica narrator names her origin explicitly as "that shrieking daughter of King Eetion," taken into bondage despite her prayers for death.[^post-eetion]

[^post-astyanax]: "Yea, also did those Danaan car-lords hurl from a high tower the babe Astyanax, dashing him out of life. They tore the child out of his mother's arms, in wrathful hate of Hector, who in life had dealt to them such havoc" (Posthomerica 13.9672-9678, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post-andromache-cry]: "'Oh hurl my body also from the wall, or down the cliff, or cast me midst the fire, ye Argives! Woes are mine unutterable! For Peleus' son smote down my noble father in Thebe, and in Troy mine husband slew, who unto me was all mine heart's desire, who left me in mine halls one little child, my darling and my pride... Hale me not overseas mingled with spear-thralls; for my soul henceforth hath no more pleasure in life, since God hath slain my nearest and my dearest!'" (Posthomerica 13.9695-9710, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post-eetion]: "to bondage haled with other captive thralls that shrieking daughter of King Eetion" (Posthomerica 13.9688-9689, trans. A.S. Way)

### Assigned to Neoptolemus (Book XIV)

After the sack, in the distribution of captives, "to Achilles' son Andromache had fallen."[^post-assigned] She is listed alongside Cassandra (given to [Agamemnon](agamemnon.md)) and [Hecuba](hecuba.md) (dragged by Odysseus) as among the most notable captive women. In the Posthomerica account, Achilles' ghost demanded the sacrifice of [Polyxena](polyxena.md) from his son — Neoptolemus carried out the sacrifice, then prepared to sail with Andromache among his captives.[^post-neopt]

[^post-assigned]: "to Achilles' son Andromache had fallen" (Posthomerica 14.10057-10058, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post-neopt]: Posthomerica 14.10057-10058, 10380-10406: distribution of captives; sacrifice of Polyxena; preparation for departure

## In Euripides' Trojan Women

### Arrival and the Death of Polyxena

Andromache arrives on a Greek chariot heaped with spoils, holding [Astyanax](astyanax.md) in her arms. The Chorus leader describes the scene: "Lo, yonder on the heapèd crest / Of a Greek wain, Andromachê... on her wave-borne breast / Her loved one clingeth, Hector's child, / Astyanax."[^tw-arrival]

Speaking with [Hecuba](hecuba.md), Andromache reveals what Talthybius had obscured — that [Polyxena](polyxena.md) has been sacrificed on [Achilles](achilles.md)' tomb: "Polyxena across Achilles' tomb / Lies slain, a gift flung to the dreamless dead."[^tw-polyxena] She adds: "I saw her lie, and stayed this chariot; / And raiment wrapt on her dead limbs, and beat / My breast for her."[^tw-polyxena-2]

### Death vs. Slavery

Andromache and Hecuba debate whether death or slavery is worse. Andromache argues for death's superiority: "To die is only not to be; / And better to be dead than grievously / Living. They have no pain, they ponder not / Their own wrong."[^tw-death] Hecuba insists death "cannot be what Life is... the cup / Of Death is empty, and Life hath always hope."[^tw-hope]

### Virtue and Its Consequences

Andromache gives a long speech on how her very virtue — her devotion to modesty, silence, and [Hector](hector.md) — has become the cause of her downfall. She had never roamed abroad, had kept silent at home, had brought Hector "fair silence and a tranquil eye": "And, lo! some rumour of this peace, being gone / Forth to the Greek, hath cursed me. Achilles' son, / So soon as I was taken, for his thrall / Chose me."[^tw-virtue] Now she faces an impossible choice between loyalty to Hector's memory and submission to her new master [Neoptolemus](neoptolemus.md): "How? Shall I thrust aside / Hector's beloved face, and open wide / My heart to this new lord? Oh, I should stand / A traitor to the dead."[^tw-traitor]

### The Death Sentence for Astyanax

[Talthybius](talthybius.md) returns with news that Odysseus has prevailed in council: Astyanax must die, lest the son of so dangerous a father grow to manhood. He reports the decree: "That the son / Of one so perilous be not fostered on / To manhood — / ... But from this crested wall / Of Troy be dashed, and die."[^tw-sentence]

### Farewell to Astyanax

Andromache's farewell to her son is the emotional centrepiece of the scene. She begs him to kiss her, knowing it is the last time, and addresses him directly: "Go, die, my best-beloved, my cherished one, / In fierce men's hands, leaving me here alone. / Thy father was too valiant; that is why / They slay thee! Other children, like to die, / Might have been spared for that. But on thy head / His good is turned to evil."[^tw-farewell] She then is set back on the chariot and driven toward the ships, while Talthybius takes the child.

[^tw-arrival]: "Lo, yonder on the heapèd crest / Of a Greek wain, Andromachê, / As one that o'er an unknown sea / Tosseth; and on her wave-borne breast / Her loved one clingeth, Hector's child, / Astyanax" (Trojan Women, trans. Gilbert Murray)

## In Euripides' [Andromache](../sources/euripides-andromache.md)

### Persecution by Hermione

In the *Andromache*, set after the [Trojan War](../events/trojan-war.md), Andromache is [Neoptolemus](neoptolemus.md)'s concubine and has borne him a son, Molossus. [Neoptolemus](neoptolemus.md) is absent, having gone to [Delphi](../places/delphi.md) to atone for previously demanding [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) compensate him for [Achilles](achilles.md)' death. In his absence, [Hermione](hermione.md) — Neoptolemus's barren wife — persecutes Andromache, accusing her of using drugs to cause barrenness: "thy drugs have made me odious."[^eur-andr-drugs] She insults Andromache for sleeping with the son of her husband's killer: "thou dar'st to sleep e'en with the son of him who slew thy husband."[^eur-andr-insult]

Andromache has taken sanctuary at [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md)'s temple, having secretly sent Molossus away and dispatched messengers to [Peleus](peleus.md) for help. She responds to Hermione with dignity, arguing that Hermione's barrenness comes from her own character, not magic: "Not beauty, but the virtues, O woman, to the partners of our bed afford delight."[^eur-andr-virtue]

### Menelaus's Coercion

[Menelaus](menelaus.md) arrives with the captured Molossus and forces Andromache to choose: die herself and save the child, or watch him killed. Andromache delivers a scathing speech denouncing Menelaus's fame as hollow — he destroyed [Troy](../places/troy.md) over a worthless woman, yet bullies a helpless captive. She leaves the altar to save her son, but Menelaus immediately betrays the deal, declaring he will kill both.[^eur-andr-betray]

### Rescue and Prophecy

[Peleus](peleus.md) arrives and rescues Andromache and Molossus. At the play's end, [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md) appears as deus ex machina and prophesies Andromache's future: she must marry [Helenus](helenus.md) and settle in Molossia, where Molossus will found a dynasty: "from him in long succession shall a race of happy kings Molossia's sceptre wield."[^eur-andr-prophecy]

[^eur-andr-drugs]: "thy drugs have made me odious" (Andromache, trans. Michael Wodhull)
[^eur-andr-insult]: "thou dar'st to sleep e'en with the son of him who slew thy husband" (Andromache, trans. Michael Wodhull)
[^eur-andr-virtue]: "Not beauty, but the virtues, O woman, to the partners of our bed afford delight" (Andromache, trans. Michael Wodhull)
[^eur-andr-betray]: "I proposed to slay your son, that you might leave that hallowed altar of Thetis, and thus craftily induced you to fall into my hands" (Andromache, trans. Michael Wodhull)
[^eur-andr-prophecy]: "from him in long succession shall a race of happy kings Molossia's sceptre wield" (Andromache, trans. Michael Wodhull)

## Variant Traditions

The fate of Astyanax differs in detail between sources. In the [Posthomerica](../sources/posthomerica.md), it is "those Danaan car-lords" collectively who throw him from the wall while Andromache watches. In the [Epic Cycle](../sources/epic-cycle.md) (Little Iliad), it is specifically [Neoptolemus](neoptolemus.md) who kills him. The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) records that "Neoptolemus slew Astyanax" (E.5.23) without specifying the method; Hyginus (Fabulae 109) also attributes the killing to Neoptolemus.
