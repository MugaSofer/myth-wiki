## Overview

**Narcissus** was a youth of extraordinary beauty, born of the river god Cephissus and the nymph Liriope. The blind prophet [Tiresias](tiresias.md) foretold that he would live long only "if he but fail to recognize himself." He rejected all lovers, including the nymph Echo, and ultimately wasted away gazing at his own reflection in a pool, transforming into the flower that bears his name.

### Tiresias's Prophecy

Narcissus's story is the first confirmation of [Tiresias](tiresias.md)'s prophetic power. Liriope came to the seer and asked whether her son "might attain a ripe old age." Tiresias answered cryptically: "If he but fail to recognize himself, a long life he may have, beneath the sun." The words seemed "frivolous" at first, "and yet the event, the manner of his death, the strange delusion of his frenzied love, confirmed it."[^met-narcissus-1]

### Echo's Rejection

Echo was a nymph cursed by [Hera](../deities/hera.md) for distracting the goddess with endless talk while [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md)'s other lovers escaped. Hera decreed: "Your tongue, so freely wagged at my expense, shall be of little use; your endless voice, much shorter than your tongue."[^met-narcissus-2] Thereafter Echo could only repeat the last words spoken to her.

When she saw Narcissus wandering in the woods, she followed him with burning love. Their exchange is one of Ovid's most poignant sequences: when Narcissus called "Who is here?" Echo answered "Here!" When he cried "Oh let us come together!" she rushed from the woods to embrace him. But he fled: "Take off your hands! you shall not fold your arms around me. Better death than such a one should ever caress me!"[^met-narcissus-3] Echo faded away in grief until "nothing remains except her bones and voice — her voice continues, in the wilderness; her bones have turned to stone."[^met-narcissus-4]

### Nemesis Answers

A youth whom Narcissus had despised prayed to the gods: "If he should love deny him what he loves!" Nemesis granted the prayer.[^met-narcissus-5]

### The Pool

At a silver-clear fountain, Narcissus stooped to drink and "beholds himself reflected in the mirrored pool — and loves; loves an imagined body which contains no substance." He lay "with countenance unchanged, as if indeed a statue carved of Parian marble," gazing at "his own eyes, twin stars; his fingers shaped as Bacchus might desire, his flowing hair as glorious as Apollo's."[^met-narcissus-6]

### The Recognition

The long monologue at the pool traces his growing awareness. At first he believed the reflection was another person: "Surely he desires my love and my embraces, for as oft I strive to kiss him... so often does he hold his face fondly to me." But recognition came at last: "No more my shade deceives me, I perceive 'tis I in thee — I love myself — the flame arises in my breast and burns my heart." His paradox was absolute: "abundance makes me poor... I wish the object of my love away."[^met-narcissus-7]

### Transformation

Narcissus wasted away "by love consumed, and slowly wasted by a hidden flame." Echo, though still angry at his rejection, grieved. When he sighed "farewell," Echo returned "Farewell!" His last gaze was into the pool. "And now although among the nether shades his sad sprite roams, he ever loves to gaze on his reflection in the Stygian wave."[^met-narcissus-8] Where his body had lain, the nymphs found "a sweet flower grew, golden and white, the white around the gold."[^met-narcissus-9]
