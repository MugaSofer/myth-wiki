## Overview

**Atreus** was the son of [Pelops](pelops.md) and king of Mycenae, whose rivalry with his brother [Thyestes](thyestes.md) produced one of Greek mythology's most notorious crimes: the slaughter of Thyestes' children and their serving at a feast. Through [Agamemnon](agamemnon.md) and [Menelaus](menelaus.md), his line was central to the [Trojan War](../sources/apollodorus.md) and its aftermath, and the curse on the House of Atreus drove events across multiple generations.

## In the Iliad

Atreus appears in the lineage of the divine sceptre: [Hephaestus](../deities/hephaestus.md) forged it for [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md), who gave it to [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md), then to Pelops, then to "Atreus shepherd of the host. And Atreus dying left it to Thyestes rich in flocks, and Thyestes in his turn left it to Agamemnon to bear, that over many islands and all Argos he should be lord."[^il2-sceptre]

## In the Bibliotheca

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) tells the full story of the brothers' rivalry. Atreus had vowed to sacrifice his finest lamb to [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md), but when a golden lamb appeared in his flock, he kept it.[^apd-lamb] Thyestes seduced Atreus's wife Aerope and gained possession of the golden lamb through her. When Thyestes used this to claim the throne, Zeus intervened: he "sent Hermes to Atreus and told him to stipulate with Thyestes that Atreus should be king if the sun should go backward; and when Thyestes agreed, the sun set in the east."[^apd-sun]

Atreus then took terrible revenge. He "slaughtered the sons, Aglaus, Callileon, and Orchomenus... And having cut them limb from limb and boiled them, he served them up to Thyestes without the extremities; and when Thyestes had eaten heartily of them, he showed him the extremities."[^apd-feast]

Atreus was eventually killed by [Aegisthus](aegisthus.md), Thyestes' son by his own daughter Pelopia. Aegisthus had been raised by Atreus as his own child but, on learning his true parentage, slew him.[^apd-death]

## In Aeschylus' Agamemnon

[Cassandra](cassandra.md), in her prophetic frenzy, sees the ghosts of Thyestes' children: their "hands are full / Of their own flesh," served as meat by Atreus.[^ag-cassandra]

[Aegisthus](aegisthus.md) tells the story more fully when he enters to gloat over [Agamemnon](agamemnon.md)'s corpse. Atreus "feigned to hold in loyal joy a day of festal cheer" and set before Thyestes "flesh that was his children once." When Thyestes discovered what he had eaten, "with horror's bitter cry back-starting, spewing forth the fragments foul, on Pelops' house a deadly curse he spake."[^ag-feast]

## In Euripides' Orestes

The Chorus traces the full curse from [Tantalus](../sources/apollodorus.md) through Pelops to Atreus, singing of "the strife of the golden lamb" and the feast of Thyestes that brought the reversal of the sun.[^or-curse]
