## Overview

**Philemon** and **Baucis** are an elderly married couple in Phrygia who alone offered hospitality to [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) and [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md) when the gods traveled in disguise. Their story, told in the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md), is a parable of [xenia](../concepts/xenia.md) (guest-friendship) and piety rewarded.

### The Disguised Gods (8.611-678)

The story is told by Lelex to [Theseus](theseus.md) at the house of the river-god Achelous. [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) and [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md), traveling as weary mortals (Hermes "had laid aside his rod and wings"), wandered begging for food and shelter. "Of a thousand houses, all the doors were bolted and no word of kindness given — so wicked were the people of that land."[^met-phil-reject]

At last they reached a small thatched cottage where Baucis and Philemon lived: "they had been married in their early youth, in that same cottage and had lived in it, and grown together to a good old age; contented with their lot because they knew their poverty, and felt no shame of it."[^met-phil-couple]

The old couple served their best — cabbage, a little bacon "cherished long," olives, eggs turned in embers, wine in clay cups, nuts, figs, dates, and a honeycomb. Baucis "whose skirts were tucked up, moving carefully, for so she tottered with her many years" even tried to wedge a short table-leg with a potsherd.[^met-phil-meal]

### The Miracle of the Wine (8.678-692)

The wine-bowl, "often drained, as often was replenished, though unfilled." Recognizing their guests as gods, Baucis and Philemon tried to sacrifice their only goose — "the faithful guardian of their little home" — but it fled to the gods, who forbade the killing.[^met-phil-wine]

### The Flood and the Temple (8.693-704)

The gods led the couple up the mountain, saying "a righteous punishment shall fall severe upon this wicked neighborhood." Looking back, they saw all the land engulfed in a morass — "although their own remained." Their small house "put on new splendor" and transformed into a temple: "columns of marble glistened, and the thatch gleamed golden in the sun."[^met-phil-temple]

### Their Wish (8.705-724)

When Zeus asked their desire, Philemon and Baucis asked two things: to be keepers of the temple, and "since we have passed so many years in harmony, let us depart this life together — Let the same hour take us both — I would not see the tomb of my dear wife; and let me not be destined to be buried by her hands!"[^met-phil-wish]

In old age, standing before the temple steps, "Baucis saw Philemon, her old husband, and he, too, saw Baucis, as their bodies put forth leaves; and while the tops of trees grew over them, above their faces, — they spoke each to each; as long as they could speak they said, 'Farewell, farewell, my own' — and while they said farewell; new leaves and branches covered both at once." They became two trees from a double trunk — a lime and an oak — still standing with votive wreaths hung from their branches.[^met-phil-trees]
