## Overview

**Dolon** was a Trojan who volunteered to spy on the Greek camp during a night of crisis in the [Trojan War](../events/trojan-war.md). He was intercepted by [Odysseus](odysseus.md) and [Diomedes](diomedes.md), revealed the Trojans' positions and the location of [Rhesus](rhesus.md)'s camp, and was killed.

## In the Iliad

### The Spy Mission (Book X)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book X, [Hector](hector.md) calls for a volunteer to spy on the Greek fleet. Dolon volunteers, demanding as his reward "the chariot and the bronze-shod horses of the blameless son of Peleus."[^il10-reward] Hector swears to give them. Dolon sets out armed with a bow and wearing a cap of ferret-skin and a grey wolf-skin.[^il10-disguise]

### Capture and Death (Book X)

Odysseus and Diomedes spot Dolon and pursue him. Caught, Dolon begs for his life and offers ransom: "alive take me, and I will ransom myself; for within our house there is bronze, and gold, and smithied iron."[^il10-ransom] He reveals everything — the watchwords, the positions of the Trojan allies, and most importantly, the location of the newly arrived [Rhesus](rhesus.md) and his magnificent horses on the outermost flank. Despite his plea, Diomedes kills him: "Let not escape be in thy thoughts, since thou hast come into our hands."[^il10-death]

## In Euripides' [Rhesus](../sources/euripides-rhesus.md)

### Volunteering

In the *Rhesus*, Dolon's mission is dramatised more fully. When [Hector](hector.md) calls for a spy, Dolon volunteers and negotiates his reward. He refuses Priam's daughters, gold, and slaves — demanding instead [Achilles](achilles.md)' immortal horses, "for sprung from an immortal race themselves immortal they bear Pelides through the ranks of war, Neptune, 'tis said, the king of ocean, tamed them and gave to Peleus."[^eur-rh-dol-horses] Hector agrees, though they "interfered with" his own desire for the horses.

### Wolf-Skin Disguise

Dolon describes his disguise in vivid detail: "I to my back will fit the tawny hide of a slain wolf, will muffle up my front with the beast's hairy visage, fit my hands to his fore-feet, thrust into those behind my legs, and imitate his savage gait."[^eur-rh-dol-wolf] The Chorus prays that [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md), patron of well-conducted deceptions, will protect him.

He departs boasting: "I shall return in safety, and having slain Ulysses, or the son of Tydeus, bring to you their ghastly heads."[^eur-rh-dol-boast] He is killed offstage by Odysseus and Diomedes before the play's action continues. They learn the watchword "Apollo" from him.
