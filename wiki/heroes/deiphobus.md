## Overview

**Deiphobus** was a son of [Priam](priam.md) and [Hecuba](hecuba.md), and one of Troy's leading warriors after [Hector](hector.md)'s death. After [Paris](paris.md) was killed, Deiphobus married [Helen](helen.md). He was slain by [Menelaus](menelaus.md) during the sack of Troy, found "heavy with wine" in Helen's chamber.

## In the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md)

[Athena](../deities/athena.md) assumed Deiphobus's form to trick [Hector](hector.md) into standing and fighting [Achilles](achilles.md) in their final duel. When Hector turned to his supposed brother for a second spear, "Deiphobus was no more by his side." He realised "the gods have summoned me to death."[^il22]

## In the [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md)

After Paris's death, "Helenus and Deiphobus quarrelled as to which of them should marry [Helen](helen.md). As Deiphobus was preferred, Helenus left Troy."[^apd-quarrel] During the sack, "[Menelaus](menelaus.md) slew Deiphobus."[^apd-death]

## In the [Posthomerica](../sources/posthomerica.md)

### Rally Speech After Paris's Death (Book IX)

After [Paris](paris.md) died and [Philoctetes](philoctetes.md)' arrows turned the battle, some god — or his own spirit — "thrilled Deiphobus' heart, and made it void of fear." He rallied the Trojans with a rousing speech: "O friends, be stout of heart to play the men! Remember all the agonies that war brings in the end to them that yield to foes. Ye wrestle not for Alexander alone, nor Helen, but for home, for your own lives, for wives, for little ones, for parents grey."[^post-rally]

### Confrontation with Neoptolemus (Book IX)

[Neoptolemus](neoptolemus.md) charged against Deiphobus in [Achilles](achilles.md)' chariot. When they drew near, "Deiphobus, despite his battle-lust, stayed, as a ravening fire stays when it meets water. He marvelled, seeing Achilles' steeds and that gigantic son, huge as his sire." He was compared to a boar halted by the sudden appearance of a lion: "so halted Priam's son, car-steeds and car, perplexed, while quivered his hands about the lance." Neoptolemus taunted him: "If thine heart be brave indeed, of my spear now make trial in the strife."[^post-neo]

### Death in Helen's Chamber (Book XIII)

During the sack, [Menelaus](menelaus.md) "in Helen's bower found, heavy with wine, ill-starred Deiphobus, and slew him with the sword." Helen had fled and hidden herself. Menelaus exulted over the body: "Dog! I, even I have dealt thee unwelcome death this day! No dawn divine shall meet thee again alive in Troy — ay, though thou vaunt thyself spouse of the child of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) the thunder-voiced!" He invoked [Themis](../deities/themis.md): "wicked men never elude pure Themis: night and day her eyes are on them, and the wide world through above the tribes of men she floats in air, holpen of Zeus, for punishment of sin."[^post-death]

## In the [Aeneid](../sources/aeneid.md)

In [Virgil](../sources/aeneid.md), [Aeneas](aeneas.md) encounters Deiphobus's mutilated shade in the underworld (Book VI). He was betrayed by Helen on the night Troy fell — she removed his weapons while he slept and admitted Menelaus to the chamber.
