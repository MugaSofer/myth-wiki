## Overview

**Aegeus** was king of [Athens](../places/athens.md), son of [Pandion](pandion.md). Childless for much of his life, he consulted the oracle at Delphi and later fathered [Theseus](theseus.md) by Aethra at Troezen. He married [Medea](medea.md) after she fled Corinth, and died by throwing himself from the Athenian acropolis when he believed Theseus had perished on Crete.

## In Euripides' [Medea](../sources/euripides-medea.md)

Aegeus appears in person as a character in Euripides' *Medea*. He arrives in Corinth from "the ancient oracle of Phoebus" at Delphi, where he sought a cure for his childlessness.[^eur-med-oracle] The oracle gave him a cryptic response: "not to loose the projecting foot of the vessel" before returning home.[^eur-med-vessel] He is travelling to "Pittheus, king of the country of Trazene" — "the most pious son, as report says, of Pelops" — for help interpreting the oracle.[^eur-med-pittheus]

When Medea tells him of Jason's betrayal and her impending exile, Aegeus offers her asylum in Athens: "if thou comest to my country, I will endeavor to receive thee with hospitality, being a just man."[^eur-med-asylum] He insists she must make her own way there: "I shall not be willing to lead thee with me from this land... I wish to be without blame even among strangers."[^eur-med-condition]

Medea demands an oath, and Aegeus swears: "I swear by the earth, and the hallowed majesty of the sun, and by all the Gods, to abide by what I hear from thee."[^eur-med-swear] In return, Medea promises to cure his childlessness: "I will free thee from being childless, and I will cause thee to raise up offspring, such charms I know."[^eur-med-charms]

[^eur-med-oracle]: "Having left the ancient oracle of Phoebus... Inquiring of the God how offspring may arise to me" (Medea 665-669, trans. T.A. Buckley)
[^eur-med-vessel]: "That I was not to loose the projecting foot of the vessel... Before I revisit my paternal hearth" (Medea 679-681)
[^eur-med-pittheus]: "There is one Pittheus, king of the country of Trazene... The most pious son, as report says, of Pelops" (Medea 685-687)
[^eur-med-asylum]: "if thou comest to my country, I will endeavor to receive thee with hospitality, being a just man" (Medea 723-724)
[^eur-med-condition]: "I shall not be willing to lead thee with me from this land; but if thou comest thyself to my house, thou shalt stay there in safety, and to no one will I give thee up. But do thou of thyself withdraw thy foot from this country, for I wish to be without blame even among strangers" (Medea 725-730)
[^eur-med-swear]: "I swear by the earth, and the hallowed majesty of the sun, and by all the Gods, to abide by what I hear from thee" (Medea 752-753)
[^eur-med-charms]: "I will free thee from being childless, and I will cause thee to raise up offspring, such charms I know" (Medea 717-718)

## In the Bibliotheca

Aegeus and [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) both lay with Aethra at Troezen in the same night, producing [Theseus](theseus.md) with dual paternity. Before leaving, Aegeus "put his sandals and his sword under a certain rock" and charged Aethra to send the boy when he could lift the stone.[^apd-rock]

After Medea fled Corinth, she "came to Athens, and being there married to Aegeus bore him a son Medus."[^apd-medus] She later plotted against Theseus, persuading Aegeus to poison the unknown youth — but "just as the draught was about to be administered to him, he gave his father the sword, and on recognizing it Aegeus dashed the cup from his hands."[^apd-cup]

When Theseus returned from Crete but forgot to change his black sails to white, "Aegeus, seeing from the acropolis the ship with a black sail, supposed that Theseus had perished; so he cast himself down and died."[^apd-death]

[^apd-rock]: Aegeus "put his sandals and his sword under a certain rock" and charged Aethra to send the boy to Athens when he could lift it (Bibliotheca 3.15.7, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-medus]: "Medea came to Athens, and being there married to Aegeus bore him a son Medus" (Bibliotheca 1.9.28, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-cup]: "just as the draught was about to be administered to him, he gave his father the sword, and on recognizing it Aegeus dashed the cup from his hands" (Epitome 1.6, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-death]: "Aegeus, seeing from the acropolis the ship with a black sail, supposed that Theseus had perished; so he cast himself down and died" (Epitome 1.10, trans. Frazer)

## In the Fabulae

Hyginus gives the dual paternity account: "[Neptune](../deities/poseidon.md) and Aegeus, son of Pandion, one night in the shrine of [Minerva](../deities/athena.md) both lay with Aethra, daughter of Pittheus. Neptune conceded the child to Aegeus."[^hyg-dual] Aegeus "put his sword under a stone, and told Aethra that when the boy could lift the stone and take his father's sword, she should send him to him."[^hyg-token]

On Theseus's return from Crete, "Theseus left, he forgot to change the black sails, and so his father Aegeus judged that he had been devoured by the Minotaur. He threw himself into the sea, which was called Aegean from this."[^hyg-death]

[^hyg-dual]: "Neptune and Aegeus, son of Pandion, one night in the shrine of Minerva both lay with Aethra, daughter of Pittheus. Neptune conceded the child to Aegeus" (Fabulae §37, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-token]: "put his sword under a stone, and told Aethra that when the boy could lift the stone and take his father's sword, she should send him to him. He would recognize his son by that" (Fabulae §37, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-death]: "when Theseus left, he forgot to change the black sails, and so his father Aegeus judged that he had been devoured by the Minotaur. He threw himself into the sea, which was called Aegean from this" (Fabulae §43, trans. Mary Grant)

## In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md)

Ovid narrates how Medea "worked on Aegeus to present his own son, Theseus, with a deadly cup of aconite; prevailing by her art so that he deemed his son an enemy." Aegeus "recognized the sword he wore, for, graven on its ivory hilt was wrought a known device" and "struck the poison-cup from his devoted son's confiding lips."[^met-aegeus]

[^met-aegeus]: "Medea, seeking his destruction, brewed the juice of aconite... she worked on Aegeus to present his own son, Theseus, with a deadly cup of aconite; prevailing by her art so that he deemed his son an enemy... his father recognized the sword he wore, for, graven on its ivory hilt was wrought a known device — the token of his race. Astonished, Aegeus struck the poison-cup from his devoted son's confiding lips" (Metamorphoses 7.404-425, trans. Brookes More)
