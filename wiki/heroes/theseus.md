# Theseus

King of Athens, son of Aegeus (or **[Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md)**) and Aethra. Theseus is the great Athenian hero — slayer of bandits, the **Minotaur**, and the leader of Athens.

## In the Bibliotheca (3.15.7-3.16.2, E.1.1-E.1.24)

### Birth and the Tokens

Aegeus, childless and fearing his brothers, consulted the oracle at Delphi and received a cryptic reply. Journeying home through Troezen, he was hosted by Pittheus, who understood the oracle, made Aegeus drunk, and caused him to lie with his daughter Aethra — but in the same night Poseidon also had connexion with her. Aegeus left a sword and sandals under a rock, charging Aethra to send the boy when he could lift it.[^apd-theseus-birth]

### The Six Labours

When Theseus was grown, he pushed away the rock, took the sword and sandals, and set out on foot for Athens, clearing the road of evildoers:[^apd-theseus-rock]

1. At Epidaurus he slew **Periphetes** the Clubman, son of **[Hephaestus](../deities/hephaestus.md)**, and took his iron club.[^apd-theseus-periphetes]
2. At the Isthmus of Corinth he killed **Sinis** the Pine-bender.[^apd-theseus-sinis]
3. At Crommyon he slew the sow **Phaea**, offspring of **[Echidna](../creatures/echidna.md)** and **[Typhoeus](../creatures/typhoeus.md)**.[^apd-theseus-phaea]
4. He threw **Sciron** into the sea to be devoured by a huge turtle.[^apd-theseus-sciron]
5. At Eleusis he slew **Cercyon** by lifting him high and dashing him down.[^apd-theseus-cercyon]
6. He slew **Damastes** (Procrustes), who fitted travellers to his beds — hammering the short and sawing the tall.[^apd-theseus-procrustes]

### Arrival at Athens

**Medea**, then wedded to Aegeus, plotted against the unknown youth and persuaded Aegeus to send him against the Marathonian bull. Theseus killed it. Then Aegeus presented him poison from Medea — but just as the draught was about to be given, Theseus showed his father the sword. Aegeus recognized it, dashed the cup away, and expelled Medea.[^apd-theseus-medea]

### The Minotaur

Theseus was numbered among those sent as tribute to the Minotaur — or, as some say, offered himself voluntarily. Aegeus charged him to spread white sails if he returned alive.[^apd-theseus-tribute]

In Crete, **[Ariadne](../heroes/ariadne.md)**, daughter of **[Minos](../heroes/minos.md)**, fell in love with him and offered help if he would carry her to Athens as his wife. On the advice of Daedalus, she gave him a clue of thread. Theseus fastened it to the door, entered the Labyrinth, found the Minotaur in its depths, and "killed him by smiting him with his fists." Drawing the thread after him, he made his way out.[^apd-theseus-minotaur]

By night they sailed to Naxos, where **[Dionysus](../deities/dionysus.md)** fell in love with Ariadne and carried her off.[^apd-theseus-naxos] In his grief, Theseus forgot to spread white sails. Aegeus, seeing the black sail, threw himself from the acropolis and died.[^apd-theseus-aegeus]

### Ariadne and Aegle (Catalogue of Women)

The Catalogue preserves a variant tradition about why Theseus abandoned [Ariadne](../heroes/ariadne.md): "strong love for Aegle the daughter of Panopeus overpowered him."[^cat-aegle] Hereas of Megara claimed that Peisistratus removed this verse from the works of Hesiod. Another fragment adds that "Theseus wedded both Hippe and Aegle lawfully."[^cat-hippe]

[^cat-aegle]: "For strong love for Aegle the daughter of Panopeus overpowered him" (Catalogue of Women, Fragment 76, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^cat-hippe]: "Theseus wedded both Hippe and Aegle lawfully" (Catalogue of Women, Fragment 76, from Athenaeus, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

### Later Adventures

Theseus joined **[Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md)** against the Amazons and carried off Antiope (or Hippolyte). By the Amazon he had a son Hippolytus.[^apd-theseus-amazon] He later married Phaedra, daughter of Minos. Phaedra fell in love with Hippolytus, who rejected her; she falsely accused him to Theseus, who prayed to Poseidon. A bull rose from the surf and frightened Hippolytus's horses, dragging him to death. When the truth emerged, Phaedra hanged herself.[^apd-theseus-phaedra]

### The Underworld and Death

Theseus and Pirithous, having sworn to marry daughters of **[Zeus](../deities/zeus.md)**, first carried off **[Helen](../heroes/helen.md)** from Sparta for Theseus (when she was twelve years old), then descended to **[Hades](../deities/hades.md)** to win **[Persephone](../deities/persephone.md)** for Pirithous. There Hades tricked them into sitting on the Chair of Forgetfulness, where they were held fast by serpent coils. Pirithous remained bound forever, but Heracles brought Theseus up.[^apd-theseus-hades]

Meanwhile the Dioscuri captured Athens, recovered Helen, and gave the sovereignty to Menestheus. Theseus, driven out, went to Lycomedes on Scyros, who threw him from a cliff and killed him.[^apd-theseus-death]
