# Theseus

King of Athens, son of Aegeus (or **[Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md)**) and Aethra. Theseus is the great Athenian hero — slayer of bandits, the **Minotaur**, and the leader of Athens.

## In the [Argonautica](../sources/argonautica.md)

Theseus was absent from the Argonaut voyage. The Argonautica explains his absence: "he was held in bonds beneath the earth at Taenarus with Peirithous."[^arg-theseus-absent] Jason cited Theseus's story as a precedent when appealing to Medea — invoking how [Ariadne](ariadne.md) had helped Theseus escape the Labyrinth as an example of a woman aiding a hero at great personal cost.

[^arg-theseus-absent]: "he was held in bonds beneath the earth at Taenarus with Peirithous" (Argonautica 1.101-104, trans. R.C. Seaton)

## In the Bibliotheca (3.15.7-3.16.2, E.1.1-E.1.24)

### Birth and the Tokens

Aegeus, childless and fearing his brothers, consulted the oracle at Delphi and received a cryptic reply. Journeying home through Troezen, he was hosted by Pittheus, who understood the oracle, made Aegeus drunk, and caused him to lie with his daughter Aethra — but in the same night Poseidon also had connexion with her. Aegeus left a sword and sandals under a rock, charging Aethra to send the boy when he could lift it.[^apd-theseus-birth]

### The Six Labours

When Theseus was grown, he pushed away the rock, took the sword and sandals, and set out on foot for Athens, clearing the road of evildoers:[^apd-theseus-rock]

1. At Epidaurus he slew **Periphetes** the Clubman, son of **[Hephaestus](../deities/hephaestus.md)**, and took his iron club.[^apd-theseus-periphetes]
2. At the Isthmus of Corinth he killed **Sinis** the Pine-bender.[^apd-theseus-sinis]
3. At Crommyon he slew the sow **Phaea**, offspring of **[Echidna](../creatures/echidna.md)** and **[Typhoeus](../creatures/typhoeus.md)**.[^apd-theseus-phaea]
4. He threw **Sciron** into the sea to be devoured by a huge turtle.[^apd-theseus-sciron]
5. At Eleusis he slew **Cercyon** by lifting him high and dashing him down.[^apd-theseus-cercyon]
6. He slew **Damastes** (Procrustes), who fitted travellers to his beds — hammering the short and sawing the tall.[^apd-theseus-procrustes]

### Arrival at Athens

**Medea**, then wedded to Aegeus, plotted against the unknown youth and persuaded Aegeus to send him against the Marathonian bull. Theseus killed it. Then Aegeus presented him poison from Medea — but just as the draught was about to be given, Theseus showed his father the sword. Aegeus recognized it, dashed the cup away, and expelled Medea.[^apd-theseus-medea]

### The Minotaur

Theseus was numbered among those sent as tribute to the Minotaur — or, as some say, offered himself voluntarily. Aegeus charged him to spread white sails if he returned alive.[^apd-theseus-tribute]

In Crete, **[Ariadne](../heroes/ariadne.md)**, daughter of **[Minos](../heroes/minos.md)**, fell in love with him and offered help if he would carry her to Athens as his wife. On the advice of Daedalus, she gave him a clue of thread. Theseus fastened it to the door, entered the Labyrinth, found the Minotaur in its depths, and "killed him by smiting him with his fists." Drawing the thread after him, he made his way out.[^apd-theseus-minotaur]

By night they sailed to Naxos, where **[Dionysus](../deities/dionysus.md)** fell in love with Ariadne and carried her off.[^apd-theseus-naxos] In his grief, Theseus forgot to spread white sails. Aegeus, seeing the black sail, threw himself from the acropolis and died.[^apd-theseus-aegeus]

### Ariadne and Aegle (Catalogue of Women)

The Catalogue preserves a variant tradition about why Theseus abandoned [Ariadne](../heroes/ariadne.md): "strong love for Aegle the daughter of Panopeus overpowered him."[^cat-aegle] Hereas of Megara claimed that Peisistratus removed this verse from the works of Hesiod. Another fragment adds that "Theseus wedded both Hippe and Aegle lawfully."[^cat-hippe]

[^cat-aegle]: "For strong love for Aegle the daughter of Panopeus overpowered him" (Catalogue of Women, Fragment 76, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^cat-hippe]: "Theseus wedded both Hippe and Aegle lawfully" (Catalogue of Women, Fragment 76, from Athenaeus, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

### Later Adventures

Theseus joined **[Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md)** against the Amazons and carried off Antiope (or Hippolyte). By the Amazon he had a son Hippolytus.[^apd-theseus-amazon] He later married Phaedra, daughter of Minos. Phaedra fell in love with Hippolytus, who rejected her; she falsely accused him to Theseus, who prayed to Poseidon. A bull rose from the surf and frightened Hippolytus's horses, dragging him to death. When the truth emerged, Phaedra hanged herself.[^apd-theseus-phaedra]

### The Underworld and Death

Theseus and Pirithous, having sworn to marry daughters of **[Zeus](../deities/zeus.md)**, first carried off **[Helen](../heroes/helen.md)** from Sparta for Theseus (when she was twelve years old), then descended to **[Hades](../deities/hades.md)** to win **[Persephone](../deities/persephone.md)** for Pirithous. There Hades tricked them into sitting on the Chair of Forgetfulness, where they were held fast by serpent coils. Pirithous remained bound forever, but Heracles brought Theseus up.[^apd-theseus-hades]

Meanwhile the Dioscuri captured Athens, recovered Helen, and gave the sovereignty to Menestheus. Theseus, driven out, went to Lycomedes on Scyros, who threw him from a cliff and killed him.[^apd-theseus-death]

## In the Fabulae

### The Tokens Under the Stone (§37)

The [Fabulae](../sources/hyginus.md) provides a clean account of Theseus's dual paternity. "Neptune and Aegeus, son of Pandion, one night in the shrine of Minerva both lay with Aethra, daughter of Pittheus. Neptune conceded the child to Aegeus."[^hyg-37-dual] Before returning to Athens, Aegeus "put his sword under a stone, and told Aethra that when the boy could lift the stone and take his father's sword, she should send him to him. He would recognize his son by that."[^hyg-37-token]

"When he had reached young manhood, his mother told him Aegeus' instructions, showed him the stone so that he could get the sword, and bade him set out for Athens to Aegeus... and he killed all those who made the road unsafe."[^hyg-37-labors]

> **NEW DETAIL:** [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) "conceded the child to Aegeus" — a striking acknowledgment of divine precedence yielding to mortal paternity.

[^hyg-37-dual]: "Neptune and Aegeus, son of Pandion, one night in the shrine of Minerva both lay with Aethra, daughter of Pittheus. Neptune conceded the child to Aegeus" (Fabulae §37, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-37-token]: "put his sword under a stone, and told Aethra that when the boy could lift the stone and take his father's sword, she should send him to him. He would recognize his son by that" (Fabulae §37, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-37-labors]: "When he had reached young manhood, his mother told him Aegeus' instructions, showed him the stone so that he could get the sword, and bade him set out for Athens to Aegeus... and he killed all those who made the road unsafe" (Fabulae §37, trans. Mary Grant)

### The Six Labours (§38)

Hyginus catalogues Theseus's road-clearing exploits with vivid detail:

1. **Corynetes**: "He slew Corynetes, son of Neptune, by force of arms."[^hyg-38-corynetes]
2. **Pityocamptes** (the Pine-bender): "He killed Pityocamptes, who forced travellers to help him bend a pine tree to the ground. When they had taken hold of it with him, he let it rebound suddenly with force. Thus they were dashed violently to the ground and died."[^hyg-38-pityocamptes]
3. **Procrustes**: "He killed Procrustes, son of Neptune. When a guest came to visit him, if he was rather tall, he brought a shorter bed, and cut off the rest of his body; if rather short, he gave him a longer bed, and by hanging anvils to him stretched him to match the length of the bed."[^hyg-38-procrustes]
4. **Sciron**: "Sciron used to sit near the sea at a certain point, and compel those who passed by to wash his feet; then he kicked them into the sea. Theseus cast him into the sea by a similar death, and from this the rocks are called those of Sciron."[^hyg-38-sciron]
5. **Cercyon**: "He killed by force of arms Cercyon, son of Vulcan."[^hyg-38-cercyon]
6. **The Crommyonian Boar**: "He killed the boar which was at Cremyon."[^hyg-38-boar]

Additionally: "He killed the bull at Marathon, which Hercules had brought to Eurystheus from Crete. He killed the Minotaur in the town of Cnossus."[^hyg-38-minotaur]

[^hyg-38-corynetes]: "He slew Corynetes, son of Neptune, by force of arms" (Fabulae §38, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-38-pityocamptes]: "He killed Pityocamptes, who forced travellers to help him bend a pine tree to the ground. When they had taken hold of it with him, he let it rebound suddenly with force. Thus they were dashed violently to the ground and died" (Fabulae §38, trans. Mary Grant)

Mary Grant)

### Ariadne and the Labyrinth (§42)

The Minotaur episode is told briefly. "When Theseus came to Crete, Ariadne, Minos' daughter, loved him so much that she betrayed her brother and saved the stranger, or she showed Theseus the way out of the Labyrinth."[^hyg-42-ariadne] Theseus "entered and killed the Minotaur, by Ariadne's advise he got out by unwinding the thread. Ariadne, because she had been loyal to him, he took away, intending to marry her."[^hyg-42-thread]

[^hyg-42-ariadne]: "When Theseus came to Crete, Ariadne, Minos' daughter, loved him so much that she betrayed her brother and saved the stranger, or she showed Theseus the way out of the Labyrinth" (Fabulae §42, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-42-thread]: "When Theseus had entered and killed the Minotaur, by Ariadne's advise he got out by unwinding the thread. Ariadne, because she had been loyal to him, he took away, intending to marry her" (Fabulae §42, trans. Mary Grant)

### Abandonment on Dia (§43)

The abandonment is presented as deliberate shame-avoidance. "Theseus, detained by a storm on the island of Dia, though it would be a reproach to him if he brought Ariadne to Athens, and so he left her asleep on the island of Dia."[^hyg-43-abandon] [Dionysus](../deities/dionysus.md) "falling in love with her, took her from there as his wife."[^hyg-43-dionysus]

The black sails follow: "when Theseus left, he forgot to change the black sails, and so his father Aegeus judged that he had been devoured by the Minotaur. He threw himself into the sea, which was called Aegean from this."[^hyg-43-aegeus]

> **VARIANT:** Hyginus says Theseus deliberately abandoned Ariadne to avoid reproach, not that he was ordered by [Dionysus](../deities/dionysus.md) or [Athena](../deities/athena.md).

[^hyg-43-abandon]: "Theseus, detained by a storm on the island of Dia, though it would be a reproach to him if he brought Ariadne to Athens, and so he left her asleep on the island of Dia" (Fabulae §43, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-43-dionysus]: "Liber, falling in love with her, took her from there as his wife" (Fabulae §43, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-43-aegeus]: "when Theseus left, he forgot to change the black sails, and so his father Aegeus judged that he had been devoured by the Minotaur. He threw himself into the sea, which was called Aegean from this. But Theseus married Phaedra, Ariadne's sister" (Fabulae §43, trans. Mary Grant)

## In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md)

### Medea's Attempted Poisoning (7.404-424)

Theseus arrived at Athens unknown to his father Aegeus. [Medea](medea.md), who had married Aegeus, "seeking his destruction, brewed the juice of aconite" — a poison grown from the frothing of [Cerberus](../creatures/cerberus.md) when [Heracles](heracles.md) dragged him from the underworld. She "worked on Aegeus to present his own son, Theseus, with a deadly cup of aconite; prevailing by her art so that he deemed his son an enemy."[^met-thes-poison]

"Theseus unwittingly received the cup, but just before he touched it to his lips, his father recognized the sword he wore, for, graven on its ivory hilt was wrought a known device — the token of his race. Astonished, Aegeus struck the poison-cup from his devoted son's confiding lips." Medea escaped "in a dark whirlwind her witch-singing raised."[^met-thes-rescue]

### The Song of His Deeds (7.425-452)

The Athenians celebrated Theseus with a song cataloguing his labours: "Did you not slaughter the huge bull of Crete?... And Periphetes, wielder of the club, was worsted when he struggled with your strength; And fierce Procrustes... met his death; And even Cercyon, in Eleusis lost his wicked life... And Sinis, a monstrosity of strength, who bent the trunks of trees... Even the road to Megara is safe, For you did hurl the robber Scyron, — sheer — over the cliff."[^met-thes-song]

[^met-thes-poison]: "Medea, seeking his destruction, brewed the juice of aconite... she worked on Aegeus to present his own son, Theseus, with a deadly cup of aconite; prevailing by her art so that he deemed his son an enemy" (Metamorphoses 7.404-419, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-thes-rescue]: "Theseus unwittingly received the cup, but just before he touched it to his lips, his father recognized the sword he wore, for, graven on its ivory hilt was wrought a known device — the token of his race. Astonished, Aegeus struck the poison-cup from his devoted son's confiding lips" (Metamorphoses 7.419-425, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-thes-song]: "Did you not slaughter the huge bull of Crete?... And Periphetes, wielder of the club, was worsted when he struggled with your strength; And fierce Procrustes, matched with you beside the rapid river, met his death" (Metamorphoses 7.433-443, trans. Brookes More)
