## Overview

**Eurydice** was the wife of [Creon](../heroes/creon.md) and mother of [Haemon](../heroes/haemon.md) and Megareus. She appears only in Sophocles' Antigone, where she emerges from the palace just as the messenger begins to describe Haemon's death, listens in silence, and withdraws without a word. She is shortly reported to have stabbed herself at the altar, cursing Creon as the killer of her children.

## In Sophocles' Antigone

Eurydice enters because she overheard the chorus speaking as she was drawing back the door to go offer prayers to [Pallas Athena](../deities/athena.md). She describes collapsing at the news: "Stricken with terror in my handmaids' arms / I fell and fainted."[^sa-faint] She asks for the full account.

The messenger tells her of Haemon's death. She exits without speaking. The chorus is uneasy: "I know not, but strained silence, so I deem, / Is no less ominous than excessive grief."[^sa-silence]

A second messenger reports what followed: "Beside the altar on a keen-edged sword / She fell and closed her eyes in night, but erst / She mourned for Megareus who nobly died / Long since, then for her son; with her last breath / She cursed thee, the slayer of her child."[^sa-death]

When Creon asks how she destroyed herself, the messenger replies: "Hearing the loud lament above her son / With her own hand she stabbed herself to the heart."[^sa-stabbed]

Creon accepts the guilt: "I am the guilty cause. I did the deed, / Thy murderer."[^sa-creon]
