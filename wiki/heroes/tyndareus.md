## Overview

**Tyndareus** was king of Sparta and the mortal husband of [Leda](leda.md). Through his wife's union with [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) in the form of a swan, he became the foster-father of [Helen](helen.md) and [Pollux](dioscuri.md), and the father of [Castor](dioscuri.md) and [Clytemnestra](clytemnestra.md). He is best known for devising (at [Odysseus](odysseus.md)'s suggestion) the oath that bound Helen's suitors to defend her chosen husband — the oath that would later compel the Greeks to wage the [Trojan War](../events/trojan-war.md).

## In the Bibliotheca

### Exile and Restoration (3.10.4-5)

Apollodorus gives two genealogies: Tyndareus was either the son of Perieres (son of Aeolus) or, alternatively, "Oebalus begat Tyndareus, Hippocoon, and Icarius by a Naiad nymph Batia."[^apd-parents]

Hippocoon and his sons expelled Tyndareus and his brother Icarius from Lacedaemon. "They fled to Thestius and allied themselves with him in the war which he waged with his neighbors; and Tyndareus married Leda, daughter of Thestius."[^apd-exile] After [Heracles](heracles.md) killed Hippocoon and his sons, "they returned, and Tyndareus succeeded to the kingdom."[^apd-return]

[^apd-parents]: "Oebalus begat Tyndareus, Hippocoon, and Icarius by a Naiad nymph Batia" (Bibliotheca 3.10.4, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-exile]: "They fled to Thestius and allied themselves with him in the war which he waged with his neighbors; and Tyndareus married Leda, daughter of Thestius" (Bibliotheca 3.10.5, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-return]: Bibliotheca 3.10.5; cf. 2.7.3

### Children (3.10.6-7)

"Tyndareus and Leda had daughters, to wit, Timandra, whom Echemus married, and Clytaemnestra, whom [Agamemnon](agamemnon.md) married; also another daughter Phylonoe, whom [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md) made immortal."[^apd-daughters]

The divine parentage of the twins and Helen is given: "Zeus in the form of a swan consorted with Leda, and on the same night Tyndareus cohabited with her; and she bore Pollux and Helen to Zeus, and Castor and Clytaemnestra to Tyndareus."[^apd-swan]

[^apd-daughters]: "Tyndareus and Leda had daughters, to wit, Timandra, whom Echemus married, and Clytaemnestra, whom Agamemnon married; also another daughter Phylonoe, whom Artemis made immortal" (Bibliotheca 3.10.6, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-swan]: "Zeus in the form of a swan consorted with Leda, and on the same night Tyndareus cohabited with her; and she bore Pollux and Helen to Zeus, and Castor and Clytaemnestra to Tyndareus" (Bibliotheca 3.10.7, trans. J.G. Frazer)

### The Oath of Tyndareus (3.10.9)

When the multitude of Helen's suitors gathered, "Tyndareus feared that the preference of one might set the others quarrelling." [Odysseus](odysseus.md) proposed a solution in exchange for help winning [Penelope](penelope.md)'s hand: "Ulysses told him to exact an oath from all the suitors that they would defend the favoured bridegroom against any wrong that might be done him in respect of his marriage."[^apd-oath]

"On hearing that, Tyndareus put the suitors on their oath, and while he chose Menelaus to be the bridegroom of Helen, he solicited Icarius to bestow Penelope on Ulysses."[^apd-chose]

This oath would later bind all the former suitors to join the expedition against [Troy](../places/troy.md) when [Paris](paris.md) abducted Helen.

[^apd-oath]: "Ulysses told him to exact an oath from all the suitors that they would defend the favoured bridegroom against any wrong that might be done him in respect of his marriage" (Bibliotheca 3.10.9, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-chose]: "On hearing that, Tyndareus put the suitors on their oath, and while he chose Menelaus to be the bridegroom of Helen, he solicited Icarius to bestow Penelope on Ulysses" (Bibliotheca 3.10.9, trans. J.G. Frazer)

### Ceding the Kingdom (3.11.2)

After the [Dioscuri](dioscuri.md) "were translated to the gods, Tyndareus sent for Menelaus to Sparta and handed over the kingdom to him."[^apd-cede]

[^apd-cede]: "when the Dioscuri were translated to the gods, Tyndareus sent for Menelaus to Sparta and handed over the kingdom to him" (Bibliotheca 3.11.2, trans. J.G. Frazer)

### Restoring Agamemnon (E.2.15-16)

Tyndareus also played a role in the House of Atreus: after Atreus was killed, "Tyndareus brought them back again" (referring to [Agamemnon](agamemnon.md) and [Menelaus](menelaus.md)), "and they drove away Thyestes." The brothers then consolidated power "by marrying his daughters, Agamemnon getting Clytaemnestra to wife."[^apd-atreid]

[^apd-atreid]: "Tyndareus brought them back again, and they drove away Thyestes to dwell in Cytheria, after that they had been already reconciled to Tyndareus by marrying his daughters" (Bibliotheca E.2.15-16, trans. J.G. Frazer)

## In Euripides' Orestes

Tyndareus appears as a speaking character, demanding [Orestes](orestes.md)' execution for the murder of [Clytemnestra](clytemnestra.md) — his own daughter. He argues that Orestes should have prosecuted his mother legally rather than killing her. His influence at the Argive assembly contributes to Orestes' death sentence.[^eur-or-tyn]
