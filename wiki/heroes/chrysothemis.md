## Overview

**Chrysothemis** was a daughter of [Agamemnon](agamemnon.md) and [Clytemnestra](clytemnestra.md), and sister of [Electra](electra.md), [Orestes](orestes.md), and [Iphigenia](iphigenia.md). She appears in Sophocles' tragedy as a foil to Electra, sympathising with her sister's suffering but refusing to resist their mother's authority: "in misfortune I have chosen to sail with lowered canvas."[^soph-el-canvas]

## In Sophocles' Electra

In [Sophocles](../sources/sophocles-electra.md)' tragedy, Chrysothemis enters carrying libations that [Clytemnestra](clytemnestra.md) has sent to [Agamemnon](agamemnon.md)'s tomb, prompted by a terrifying prophetic dream. She reports the dream to [Electra](electra.md): Agamemnon's spirit had returned and planted his sceptre on the hearth, and from it a shoot grew that "shadowed all the ground of loved Mycenae."[^soph-el-dream] She also warns Electra that [Aegisthus](aegisthus.md) plans to entomb her in a rock-hewn chamber if she continues mourning.

Electra persuades Chrysothemis to set aside Clytemnestra's offerings and replace them at the tomb with their own — locks of hair and Electra's girdle — and to pray for Orestes' return.

Later, Chrysothemis visits Agamemnon's tomb and finds offerings there — including a lock of hair — which she takes as evidence that Orestes has secretly returned. She rushes back to tell Electra, but Electra has by then received the false news of Orestes' death and dismisses the hope.

When Electra, believing Orestes dead, urges Chrysothemis to join her in killing Aegisthus alone, Chrysothemis refuses. She argues that without strength or allies, the plan is hopeless.
