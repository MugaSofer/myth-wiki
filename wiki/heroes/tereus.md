## Overview

**Tereus** was a king of Thrace who married Procne, daughter of Pandion king of Athens. His rape of Philomela and the savage revenge that followed constitute one of the most harrowing stories in Ovid's [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md).

## In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md)

### Marriage to Procne (6.412-434)

Tereus came to the aid of Athens against invaders and "by his great deeds achieved a glorious fame." Pandion gave him his daughter Procne, but the wedding was attended by dark omens: "Juno, guardian of the sacred rites attended not, nor Hymenaeus, nor the Graces. But the Furies snatched up brands from burning funeral pyres, and brandished them as torches." A boding owl sat on the roof of the bridal chamber.[^met-ter-wedding]

They had a son, Itys.

### The Rape of Philomela (6.438-570)

After five years, Procne asked Tereus to fetch her sister Philomela for a visit. When Tereus saw Philomela, "he was consumed with love. Her modest beauty was a worthy cause of worthy love; but by his heritage, derived from a debasing clime, his love was base."[^met-ter-lust] He pleaded eloquently before Pandion, pretending to speak Procne's wishes while feeding his own desire.

Pandion reluctantly entrusted Philomela to Tereus, weeping at the parting. Once at sea, Tereus exulted: "Now all is well, the object of my love sails with me." On landing in Thrace, he dragged her to a house hidden deep in the forest, where "he overmastered her with brutal force." Philomela "trembled as a frightened lamb, which, just delivered from the frothing jaws of a gaunt wolf, dreads every moving twig."[^met-ter-rape]

Philomela denounced him: "Oh, if there is a Majesty in Heaven, and if my ruin has not wrecked the world, then, you shall suffer for this grievous wrong... I shall declare your sin before the world."[^met-ter-speech] Tereus, frightened by her threats, seized her tongue with pincers and "cut it with his sword.—The mangled root still quivered, but the bleeding tongue itself, fell murmuring on the blood-stained floor. As the tail of a slain snake still writhes upon the ground, so did the throbbing tongue."[^met-ter-tongue]

### The Woven Message (6.571-586)

Tereus told Procne that Philomela had died, and Procne built a sepulchre and mourned. A year passed. Imprisoned and tongueless, "the grief-distracted Philomela wove in a warp with purple marks and white, a story of the crime" and sent it secretly to Procne.[^met-ter-weaving]

### The Feast of Itys (6.587-666)

Procne, reading the cloth, was consumed with rage. During the festival of Bacchus, she disguised herself as a Bacchant and rescued Philomela from the prison-house. Back at the palace, when Itys came to his mother, Procne saw her husband's likeness in the child. She hesitated: "Why does the little one prevail with pretty words, while Philomela stands in silence always, with her tongue torn out?"[^met-ter-hesitate]

She killed Itys with a sword while he cried "Ah, mother,—ah!" and clung to her. Philomela cut his throat. They "mangled his remains, still quivering with the remnant of his life, and boiled a part of him in steaming pots... and roasted other parts on hissing spits."[^met-ter-murder]

Procne served the flesh to Tereus, who "majestic on his ancient throne high in imagined state, devoured his son, and gorged himself with flesh of his own flesh." When he called for Itys, Procne cried: "Inside yourself, you have the thing that you are asking for!" Philomela sprang forth and "hurled the head of Itys in his father's fear-struck face."[^met-ter-feast]

### Transformation (6.667-674)

Tereus drew his sword and chased the sisters. "Fleeing from him, they seemed to rise on wings, and it was true, for they had changed to birds." Philomela became a bird in the woods, Procne became the swallow — "always, if you look, you can observe the brand of murder on the swallow's breast — red feathers from that day." Tereus was changed into the hoopoe, "his long, sharp beak is given him instead of a long sword."[^met-ter-birds]

[^met-ter-wedding]: "Juno, guardian of the sacred rites attended not, nor Hymenaeus, nor the Graces. But the Furies snatched up brands from burning funeral pyres, and brandished them as torches. They prepared the nuptial couch,—a boding owl flew over the bride's room, and then sat silently upon the roof" (Metamorphoses 6.428-434, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-ter-lust]: "he was consumed with love. Her modest beauty was a worthy cause of worthy love; but by his heritage, derived from a debasing clime, his love was base; and fires unholy burned within from his own lawless nature, just as fierce as are the habits of his evil race" (Metamorphoses 6.455-462, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-ter-rape]: "The poor child trembled as a frightened lamb, which, just delivered from the frothing jaws of a gaunt wolf, dreads every moving twig" (Metamorphoses 6.527-529, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-ter-speech]: "Oh, if there is a Majesty in Heaven, and if my ruin has not wrecked the world, then, you shall suffer for this grievous wrong and time shall hasten to avenge my wreck. I shall declare your sin before the world, and publish my own shame to punish you!" (Metamorphoses 6.542-547, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-ter-tongue]: "he caught her tongue with pincers, pitiless, and cut it with his sword.—The mangled root still quivered, but the bleeding tongue itself, fell murmuring on the blood-stained floor. As the tail of a slain snake still writhes upon the ground, so did the throbbing tongue" (Metamorphoses 6.556-562, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-ter-weaving]: "the grief-distracted Philomela wove in a warp with purple marks and white, a story of the crime; and when 'twas done she gave it to her one attendant there and begged her by appropriate signs to take it secretly to Procne" (Metamorphoses 6.576-582, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-ter-hesitate]: "Why does the little one prevail with pretty words, while Philomela stands in silence always, with her tongue torn out? She cannot call her sister, whom he calls his mother!" (Metamorphoses 6.631-635, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-ter-murder]: "mangled his remains, still quivering with the remnant of his life, and boiled a part of him in steaming pots, that bubbled over with the dead child's blood, and roasted other parts on hissing spits" (Metamorphoses 6.651-655, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-ter-feast]: "majestic on his ancient throne high in imagined state, devoured his son, and gorged himself with flesh of his own flesh—and in his rage of gluttony called out for Itys to attend and share the feast!" (Metamorphoses 6.661-665, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-ter-birds]: "Fleeing from him, they seemed to rise on wings, and it was true, for they had changed to birds. Then Philomela, flitting to the woods, found refuge in the leaves: but Procne flew straight to the sheltering gables of a roof... And Tereus, swift in his great agitation... is turned into a crested bird. His long, sharp beak is given him instead of a long sword" (Metamorphoses 6.667-674, trans. Brookes More)
