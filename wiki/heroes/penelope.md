## Overview

**Penelope** is the wife of [Odysseus](odysseus.md) and queen of Ithaca, famous for her faithfulness and cunning during the twenty years of his absence. She held off 136 suitors by the stratagem of weaving and unweaving the shroud of Laertes. The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) preserves several variant traditions about her, including darker ones.

## In the Bibliotheca

### Marriage (3.10.6, 3.10.9)

"Icarius and Periboea, a Naiad nymph, had five sons... and a daughter Penelope, whom Ulysses married."[^apd-parentage]

[Odysseus](odysseus.md) gained Penelope's hand through a bargain — he devised the suitors' oath in exchange for Tyndareus helping him win her.[^apd-bargain]

### The Shroud (E.7.31)

"Penelope was compelled to promise that she would wed when the shroud of Laertes was finished, and she wove it for three years, weaving it by day and undoing it by night. In this way the suitors were deceived by Penelope, till she was detected."[^apd-shroud]

### The Bow and Slaying of the Suitors (E.7.33)

"Penelope delivered to the suitors the bow of Ulysses, which he had once received from Iphitus; and she said that she would marry him who bent the bow. When none of them could bend it, Ulysses took it and shot down the suitors."[^apd-bow]

### Variant Traditions (E.7.37-39)

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) records strikingly different traditions about Penelope's fate:

**1. Circe's island:** After Odysseus's death by Telegonus, "Telegonus recognized him, he bitterly lamented, and conveyed the corpse and Penelope to [Circe](circe.md), and there he married Penelope. And Circe sent them both away to the Islands of the Blest."[^apd-circe]

**2. Pan's mother:** "Some say that Penelope was seduced by Antinous and sent away by Ulysses to her father Icarius, and that when she came to Mantinea in Arcadia she bore [Pan](../deities/pan.md) to [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md)."[^apd-pan]

**3. Killed by Odysseus:** "Others say that she met her end at the hands of Ulysses himself on account of Amphinomus, for they allege that she was seduced by him."[^apd-killed]

## In the Odyssey

In the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md), Penelope is the primary figure of the Ithaca narrative. Key moments include:
- [Athena](../deities/athena.md) creates a phantom to comfort her in sleep (Book IV)
- [Athena](../deities/athena.md) beautifies her — "even as when Artemis or golden [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md)" — to appear before the suitors (Book XVIII)
- She prays to [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md) for death (Books XVIII, XX)
- She tells the dream of the gates of horn and ivory (Book XIX)
- She sets the contest of the bow (Book XXI)
- She tests Odysseus with the secret of the bed (Book XXIII)
