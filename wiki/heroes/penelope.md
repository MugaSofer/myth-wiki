## Overview

**Penelope** is the wife of [Odysseus](odysseus.md) and queen of Ithaca, famous for her faithfulness and cunning during the twenty years of his absence. She held off 136 suitors by the stratagem of weaving and unweaving the shroud of Laertes. The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) preserves several variant traditions about her, including darker ones.

## Appearance

[Athena](../deities/athena.md) beautifies Penelope before she appears to the suitors, giving her "gifts immortal, that all the Achaeans might marvel at her. Her fair face first she steeped with beauty imperishable, such as that wherewith the crowned Cytherea [[Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md)] is anointed, when she goes to the lovely dances of the [Graces](../deities/graces.md). And she made her taller and greater to behold, and made her whiter than new-sawn ivory."[^od18-beauty]

When she greets [Telemachus](telemachus.md) on his return from Sparta, she is compared to two goddesses: "wise Penelope came forth from her chamber, like [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md) or golden [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md), and cast her arms about her dear son."[^od17-artemis]

[^od18-beauty]: "Her fair face first she steeped with beauty imperishable, such as that wherewith the crowned Cytherea is anointed, when she goes to the lovely dances of the Graces. And she made her taller and greater to behold, and made her whiter than new-sawn ivory" (Odyssey 18.193-198, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od17-artemis]: "wise Penelope came forth from her chamber, like Artemis or golden Aphrodite, and cast her arms about her dear son" (Odyssey 17.38)

## In the Bibliotheca

### Marriage (3.10.6, 3.10.9)

"Icarius and Periboea, a Naiad nymph, had five sons... and a daughter Penelope, whom Ulysses married."[^apd-parentage]

[Odysseus](odysseus.md) gained Penelope's hand through a bargain — he devised the suitors' oath in exchange for Tyndareus helping him win her.[^apd-bargain]

### The Shroud (E.7.31)

"Penelope was compelled to promise that she would wed when the shroud of Laertes was finished, and she wove it for three years, weaving it by day and undoing it by night. In this way the suitors were deceived by Penelope, till she was detected."[^apd-shroud]

### The Bow and Slaying of the Suitors (E.7.33)

"Penelope delivered to the suitors the bow of Ulysses, which he had once received from Iphitus; and she said that she would marry him who bent the bow. When none of them could bend it, Ulysses took it and shot down the suitors."[^apd-bow]

### Variant Traditions (E.7.37-39)

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) records strikingly different traditions about Penelope's fate:

**1. Circe's island:** After Odysseus's death by Telegonus, "Telegonus recognized him, he bitterly lamented, and conveyed the corpse and Penelope to [Circe](../deities/circe.md), and there he married Penelope. And Circe sent them both away to the Islands of the Blest."[^apd-circe]

**2. Pan's mother:** "Some say that Penelope was seduced by Antinous and sent away by Ulysses to her father Icarius, and that when she came to Mantinea in Arcadia she bore [Pan](../deities/pan.md) to [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md)."[^apd-pan]

**3. Killed by Odysseus:** "Others say that she met her end at the hands of Ulysses himself on account of Amphinomus, for they allege that she was seduced by him."[^apd-killed]

## In the Odyssey

### Antinous's Tribute to Her Cunning (Book II)

Even her chief tormentor, Antinous, acknowledges Penelope's extraordinary intelligence. He tells [Telemachus](telemachus.md) that she surpasses all women in history: "pondering in her heart those things that [Athena](../deities/athena.md) hath given her beyond women, knowledge of all fair handiwork, yea, and cunning wit, and wiles — so be it! Such wiles as hers we have never yet heard that any even of the women of old did know, of those that aforetime were fair-tressed Achaean ladies, Tyro, and Alcmene, and Mycene with the bright crown. Not one of these in the imaginations of their hearts was like unto Penelope."[^od2-antinous]

[^od2-antinous]: "pondering in her heart those things that Athene hath given her beyond women, knowledge of all fair handiwork, yea, and cunning wit, and wiles... Such wiles as hers we have never yet heard that any even of the women of old did know, of those that aforetime were fair-tressed Achaean ladies, Tyro, and Alcmene, and Mycene with the bright crown. Not one of these in the imaginations of their hearts was like unto Penelope" (Odyssey 2.123-128, trans. Butcher and Lang)

### The Gates of Horn and Ivory (Book XIX)

When disguised [Odysseus](odysseus.md) interprets her dream of the eagle slaying her geese, Penelope responds with the famous passage on the two gates of dreams: "Stranger, verily dreams are hard, and hard to be discerned; nor are all things therein fulfilled for men. Twain are the gates of shadowy dreams, the one is fashioned of horn and one of ivory. Such dreams as pass through the portals of sawn ivory are deceitful, and bear tidings that are unfulfilled. But the dreams that come forth through the gates of polished horn bring a true issue, whosoever of mortals beholds them."[^od19-gates]

[^od19-gates]: "Twain are the gates of shadowy dreams, the one is fashioned of horn and one of ivory. Such dreams as pass through the portals of sawn ivory are deceitful, and bear tidings that are unfulfilled. But the dreams that come forth through the gates of polished horn bring a true issue, whosoever of mortals beholds them" (Odyssey 19.563-566)

### The Contest and Recognition (Books XXI-XXIII)

Key moments include [Athena](../deities/athena.md) beautifying her (Book XVIII), the contest of the bow (Book XXI), and her final test of Odysseus with the secret of the immovable bed (Book XXIII).
