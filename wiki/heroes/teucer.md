## Overview

**Teucer** is the son of [Telamon](telamon.md) and Hesione, daughter of Laomedon of Troy, making him the half-brother of [Ajax](ajax.md) son of Telamon. He is a distinguished archer in the Greek forces at Troy. After Ajax's death, Teucer becomes the principal defender of his brother's right to burial, defying first [Menelaus](menelaus.md) and then [Agamemnon](agamemnon.md).

## In the Bibliotheca

### Origins (3.12.7)

[Telamon](telamon.md) had Teucer by Hesione, daughter of Laomedon, "whom he received as a prize when he accompanied Heracles against Troy."[^apd-birth] Hesione was thus a captive taken from Troy by Heracles and given to Telamon; Teucer's origins as the son of a Trojan princess will be used against him in [Sophocles' Ajax](../sources/sophocles-ajax.md).

### At Troy (E.3.11)

Teucer sailed to Troy with [Ajax](ajax.md) from Salamis. Apollodorus records twelve ships from Salamis, the same contingent that Ajax commanded.[^apd-ships]

[^apd-birth]: "Telamon had Teucer by Hesione, daughter of Laomedon, whom he received as a prize when he accompanied Heracles against Troy" (Bibliotheca 3.12.7, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-ships]: "Of the Salaminians, Telamonian Ajax: he brought twelve ships" (Bibliotheca E.3.11, trans. J.G. Frazer)

## In the Iliad

### Archery from Behind Ajax's Shield (Book VIII)

In the Iliad, Teucer is the foremost Greek archer. He fights sheltered behind [Ajax](ajax.md)'s great sevenfold shield, stepping out to shoot and then retreating behind it again — "even as a child runs to his mother, so did Teucer run to Aias."[^il8-shield] From this position he inflicts steady casualties on the Trojans, and [Agamemnon](agamemnon.md) praises him as worth "gold and bronze" to the Greeks.[^il8-praise]

[^il8-shield]: "even as a child runs to his mother, so did Teucer run to Aias" (Iliad 8.266-267, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il8-praise]: Agamemnon praises Teucer as the finest archer of the Achaeans; Iliad 8.275-282, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers

## In Sophocles' Ajax

### Arrival and Lament

Teucer arrives after [Ajax](ajax.md)'s suicide and laments his brother over the body. He fears the reception awaiting him in Salamis: "How shall I stand before our father Telamon? / What welcome word will he vouchsafe to me / When I come stripped of thee?"[^soph-aj-fear] He anticipates that [Telamon](telamon.md) will drive him into exile, stripped of his inheritance, since he has come home without his brother.

He reflects on the fatal symmetry of the exchange of gifts between Ajax and [Hector](hector.md) at their duel: the sword Ajax received from Hector was the sword on which he fell, and the belt Ajax gave Hector was the belt by which [Achilles](achilles.md) dragged Hector's corpse. "This was Hector's gift... the sword he fell on. The gird he gave to Hector was the gird / Whence bound unto the rail he hung and rolled / And ever was chafed, till he gave up the ghost."[^soph-aj-gifts] Both gifts, Teucer observes, proved deadly to their recipients.

### Arranging Eurysakes as Suppliant

Teucer summons Ajax's young son Eurysakes and places him over the body as a suppliant, cutting a lock of his own hair, [Tecmessa](tecmessa.md)'s hair, and Ajax's hair to lay in the child's hands: "take him, hold him fast... stand by him, and touch / This suppliant wreath with steadfast hand."[^soph-aj-suppliant] The gesture invokes the religious protection owed to suppliants and signals that the body must not be violated.

### Defying Menelaus

[Menelaus](menelaus.md) arrives and forbids Ajax's burial, declaring that Ajax had come to Troy as an ally but acted as an enemy and should be left unburied as a lesson in obedience. Teucer defies him sharply: Ajax sailed to Troy as a free commander, not as a subject of Menelaus, and had obligations to no man who did not command him justly.[^soph-aj-defiance] He accuses Menelaus of cowardice — hiding behind others in battle while Ajax bore the brunt of the fighting — and refuses to yield.

[^soph-aj-defiance]: Teucer: Ajax "sailed not under thy command, but in his own, a free man" (Sophocles, Ajax, trans. Lewis Campbell)

### Defying Agamemnon

[Agamemnon](agamemnon.md) joins the confrontation and insults Teucer's birth: "thou speak'st as if thou wert somebody — thou, the she-captive's offspring! Were but thy mother noble, how wouldst thou have puffed thyself up with this boast!"[^soph-aj-insult] He dismisses Teucer's claim to any standing on the grounds that his mother Hesione was a foreign captive.

Teucer responds by attacking Agamemnon's own lineage: "Who was thy father's father? A barbarian, Pelops, the Phrygian, if you trace him far! And what was Atreus, thine own father? One who served his brother with the abominable dire feast of his own flesh."[^soph-aj-retort] He catalogues Ajax's battlefield deeds — defending the ships when Hector set fire to them, volunteering for single combat with Hector by the lot — as evidence that Ajax's claim to honour is real and Agamemnon's hostility is personal ingratitude.

### Odysseus's Intervention and the Burial

[Odysseus](odysseus.md) arrives and argues for burial. Teucer receives this unexpected support with genuine warmth: "Odysseus, best of men, thine every word hath my heart's praise, and my worst thought of thee is foiled by thy staunch kindness to the man who was thy rancorous foe."[^soph-aj-praise] However, when Odysseus offers to help with the actual funeral rites, Teucer declines: he fears that participating in the rites might offend Ajax's spirit, given the enmity between Ajax and Odysseus. Odysseus accepts the refusal gracefully and departs.[^soph-aj-decline]

Teucer directs the burial, commanding Eurysakes to help lift his father's body.

[^soph-aj-fear]: "How shall I stand before our father Telamon? / What welcome word will he vouchsafe to me / When I come stripped of thee?" (Sophocles, Ajax, trans. Lewis Campbell)
[^soph-aj-gifts]: "This was Hector's gift... the sword he fell on. The gird he gave to Hector was the gird / Whence bound unto the rail he hung and rolled / And ever was chafed, till he gave up the ghost" (Sophocles, Ajax)
[^soph-aj-suppliant]: "take him, hold him fast... stand by him, and touch / This suppliant wreath with steadfast hand" (Sophocles, Ajax)
[^soph-aj-insult]: "thou speak'st as if thou wert somebody — thou, the she-captive's offspring! Were but thy mother noble, how wouldst thou have puffed thyself up with this boast!" (Sophocles, Ajax)
[^soph-aj-retort]: "Who was thy father's father? A barbarian, Pelops, the Phrygian, if you trace him far! And what was Atreus, thine own father? One who served his brother with the abominable dire feast of his own flesh" (Sophocles, Ajax)
[^soph-aj-praise]: "Odysseus, best of men, thine every word hath my heart's praise, and my worst thought of thee is foiled by thy staunch kindness to the man who was thy rancorous foe" (Sophocles, Ajax)
[^soph-aj-decline]: Sophocles, Ajax. Teucer declines Odysseus's offer to help with the rites, fearing Ajax's ghost might be offended by the participation of his chief enemy.

## In Euripides' [Helen](../sources/euripides-helen.md)

Teucer appears in Egypt, banished by his father [Telamon](telamon.md) for returning from [Troy](../places/troy.md) without [Ajax](ajax.md): "My brother Ajax, who died at Troy, was author of my ruin."[^eur-hel-teu-exile] He mistakes the real [Helen](helen.md) for the notorious woman and nearly attacks her: "Such a resemblance bear'st thou to that Helen, that if I were not in a foreign land, I with this stone would smite thee."[^eur-hel-teu-stone]

He brings news of Troy's destruction ("Not a trace of those proud walls is now to be discerned"), [Menelaus](menelaus.md)'s rumoured death at sea, and Leda's suicide by hanging. Of the Dioscuri he says: "They are, and are not, dead; for two accounts are propagated... Some say that they are gods under the semblance of two radiant stars."[^eur-hel-teu-dioscuri] He is heading to Cyprus, where [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) has told him to settle and found a city he will call Salamis in memory of his homeland.

[^eur-hel-teu-stone]: "Such a resemblance bear'st thou to that Helen, that if I were not in a foreign land, I with this stone would smite thee" (Helen ~1062-1065, trans. Michael Wodhull)
[^eur-hel-teu-dioscuri]: "They are, and are not, dead; for two accounts are propagated... Some say that they are gods under the semblance of two radiant stars" (Helen ~1228-1235, trans. Michael Wodhull)

## In the Posthomerica

### Grief at Ajax's Death (Book V)

In the Posthomerica, Teucer's grief at [Ajax](ajax.md)'s suicide is so extreme that he nearly kills himself. The Posthomerica records his desperate lament over the body.[^post-grief]
