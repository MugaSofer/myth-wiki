## Overview

**Atalanta** is a huntress who was exposed at birth, suckled by a bear, and raised by hunters. A virgin warrior, she hunted the [Calydonian Boar](../events/calydonian-boar.md) and wrestled Peleus to a draw, before being defeated in a footrace by golden apples from [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md).

## In the Bibliotheca

### Birth and Upbringing (3.9.2)

"This Atalanta was exposed by her father, because he desired male children; and a she bear came often and gave her suck, till hunters found her and brought her up among themselves."[^apd-birth]

"Grown to womanhood, Atalanta kept herself a virgin, and hunting in the wilderness she remained always under arms. The centaurs Rhoecus and Hylaeus tried to force her, but were shot down and killed by her."[^apd-centaurs]

### The Calydonian Boar and Pelias's Games (1.8.2-3, 3.9.2)

"She went moreover with the chiefs to hunt the Calydonian boar." In the [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md)'s account of that hunt (1.8.2), "Atalanta was the first to shoot the boar" and Meleager awarded her the hide.[^apd-boar]

"At the games held in honor of Pelias she wrestled with Peleus and won."[^apd-wrestling]

### The Footrace (3.9.2)

When her father would have persuaded her to marry, "she went away to a place that might serve as a racecourse, and, having planted a stake three cubits high in the middle of it, she caused her wooers to race before her from there, and ran herself in arms; and if the wooer was caught up, his due was death on the spot, and if he was not caught up, his due was marriage."[^apd-race]

"When many had already perished, Melanion came to run for love of her, bringing golden apples from [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md), and being pursued he threw them down, and she, picking up the dropped fruit, was beaten in the race. So Melanion married her."[^apd-apples]

### Transformation (3.9.2)

"And once on a time it is said that out hunting they entered into the precinct of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md), and there taking their fill of love were changed into lions."[^apd-lions]

### Variant Traditions

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) notes multiple variants: "Hesiod and some others have said that Atalanta was not a daughter of Iasus, but of Schoeneus; and Euripides says that she was a daughter of Maenalus, and that her husband was not Melanion but Hippomenes."[^apd-variants]

Her son Parthenopaeus fought in the [Seven Against Thebes](../sources/apollodorus.md) and was slain — "by Melanion, or [Ares](../deities/ares.md), Atalanta had a son Parthenopaeus, who went to the war against Thebes."[^apd-parth]
