## Overview

**Atalanta** is a huntress who was exposed at birth, suckled by a bear, and raised by hunters. A virgin warrior, she hunted the [Calydonian Boar](../events/calydonian-boar.md) and wrestled Peleus to a draw, before being defeated in a footrace by golden apples from [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md).

## In the Bibliotheca

### Birth and Upbringing (3.9.2)

"This Atalanta was exposed by her father, because he desired male children; and a she bear came often and gave her suck, till hunters found her and brought her up among themselves."[^apd-birth]

"Grown to womanhood, Atalanta kept herself a virgin, and hunting in the wilderness she remained always under arms. The centaurs Rhoecus and Hylaeus tried to force her, but were shot down and killed by her."[^apd-centaurs]

### The Calydonian Boar and Pelias's Games (1.8.2-3, 3.9.2)

"She went moreover with the chiefs to hunt the Calydonian boar." In the [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md)'s account of that hunt (1.8.2), "Atalanta was the first to shoot the boar" and Meleager awarded her the hide.[^apd-boar]

"At the games held in honor of Pelias she wrestled with Peleus and won."[^apd-wrestling]

### The Footrace (3.9.2)

When her father would have persuaded her to marry, "she went away to a place that might serve as a racecourse, and, having planted a stake three cubits high in the middle of it, she caused her wooers to race before her from there, and ran herself in arms; and if the wooer was caught up, his due was death on the spot, and if he was not caught up, his due was marriage."[^apd-race]

"When many had already perished, Melanion came to run for love of her, bringing golden apples from [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md), and being pursued he threw them down, and she, picking up the dropped fruit, was beaten in the race. So Melanion married her."[^apd-apples]

### Transformation (3.9.2)

"And once on a time it is said that out hunting they entered into the precinct of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md), and there taking their fill of love were changed into lions."[^apd-lions]

### Variant Traditions

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) notes multiple variants: "Hesiod and some others have said that Atalanta was not a daughter of Iasus, but of Schoeneus; and Euripides says that she was a daughter of Maenalus, and that her husband was not Melanion but Hippomenes."[^apd-variants]

Her son Parthenopaeus fought in the [Seven Against Thebes](../sources/apollodorus.md) and was slain — "by Melanion, or [Ares](../deities/ares.md), Atalanta had a son Parthenopaeus, who went to the war against Thebes."[^apd-parth]

## In the Catalogue of Women

The Hesiodic Catalogue preserves a poetic version of the footrace between Atalanta and Hippomenes (the name used here instead of Melanion). Atalanta is described as "fair Atalanta, swift of foot, the daughter of Schoeneus, who had the beaming eyes of the Graces, though she was ripe for wedlock rejected the company of her equals and sought to avoid marriage with men who eat bread."[^cat-beauty]

The race itself is vividly told: "she, even fair, swift-footed Atalanta, ran scorning the gifts of golden [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md); but with him the race was for his life, either to find his doom, or to escape it." Hippomenes cast the golden apples one by one, and "swiftly as a Harpy, she turned back and snatched it." After he cast the third apple, "therewith escaped death and black fate."[^cat-race]

[^cat-beauty]: "fair Atalanta, swift of foot, the daughter of Schoeneus, who had the beaming eyes of the Graces, though she was ripe for wedlock rejected the company of her equals and sought to avoid marriage with men who eat bread" (Catalogue of Women, Fragment 14, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^cat-race]: "she, even fair, swift-footed Atalanta, ran scorning the gifts of golden Aphrodite; but with him the race was for his life, either to find his doom, or to escape it... But he, following lightly on his feet, cast the first apple: and, swiftly as a Harpy, she turned back and snatched it" (Catalogue of Women, Fragment 14, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## In the Fabulae

### Auge and the Doe-Suckled Child (§99)

The [Fabulae](../sources/hyginus.md) recounts a variant tradition about Atalanta's motherhood. The text describes how "Auge, daughter of Aleus, ravished by [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md), when her time was near, gave birth to a child on Mount Parthenius, and there exposed him."[^hyg-auge] Remarkably, two exposed children were saved by the same animal: "At the same time Atalanta, daughter of Iasius, exposed a son by Meleager. A doe, however, sucked the child of [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md)."[^hyg-doe]

The shepherds who found both infants gave them names reflecting their circumstances: "Shepherds found these boys and took them away and reared them, giving the name Telephus to the son of [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) because a doe had suckled him, and to Atalanta's child the name Parthenopaeus, because she had exposed him on Mount Parthenius pretending to be virgin."[^hyg-names]

This passage provides a rare variant: Parthenopaeus as son of Atalanta and Meleager (rather than by Melanion or [Ares](../deities/ares.md) as in other sources).

[^hyg-auge]: "Auge, daughter of Aleus, ravished by Hercules, when her time was near, gave birth to a child on Mount Parthenius, and there exposed him" (Fabulae §99, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-doe]: "At the same time Atalanta, daughter of Iasius, exposed a son by Meleager. A doe, however, sucked the child of Hercules" (Fabulae §99, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-names]: "Shepherds found these boys and took them away and reared them, giving the name Telephus to the son of Hercules because a doe had suckled him, and to Atalanta's child the name Parthenopaeus, because she had exposed him on Mount Parthenius pretending to be virgin" (Fabulae §99, trans. Mary Grant)

### The Calydonian Hunters (§173)

The Fabulae preserves a catalog of those who hunted the Calydonian Boar, listing Atalanta among an illustrious company of heroes: "Castor and Pollux, sons of Jove. Eurytus son of Mercury... Aesculapius, son of Apollo. Jason, son of Aeson... Peleus, son of Aeacus. Telamon, son of Aeacus... Theseus, son of Aegeus... Meleager, son of Oineus... Atalanta, daughter of Schoeneus."[^hyg-hunters] The list demonstrates Atalanta's participation as the sole woman among Greece's greatest heroes.

[^hyg-hunters]: "Castor and Pollux, sons of Jove. Eurytus son of Mercury... Aesculapius, son of Apollo. Jason, son of Aeson... Peleus, son of Aeacus. Telamon, son of Aeacus... Theseus, son of Aegeus... Meleager, son of Oineus... Atalanta, daughter of Schoeneus" (Fabulae §173, trans. Mary Grant)

### Meleager Awards the Hide (§174)

The Fabulae recounts the aftermath of the hunt and Meleager's fatal decision. After the boar was killed, "Meleager, with the help of chosen youths of Greece, killed it, and gave the hide to the virgin Atalanta because of her valor."[^hyg-hide]

But the uncles objected: "Ideus, Plexippus, Lynceus... brothers of Althaea, wished to take if from her."[^hyg-uncles] When Atalanta "asked the help of Meleager, he intervened, and putting love before family relationship, killed his uncles."[^hyg-meleager] This act triggered the tragic conclusion: Althaea, "remembering the warning of the Parcae, she brought out the brand from the chest and threw it on the fire. Thus, in desiring to avenge the death of her brothers, she killed her son."[^hyg-brand]

[^hyg-hide]: "Meleager, with the help of chosen youths of Greece, killed it, and gave the hide to the virgin Atalanta because of her valor" (Fabulae §174, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-uncles]: "Ideus, Plexippus, Lynceus... brothers of Althaea, wished to take if from her" (Fabulae §174, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-meleager]: "When she asked the help of Meleager, he intervened, and putting love before family relationship, killed his uncles" (Fabulae §174, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-brand]: "When Althaea, the mother, heard that her son had dared to commit such a crime, remembering the warning of the Parcae, she brought out the brand from the chest and threw it on the fire. Thus, in desiring to avenge the death of her brothers, she killed her son" (Fabulae §174, trans. Mary Grant)

## In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md)

### The Oracle and the Race (10.560-680)

The Metamorphoses tells the footrace as a tale within a tale — [Venus](../deities/aphrodite.md) narrates it to Adonis as a warning against recklessness. Atalanta, daughter of Schoeneus, is described as supernaturally swift: "you could not have said whether her swift speed or her beauty was more worthy of your praise."[^met-atal-beauty] An oracle warned her: "You, Atalanta, never will have need of husband, who will only be your harm... while yet living you will lose yourself."[^met-atal-oracle]

She sets the fatal terms: "I will not be won till I am conquered first in speed... A wife and couch shall both be given to reward the swift, but death must recompense the one who lags behind."[^met-atal-terms]

### Hippomenes (10.575-638)

Hippomenes, grandson of [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md), comes to mock the suitors but is instantly smitten. Atalanta running is described vividly: "The breeze bore back the streamers on her flying ankles, while her hair was tossed back over her white shoulders; the bright trimmed ribbons at her knees were fluttering, and over her white girlish body came a pink flush."[^met-atal-running]

Atalanta herself is moved by Hippomenes, debating inwardly: "Oh how dear how lovable is his young girlish face! -- ah, doomed Hippomenes, I only wish mischance had never let you see me! You are truly worthy of a life on earth." She loves without knowing she loves: "she loves and does not know she is in love."[^met-atal-love]

### Venus's Golden Apples (10.638-680)

Hippomenes prays directly to Venus, who gives him three golden apples from her sacred field of Tamasus in Cyprus: "I had three golden apples in my hand, which I had plucked. Since I was coming from there, by some chance... while quite invisible to all but him, I taught him how to use those golden apples."[^met-atal-venus]

During the race, Atalanta deliberately slows: "how often, when she could have passed him, she delayed her speed; and after gazing long upon his face reluctantly again would pass him!"[^met-atal-delay] Hippomenes throws the three apples in succession, the last at an oblique angle so pursuit would mean a slow return. Venus admits she forced the final pick-up: "I forced her to turn for it; take it up; and, adding weight to the gold fruit, she held, impeded her with weight and loss of time."[^met-atal-weight]

### Transformation into Lions (10.681-707)

Hippomenes forgot to thank Venus with incense, and the goddess punished them. Seized by uncontrollable lust near a temple of Cybele (Rhea, Mother of the Gods), they desecrated the sacred cave. Cybele "at first prepared to plunge the guilty pair beneath the waves of Styx, but such a punishment seemed light." Instead she transformed them: "their necks, that had been smooth, were covered instantly with tawny manes; their fingers bent to claws; their arms were changed to fore-legs." They became lions, "terrible to all of life; except to Cybele; whose harness has subdued their champing jaws."[^met-atal-lions]

[^met-atal-beauty]: "you could not have said whether her swift speed or her beauty was more worthy of your praise" (Metamorphoses 10.565-566, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-atal-oracle]: "You, Atalanta, never will have need of husband, who will only be your harm. For your best good you should avoid the tie; but surely you will not avoid your harm; and while yet living you will lose yourself" (Metamorphoses 10.567-572, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-atal-terms]: "I will not be won till I am conquered first in speed. Contest the race with me. A wife and couch shall both be given to reward the swift, but death must recompense the one who lags behind" (Metamorphoses 10.577-581, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-atal-running]: "The breeze bore back the streamers on her flying ankles, while her hair was tossed back over her white shoulders; the bright trimmed ribbons at her knees were fluttering, and over her white girlish body came a pink flush" (Metamorphoses 10.591-598, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-atal-love]: "she loves and does not know she is in love" (Metamorphoses 10.635, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-atal-venus]: "I had three golden apples in my hand, which I had plucked... while quite invisible to all but him, I taught him how to use those golden apples for his benefit" (Metamorphoses 10.650-656, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-atal-delay]: "how often, when she could have passed him, she delayed her speed; and after gazing long upon his face reluctantly again would pass him!" (Metamorphoses 10.667-670, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-atal-weight]: "I forced her to turn for it; take it up; and, adding weight to the gold fruit, she held, impeded her with weight and loss of time" (Metamorphoses 10.687-689, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-atal-lions]: "their necks, that had been smooth, were covered instantly with tawny manes; their fingers bent to claws; their arms were changed to fore-legs... And now fierce lions they are terrible to all of life; except to Cybele; whose harness has subdued their champing jaws" (Metamorphoses 10.698-707, trans. Brookes More)
