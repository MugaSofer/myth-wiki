## Overview

**Eteocles** was the younger son of [Oedipus](../heroes/oedipus.md) and [Jocasta](../heroes/jocasta.md), and brother to [Polyneices](../heroes/polyneices.md), [Antigone](../heroes/antigone.md), and [Ismene](../heroes/ismene.md). He expelled his elder brother from [Thebes](../places/thebes.md) and held the throne against the [Seven against Thebes](../events/seven-against-thebes.md), dying in single combat with Polyneices — a mutual fratricide that ended their family's rule. [Creon](../heroes/creon.md) honored him with full burial rites while denying the same to Polyneices.

## In the Bibliotheca

The Bibliotheca records that after Oedipus died, "his sons Eteocles and Polynices came to blows with each other" over the kingship (3.6.1). Eteocles drove Polyneices out. He held Thebes against the Seven and fell in single combat with his brother, "Eteocles and Polynices slew each other" (3.7.1).[^apd-mutual]

## In the Fabulae

Hyginus records that the brothers agreed to share the throne in alternating years, with Eteocles ruling first (§68). At the end of his year he refused to yield power and expelled Polyneices.[^hyg-eteocles] The two brothers died in mutual combat during the siege.[^hyg-death]

## In Sophocles' Oedipus at Colonus

[Ismene](../heroes/ismene.md) reports the brothers' conflict to their father. Initially both sons had agreed to leave rule to [Creon](../heroes/creon.md), intending to remove the family curse. But then "some god and an infatuate soul / Have stirred betwixt them a mad rivalry / To grasp at sovereignty and kingly power. / Today the hot-branded youth, the younger born, / Is keeping Polyneices from the throne."[^soc-rivalry] Oedipus, hearing that both sons knew of the oracle promising victory to whoever held his grave but chose power over their father's welfare, curses both: "Then may the gods ne'er quench their fatal feud."[^soc-curse]

## In Sophocles' Antigone

Eteocles does not appear as a character but is central to the play's premise. [Creon](../heroes/creon.md) contrasts him with [Polyneices](../heroes/polyneices.md): "Eteocles, / Who in his country's battle fought and fell, / The foremost champion — duly bury him / With all observances and ceremonies / That are the guerdon of the heroic dead."[^sa-honor] The chorus recalls that the brothers "both perished, brother slain by brother."[^sa-chorus]

[Antigone](../heroes/antigone.md) says of both: "The one by Creon graced with funeral rites, / The other disappointed."[^sa-antigone]

## In Euripides' Phoenissae

Eteocles appears as the reigning king of Thebes, firm in his refusal to share power. [Jocasta](../heroes/jocasta.md) attempts to mediate between her sons; Eteocles refuses to yield the throne. He falls in single combat with Polyneices, and Jocasta kills herself over their bodies.[^phoen-death]

## Variant Traditions

Apollodorus notes that some say the children were borne not by Jocasta but by Eurygania, daughter of Hyperphas (3.5.8). The question of which brother first broke the alternating-year arrangement varies; in Sophocles, Ismene says simply that the younger brother expelled the elder, while Polyneices tells the same story from his own perspective as the wronged party.
