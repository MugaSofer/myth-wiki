## Overview

**Adonis** was a youth of extraordinary beauty, born from the incestuous union of Myrrha and her father Cinyras. He was loved by [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md), who abandoned heaven to hunt alongside him, and was killed by a wild boar. From his blood sprang the anemone.

### Birth from Myrrha's Tree (10.476-519)

Adonis was born from the trunk of a myrrh tree. His mother Myrrha, consumed with forbidden desire for her father Cinyras, had tricked him into her bed with the help of her nurse during a festival of [Demeter](../deities/demeter.md). When Cinyras discovered the truth, he drew his sword, but Myrrha fled and wandered for nine months until, exhausted and pregnant, she prayed to be changed. The gods transformed her into a myrrh tree: "roots grew out and, stretching forth obliquely from her nails, gave strong support to her up-growing trunk." Her tears became myrrh that "distilling from the trunk, keeps to her name."[^met-ad-myrrha]

The tree split open in labour, aided by Lucina, and "gave forth its living weight, a wailing baby-boy." The Naiads anointed him with his mother's tears. He was "as beautiful as naked cupids seen in chosen paintings."[^met-ad-birth]

### Venus and Adonis (10.519-559)

When Adonis grew to manhood — "that son of sister and grandfather... is now a youth, now man more beautiful than during growth" — he won the love of [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md). Cupid accidentally grazed her breast with a projecting arrow while kissing her, and "the scratch had pierced her deeper than she thought."[^met-ad-venus]

Venus abandoned her divine haunts: "neglecting heaven, prefers Adonis to heaven." She became his hunting companion, going "through the woods and over mountain ridges and wild fields, rocky and thorn-set, bare to her white knees after Diana's manner." She hunted only harmless prey — hares, stags, does — and warned Adonis to avoid fierce beasts: "Dear boy, do not be rash, do not attack the wild beasts which are armed by nature, lest your glory may cost me great sorrow."[^met-ad-warning]

To explain her fear, she reclined against his breast and told the tale of [Atalanta](atalanta.md) and Hippomenes — how the golden apples she gave were used to win the race, and how the couple's ingratitude led to their transformation into lions.

### Death and the Anemone (10.705-739)

Venus warned Adonis and departed in her swan-drawn chariot, "but his rash courage would not heed advice." His dogs raised a wild boar, and Adonis "pierced him with a glancing stroke." The boar turned and "sank his deadly tusk deep in Adonis' groin; and stretched him dying on the yellow sand."[^met-ad-death]

Venus heard his groans from the air and turned back. "Down looking from the lofty sky, she saw him nearly dead, his body bathed in blood, she leaped down — tore her garment — tore her hair — and beat her bosom with distracted hands." She declared: "But not everything is at the mercy of your cruel power. My sorrow for Adonis will remain, enduring as a lasting monument. Each passing year the memory of his death shall cause an imitation of my grief."[^met-ad-grief]

She sprinkled nectar on his blood, and "from Adonis' blood, exactly of its color, a loved flower sprang up, such as pomegranates give to us." The flower was the anemone, whose name comes from the wind: "the winds which give the flower its name, Anemone, shake it right down, because its slender hold, always so weak, lets it fall to the ground from its frail stem."[^met-ad-anemone]

[^met-ad-myrrha]: "roots grew out and, stretching forth obliquely from her nails, gave strong support to her up-growing trunk... There is a virtue even in her tears — the valued myrrh distilling from the trunk, keeps to her name, by which she still is known" (Metamorphoses 10.488-502, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-ad-birth]: "the tree cracked open then, the bark was rent asunder, and it gave forth its living weight, a wailing baby-boy. The Naiads laid him on soft leaves, and they anointed him with his own mother's tears" (Metamorphoses 10.503-513, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-ad-venus]: "while the goddess' son with quiver held on shoulder, once was kissing his loved mother, it chanced unwittingly he grazed her breast with a projecting arrow. Instantly the wounded goddess pushed her son away; but the scratch had pierced her deeper than she thought" (Metamorphoses 10.525-532, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-ad-warning]: "Dear boy, do not be rash, do not attack the wild beasts which are armed by nature, lest your glory may cost me great sorrow. Neither youth nor beauty nor the deeds which have moved Venus have effect on lions, bristling boars" (Metamorphoses 10.543-554, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-ad-death]: "the fierce boar's curved snout first struck the spear-shaft from his bleeding side; and, while the trembling youth was seeking where to find a safe retreat, the savage beast raced after him, until at last he sank his deadly tusk deep in Adonis' groin; and stretched him dying on the yellow sand" (Metamorphoses 10.710-716, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-ad-grief]: "But not everything is at the mercy of your cruel power. My sorrow for Adonis will remain, enduring as a lasting monument. Each passing year the memory of his death shall cause an imitation of my grief" (Metamorphoses 10.722-728, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-ad-anemone]: "from Adonis' blood, exactly of its color, a loved flower sprang up... the winds which give the flower its name, Anemone, shake it right down, because its slender hold, always so weak, lets it fall to the ground from its frail stem" (Metamorphoses 10.735-739, trans. Brookes More)
