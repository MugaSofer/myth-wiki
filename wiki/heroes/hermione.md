## Overview

**Hermione** was the daughter of [Menelaus](../deities/menelaus.md) and [Helen](helen.md), born before the [Trojan War](../events/trojan-war.md). She became a focal point of succession disputes, being betrothed to [Neoptolemus](neoptolemus.md) before the war and later married to [Orestes](orestes.md) after his purification.

## In the Odyssey

When [Menelaus](../deities/menelaus.md) and [Helen](helen.md) were feasting in Sparta, they displayed Hermione before guests. She is described as beautiful: "Hermione, as fair as golden Aphrodite."[^od4-hermione]

[^od4-hermione]: "Hermione, as fair as golden Aphrodite. So they were feasting through the great vaulted hall" (Odyssey 4.129, trans. Butcher and Lang)

## In Euripides' Orestes

When [Orestes](orestes.md) was pursued by the Furies for his matricide, he and [Electra](electra.md) took Hermione as a hostage. [Electra](electra.md) proposed seizing her while she visited [Clytaemnestra](clytaemnestra.md)'s tomb to pour libations. She advised [Orestes](orestes.md): "Seize her as a pledge as she is coming back" and to threaten her life if [Menelaus](../deities/menelaus.md) should move against them.[^orestes-hostage]

[^orestes-hostage]: "Seize her as a pledge as she is coming back...thou oughtest to draw thy sword, and hold it to the neck of the virgin" (Euripides, Orestes, trans. T.A. Buckley)

When [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) appeared and resolved the conflicts, he commanded that [Orestes](orestes.md) should marry Hermione, and [Electra](electra.md) should dwell with [Pylades](pylades.md).[^orestes-marriage]

[^orestes-marriage]: "Apollo, however, having appeared, said that he had conducted Helen to the Gods, and commanded Orestes to take Hermione to wife, and Electra to dwell with Pylades" (Euripides, Orestes, trans. T.A. Buckley)

## In Apollodorus

According to [Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md), Hermione was born to [Menelaus](../deities/menelaus.md) and [Helen](helen.md), and was betrothed to [Neoptolemus](neoptolemus.md) while he was at Troy.[^apd-birth] After the [Trojan War](../events/trojan-war.md), when [Neoptolemus](neoptolemus.md) carried her off, [Orestes](orestes.md) pursued them in madness and slew [Neoptolemus](neoptolemus.md) at Delphi.[^apd-neoptolemus] [Orestes](orestes.md) then married Hermione himself and ruled Argos, begetting [Tisamenus](tisamenus.md).[^apd-orestes-marriage]

[^apd-birth]: "Now Menelaus had by Helen a daughter Hermione and, according to some, a son Nicostratus" (Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 3.11.1, trans. J.G. Frazer)

[^apd-neoptolemus]: "And when Orestes went mad, Neoptolemus carried off his wife Hermione, who had previously been betrothed to him in Troy; and for that reason he was slain by Orestes at Delphi" (Apollodorus, Bibliotheca E.6.14, trans. J.G. Frazer)

[^apd-orestes-marriage]: "and having come to Mycenae, he united his sister Electra in marriage to Pylades, and having himself married Hermione, or, according to some, Erigone, he begat Tisamenus" (Apollodorus, Bibliotheca E.6.28, trans. J.G. Frazer)

## Variant Traditions

[Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) reports that some sources name [Erigone](erigone.md) as [Orestes](orestes.md)' wife rather than Hermione, though he presents Hermione as the more common account.
