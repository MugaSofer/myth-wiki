## Overview

**Heracles** is the son of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) and the mortal Alcmena. He appears repeatedly in the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md) as a slayer of monsters.

## Birth

"Alcmena was joined in love with [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) who drives the clouds and bare mighty Heracles."[^theog-birth]

[^theog-birth]: "Alcmena was joined in love with Zeus who drives the clouds and bare mighty Heracles" (Theogony 943-944, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Mythology

### Monster-Slaying

In the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md), Heracles is mentioned as:
- Slaying Geryones "in sea-girt Erythea by his shambling oxen" after crossing "the ford of Ocean."[^theog-geryones]
- Destroying the [Hydra](../creatures/hydra.md) of Lerna "together with warlike Iolaus... through the plans of [Athena](../deities/athena.md) the spoil-driver."[^theog-hydra]
- Overcoming the [Nemean Lion](../creatures/nemean-lion.md): "the strength of stout Heracles overcame him."[^theog-lion]
- Slaying the eagle that tortured [Prometheus](../deities/prometheus.md), freeing him — "not without the will of Olympian [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) who reigns on high, that the glory of Heracles the Theban-born might be yet greater than it was before over the plenteous earth."[^theog-prometheus]

[^theog-geryones]: "Him mighty Heracles slew in sea-girt Erythea by his shambling oxen on that day when he drove the wide-browed oxen to holy Tiryns, and had crossed the ford of Ocean" (Theogony 289-292)
[^theog-hydra]: "And her Heracles, the son of Zeus, of the house of Amphitryon, together with warlike Iolaus, destroyed with the unpitying sword through the plans of Athene the spoil-driver" (Theogony 316-318)
[^theog-lion]: "yet the strength of stout Heracles overcame him" (Theogony 332)
[^theog-prometheus]: "That bird Heracles, the valiant son of shapely-ankled Alcmene, slew; and delivered the son of Iapetus from the cruel plague, and released him from his affliction—not without the will of Olympian Zeus who reigns on high, that the glory of Heracles the Theban-born might be yet greater than it was before over the plenteous earth" (Theogony 526-532)

### Apotheosis

"Mighty Heracles, the valiant son of neat-ankled Alcmena, when he had finished his grievous toils, made Hebe the child of great [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) and gold-shod [Hera](../deities/hera.md) his shy wife in snowy [Olympus](../places/olympus.md). Happy he! For he has finished his great works and lives amongst the undying gods, untroubled and unageing all his days."[^theog-apotheosis]

[^theog-apotheosis]: "mighty Heracles, the valiant son of neat-ankled Alcmena, when he had finished his grievous toils, made Hebe the child of great Zeus and gold-shod Hera his shy wife in snowy Olympus. Happy he! For he has finished his great works and lives amongst the undying gods, untroubled and unageing all his days." (Theogony 950-955)

### Oppressing Pylos (Book XI)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book XI, Nestor recalls Heracles' devastation of Pylos: "the mighty Herakles had come and oppressed us, in the former years, and all our best men were slain. For twelve sons were we of noble Neleus, whereof I alone was left, and all the others perished."[^il11-pylos]

[^il11-pylos]: "the mighty Herakles had come and oppressed us, in the former years, and all our best men were slain. For twelve sons were we of noble Neleus, whereof I alone was left, and all the others perished" (Iliad XI.6817-6819, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

### Fetching Cerberus (Book VIII)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book VIII, [Athena](../deities/athena.md) recalls how she helped Heracles with Eurystheus's tasks: "Neither remembereth he at all those many times and oft that I saved his son fordone with Eurystheus' tasks." She specifically mentions the descent to Hades: "what time Eurystheus sent him forth to the house of [Hades](../deities/hades.md) the Warder of the Gate, to bring from Erebos the hound of loathed Hades, then had he not escaped the sheer stream of the water of [Styx](../deities/styx.md)."[^il8-cerberus]

This is the first explicit reference to the Cerberus labour in any source processed so far. It also confirms Athena's role as Heracles' divine protector.

[^il8-cerberus]: "Neither remembereth he at all those many times and oft that I saved his son fordone with Eurystheus' tasks. For he would make lament toward heaven, and me would Zeus speed forth from heaven to succour him. Had I but known all this in my prudent heart, what time Eurystheus sent him forth to the house of Hades the Warder of the Gate, to bring from Erebos the hound of loathed Hades, then had he not escaped the sheer stream of the water of Styx" (Iliad VIII.4757-4763, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
