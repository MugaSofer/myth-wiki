## Overview

**Heracles** is the son of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) and the mortal Alcmena. He appears repeatedly in the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md) as a slayer of monsters.

## Epithets

- **"mighty Heracles"** — the standard epithet (Theogony 289, 332, 943; Shield of Heracles passim)
- **"the bold-hearted son of Zeus"** — (Shield of Heracles 443)[^sh-athena]
- **"the valiant son of neat-ankled Alcmena"** — (Theogony 950)[^theog-apotheosis]
- **"the child of Zeus, hardy of heart"** — the Odyssey's characterization, in context of his darker deeds (Odyssey XXI)[^od21-iphitus]
- **"much the mightiest of men on earth"** — (Hymn XV 2)[^hh15-mightiest]

[^hh15-mightiest]: "I will sing of Heracles, the son of Zeus and much the mightiest of men on earth" (Homeric Hymn XV to Heracles 1-2, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Appearance

In the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md), his phantom appears in [Hades](../deities/hades.md) with terrifying aspect: "like black Night, with bow uncased, and shaft upon the string, fiercely glancing around, like one in the act to shoot."[^od11-appearance]

At his birth he was described as "one terrible and strong" — distinct even from his twin Iphiclus, who was "weaker."[^sh-unlike]

## Birth

"Alcmena was joined in love with [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) who drives the clouds and bare mighty Heracles."[^theog-birth]

### The Conception (Shield of Heracles)

The [Shield of Heracles](../sources/shield-of-heracles.md) gives the fullest account of Heracles' conception. [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) descended from Olympus "pondering guile in the deep of his heart," to beget "one to defend against destruction gods and men who eat bread." In one night Zeus lay with Alcmena, and in the same night her husband Amphitryon returned from war: "she, being subject in love to a god and to a man exceeding goodly, brought forth twin sons in seven-gated Thebe."[^sh-twins]

The twins were unlike: "one was weaker but the other a far better man, one terrible and strong, the mighty Heracles. Him she bare through the embrace of the son of Cronos lord of dark clouds and the other, Iphiclus, of Amphitryon the spear-wielder."[^sh-unlike]

[^theog-birth]: "Alcmena was joined in love with Zeus who drives the clouds and bare mighty Heracles" (Theogony 943-944, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^sh-twins]: "she, being subject in love to a god and to a man exceeding goodly, brought forth twin sons in seven-gated Thebe" (Shield of Heracles 49-51, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^sh-unlike]: "one was weaker but the other a far better man, one terrible and strong, the mighty Heracles. Him she bare through the embrace of the son of Cronos lord of dark clouds and the other, Iphiclus, of Amphitryon the spear-wielder—offspring distinct" (Shield of Heracles 51-56)

## Mythology

### Monster-Slaying

In the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md), Heracles is mentioned as:
- Slaying Geryones "in sea-girt Erythea by his shambling oxen" after crossing "the ford of Ocean."[^theog-geryones]
- Destroying the [Hydra](../creatures/hydra.md) of Lerna "together with warlike Iolaus... through the plans of [Athena](../deities/athena.md) the spoil-driver."[^theog-hydra]
- Overcoming the [Nemean Lion](../creatures/nemean-lion.md): "the strength of stout Heracles overcame him."[^theog-lion]
- Slaying the eagle that tortured [Prometheus](../deities/prometheus.md), freeing him — "not without the will of Olympian [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) who reigns on high, that the glory of Heracles the Theban-born might be yet greater than it was before over the plenteous earth."[^theog-prometheus]

[^theog-geryones]: "Him mighty Heracles slew in sea-girt Erythea by his shambling oxen on that day when he drove the wide-browed oxen to holy Tiryns, and had crossed the ford of Ocean" (Theogony 289-292)
[^theog-hydra]: "And her Heracles, the son of Zeus, of the house of Amphitryon, together with warlike Iolaus, destroyed with the unpitying sword through the plans of Athene the spoil-driver" (Theogony 316-318)
[^theog-lion]: "yet the strength of stout Heracles overcame him" (Theogony 332)
[^theog-prometheus]: "That bird Heracles, the valiant son of shapely-ankled Alcmene, slew; and delivered the son of Iapetus from the cruel plague, and released him from his affliction—not without the will of Olympian Zeus who reigns on high, that the glory of Heracles the Theban-born might be yet greater than it was before over the plenteous earth" (Theogony 526-532)

### Apotheosis

"Mighty Heracles, the valiant son of neat-ankled Alcmena, when he had finished his grievous toils, made Hebe the child of great [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) and gold-shod [Hera](../deities/hera.md) his shy wife in snowy [Olympus](../places/olympus.md). Happy he! For he has finished his great works and lives amongst the undying gods, untroubled and unageing all his days."[^theog-apotheosis]

[^theog-apotheosis]: "mighty Heracles, the valiant son of neat-ankled Alcmena, when he had finished his grievous toils, made Hebe the child of great Zeus and gold-shod Hera his shy wife in snowy Olympus. Happy he! For he has finished his great works and lives amongst the undying gods, untroubled and unageing all his days." (Theogony 950-955)

### Slaying Cycnus and Wounding Ares (Shield of Heracles)

In the [Shield of Heracles](../sources/shield-of-heracles.md), Heracles encounters Cycnus, the son of [Ares](../deities/ares.md), who was waylaying pilgrims near [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md)'s temple. [Athena](../deities/athena.md) counselled him: "When you have robbed Cycnus of sweet life, then leave him there and his armour also, and you yourself watch man-slaying Ares narrowly as he attacks, and wherever you shall see him uncovered below his cunningly-wrought shield, there wound him with your sharp spear."[^sh-athena]

Heracles killed Cycnus with a spear-thrust to the neck: "the deadly spear cut through the two sinews; for the hero's full strength lighted on his foe. And Cycnus fell as an oak falls or a lofty pine that is stricken by the lurid thunderbolt of Zeus."[^sh-cycnus]

When Ares charged to avenge his son, Athena "reached out from the car and turned aside the force of the spear." Heracles then "shrewdly wounded his thigh where it was exposed under his richly-wrought shield, and tare deep into his flesh with the spear-thrust and cast him flat upon the ground. And Panic and Dread quickly drove his smooth-wheeled chariot and horses near him and lifted him from the wide-pathed earth into his richly-wrought car, and then straight lashed the horses and came to high Olympus."[^sh-ares]

Heracles boasts of a previous encounter: "Another time ere this I declare he has made trial of my spear, when he defended sandy Pylos and stood against me, fiercely longing for fight. Thrice was he stricken by my spear and dashed to earth."[^sh-pylos]

[^sh-athena]: "When you have robbed Cycnus of sweet life, then leave him there and his armour also, and you yourself watch man-slaying Ares narrowly as he attacks, and wherever you shall see him uncovered below his cunningly-wrought shield, there wound him with your sharp spear" (Shield of Heracles 330-336, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^sh-cycnus]: "the deadly spear cut through the two sinews; for the hero's full strength lighted on his foe. And Cycnus fell as an oak falls or a lofty pine that is stricken by the lurid thunderbolt of Zeus; even so he fell, and his armour adorned with bronze clashed about him" (Shield of Heracles 418-423)
[^sh-ares]: "the son of Amphitryon, unsated of fierce battle, shrewdly wounded his thigh where it was exposed under his richly-wrought shield, and tare deep into his flesh with the spear-thrust and cast him flat upon the ground. And Panic and Dread quickly drove his smooth-wheeled chariot and horses near him and lifted him from the wide-pathed earth into his richly-wrought car, and then straight lashed the horses and came to high Olympus" (Shield of Heracles 456-462)
[^sh-pylos]: "Another time ere this I declare he has made trial of my spear, when he defended sandy Pylos and stood against me, fiercely longing for fight. Thrice was he stricken by my spear and dashed to earth, and his shield was pierced" (Shield of Heracles 357-362)

### Slaying Iphitus (Odyssey XXI)

In [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) Book XXI, the bow of Eurytus occasions one of the most negative depictions of Heracles in the sources. Iphitus, son of Eurytus, came searching for lost horses and met Heracles: "the child of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md), hardy of heart, the man Heracles, that had knowledge of great adventures, who smote Iphitus though his guest in his house, in his frowardness, and had no regard for the vengeance of the gods, nor for the table which he spread before him; for after the meal he slew him, his guest though he was, and kept for himself in the halls the horses strong of hoof."[^od21-iphitus]

This is guest-murder — a violation of divine law. Heracles killed Iphitus after sharing a meal, one of the gravest offences against the hospitality that [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) protects as god of strangers.

[^od21-iphitus]: "the child of Zeus, hardy of heart, the man Heracles, that had knowledge of great adventures, who smote Iphitus though his guest in his house, in his frowardness, and had no regard for the vengeance of the gods, nor for the table which he spread before him; for after the meal he slew him, his guest though he was, and kept for himself in the halls the horses strong of hoof" (Odyssey 11211-11216, trans. Butcher and Lang)

### Phantom in Hades (Odyssey XI)

In [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) Book XI, Odysseus encounters Heracles' shade in the underworld. But the poem draws a striking distinction: "his phantom, I say; but as for himself he hath joy at the banquet among the deathless gods, and hath to wife Hebe of the fair ankles, child of great Zeus, and of Here of the golden sandals."[^od11-phantom] He is described in fearsome terms: "like black Night, with bow uncased, and shaft upon the string, fiercely glancing around, like one in the act to shoot."[^od11-appearance]

Heracles recognises a kindred sufferer in Odysseus: "I was the son of Zeus Cronion, yet had I trouble beyond measure, for I was subdued unto a man far worse than I." He recalls the worst of his labours: "he sent me hither to bring back the hound of hell... I lifted the hound and brought him forth from out of the house of Hades; and Hermes sped me on my way and the grey-eyed Athene."[^od11-cerberus]

[^od11-phantom]: "his phantom, I say; but as for himself he hath joy at the banquet among the deathless gods, and hath to wife Hebe of the fair ankles, child of great Zeus, and of Here of the golden sandals" (Odyssey XI.6485-6490, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od11-appearance]: "like black Night, with bow uncased, and shaft upon the string, fiercely glancing around, like one in the act to shoot" (Odyssey XI.6491-6493, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od11-cerberus]: "I was the son of Zeus Cronion, yet had I trouble beyond measure, for I was subdued unto a man far worse than I... he sent me hither to bring back the hound of hell... I lifted the hound and brought him forth from out of the house of Hades; and Hermes sped me on my way and the grey-eyed Athene" (Odyssey XI.6497-6507, trans. Butcher and Lang)

### Oppressing Pylos (Book XI)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book XI, Nestor recalls Heracles' devastation of Pylos: "the mighty Herakles had come and oppressed us, in the former years, and all our best men were slain. For twelve sons were we of noble Neleus, whereof I alone was left, and all the others perished."[^il11-pylos]

[^il11-pylos]: "the mighty Herakles had come and oppressed us, in the former years, and all our best men were slain. For twelve sons were we of noble Neleus, whereof I alone was left, and all the others perished" (Iliad XI.6817-6819, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

### Fetching Cerberus (Book VIII)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book VIII, [Athena](../deities/athena.md) recalls how she helped Heracles with Eurystheus's tasks: "Neither remembereth he at all those many times and oft that I saved his son fordone with Eurystheus' tasks." She specifically mentions the descent to Hades: "what time Eurystheus sent him forth to the house of [Hades](../deities/hades.md) the Warder of the Gate, to bring from Erebos the hound of loathed Hades, then had he not escaped the sheer stream of the water of [Styx](../deities/styx.md)."[^il8-cerberus]

This is the first explicit reference to the Cerberus labour in any source processed so far. It also confirms Athena's role as Heracles' divine protector.

[^il8-cerberus]: "Neither remembereth he at all those many times and oft that I saved his son fordone with Eurystheus' tasks. For he would make lament toward heaven, and me would Zeus speed forth from heaven to succour him. Had I but known all this in my prudent heart, what time Eurystheus sent him forth to the house of Hades the Warder of the Gate, to bring from Erebos the hound of loathed Hades, then had he not escaped the sheer stream of the water of Styx" (Iliad VIII.4757-4763, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

## In the [Argonautica](../sources/argonautica.md)

### The Erymanthian Boar and Departure

Heracles arrived at the muster of Argonauts still carrying the Erymanthian boar[^arg-herc-boar] — still in the midst of his Labours. In a rowing contest on the Propontis, Heracles snapped his oar from sheer strength and had to go ashore to cut a new one.

### Loss of Hylas

While searching for a suitable tree, his companion Hylas went to fetch water and was seized by a water nymph who fell in love with his beauty and pulled him beneath the surface. Heracles searched frantically through the forest, calling out for him. When dawn came the Argo sailed without him — the heroes were divided over whether they should wait or continue.[^arg-herc-hylas]

The sea-god Glaucus appeared and explained Heracles' fate: "At Argos it is his fate to labour for insolent Eurystheus and to accomplish full twelve toils and dwell with the immortals."[^arg-herc-fate] The heroes lamented his absence at several points during the subsequent voyage.

### Remembered Deeds Along the Route

Near Lycus's kingdom, Polydeuces was welcomed because Heracles had once visited Lycus's father Dascylus — he had defeated Titias the boxer, subdued the Mysians, Phrygians, and Bithynians, and won the girdle of [Hippolyte](../heroes/hippolyte.md).[^arg-herc-deeds]

In Libya, Lynceus thought he glimpsed Heracles far off in the distance, "as a man at the month's beginning sees, or thinks he sees, the moon through a bank of cloud."[^arg-herc-libya] The heroes later found that Heracles had been in the garden of the Hesperides the previous day, where he had slain the serpent Ladon that guarded the apples and struck a rock with his foot to create a spring of water.[^arg-herc-hesperides]

[^arg-herc-boar]: "the boar bound with chains he put down from his huge shoulders at the entrance to the market-place of Mycenae" (Argonautica 1.122-124, trans. R.C. Seaton)
[^arg-herc-hylas]: Hylas went to draw water and a nymph, seizing him by the wrist as she gazed on his beauty, drew him down beneath the pool; Heracles searched in vain and was left behind when the Argo sailed at dawn (Argonautica 1.1207-1272, trans. R.C. Seaton)
[^arg-herc-fate]: Glaucus: "Why against the counsel of mighty Zeus do ye purpose to lead bold Heracles to the city of Aeetes? At Argos it is his fate to labour for insolent Eurystheus and to accomplish full twelve toils and dwell with the immortals" (Argonautica 1.1315-1318, trans. R.C. Seaton)
[^arg-herc-deeds]: Heracles had visited Dascylus, defeated Titias in boxing, subdued the Mysians, Phrygians, and Bithynians, and won the girdle of Hippolyte (Argonautica 2.774-795, trans. R.C. Seaton)
[^arg-herc-libya]: Lynceus thought he glimpsed Heracles far off in Libya, "as a man at the month's beginning sees, or thinks he sees, the moon through a bank of cloud" (Argonautica 4.1477-1479, trans. R.C. Seaton)
[^arg-herc-hesperides]: Heracles had slain the serpent Ladon guarding the apples in the garden of the Hesperides the day before; he had struck a rock with his foot to create a spring (Argonautica 4.1396-1432, trans. R.C. Seaton)

## In the Bibliotheca (1.6.1-1.6.2)

### The Gigantomachy

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) gives Heracles a central role in the battle against the [Giants](../creatures/giants.md). An oracle declared that "none of the giants could perish at the hand of gods, but that with the help of a mortal they would be made an end of." [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) "by means of [Athena](../deities/athena.md) summoned Hercules to his help."[^apd-herc-summon]

Heracles first dealt with Alcyoneus, who was immortal so long as he fought in the land of his birth: "Hercules first shot Alcyoneus with an arrow, but when the giant fell on the ground he somewhat revived. However, at [Athena](../deities/athena.md)'s advice Hercules dragged him outside Pallene, and so the giant died."[^apd-herc-alcyoneus]

In the battle's climactic moment, when Porphyrion attacked both Heracles and [Hera](../deities/hera.md), "[Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) smote him with a thunderbolt, and Hercules shot him dead with an arrow."[^apd-herc-porphyrion]

[Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) and Heracles together killed Ephialtes: "Ephialtes was shot by Apollo with an arrow in his left eye and by Hercules in his right."[^apd-herc-ephialtes]

After the individual combats, "all of them Hercules shot with arrows as they were dying."[^apd-herc-finish]

> **NEW DETAIL:** The Gigantomachy is not described in the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md), [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md), or [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md). The Bibliotheca provides the only detailed account in our corpus, and places Heracles at its centre — the mortal ally without whom the gods could not prevail.

[^apd-herc-summon]: "the gods had an oracle that none of the giants could perish at the hand of gods, but that with the help of a mortal they would be made an end of... by means of Athena summoned Hercules to his help" (Bibliotheca 1.6.1, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-herc-alcyoneus]: "Hercules first shot Alcyoneus with an arrow, but when the giant fell on the ground he somewhat revived. However, at Athena's advice Hercules dragged him outside Pallene, and so the giant died" (Bibliotheca 1.6.1, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-herc-porphyrion]: "Zeus smote him with a thunderbolt, and Hercules shot him dead with an arrow" (Bibliotheca 1.6.2, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-herc-ephialtes]: "Ephialtes was shot by Apollo with an arrow in his left eye and by Hercules in his right" (Bibliotheca 1.6.2, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-herc-finish]: "all of them Hercules shot with arrows as they were dying" (Bibliotheca 1.6.2, trans. Frazer)

## In the Bibliotheca (2.4.5-2.8.5)

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) provides the most comprehensive continuous narrative of Heracles' life in the ancient corpus, covering his genealogical background, birth, youth, the Twelve Labours, later adventures, death, apotheosis, and the fate of his descendants.

### Appearance and Physical Description

Heracles' physical nature was extraordinary: "his body measured four cubits, and he flashed a gleam of fire from his eyes; and he did not miss, neither with the bow nor with the javelin."[^apd-herc-body] After slaying the lion of Cithaeron, "he dressed himself in the skin and wore the scalp as a helmet."[^apd-herc-lionskin]

[^apd-herc-body]: "his body measured four cubits, and he flashed a gleam of fire from his eyes; and he did not miss, neither with the bow nor with the javelin" (Bibliotheca 2.4.9, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-herc-lionskin]: "he dressed himself in the skin and wore the scalp as a helmet" (Bibliotheca 2.4.10)

### Weapons and Equipment

Heracles received divine arms from the gods and fashioned one weapon himself: "a sword from [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md), a bow and arrows from [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md), a golden breastplate from [Hephaestus](../deities/hephaestus.md), and a robe from [Athena](../deities/athena.md); for he had himself cut a club at Nemea."[^apd-herc-arms]

[^apd-herc-arms]: "a sword from Hermes, a bow and arrows from Apollo, a golden breastplate from Hephaestus, and a robe from Athena; for he had himself cut a club at Nemea" (Bibliotheca 2.4.11)

### Birth and Youth

#### Hera's Interference and the Birth of Eurystheus

[Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) declared that "the descendant of Perseus then about to be born would reign over Mycenae," but [Hera](../deities/hera.md) "out of jealousy persuaded the Ilithyias to retard Alcmena's delivery, and contrived that Eurystheus, son of Sthenelus, should be born a seven-month child."[^apd-herc-eurystheus] This secured Eurystheus the throne that should have been Heracles'.

[^apd-herc-eurystheus]: "Zeus declared among the gods that the descendant of Perseus then about to be born would reign over Mycenae, and Hera out of jealousy persuaded the Ilithyias to retard Alcmena's delivery, and contrived that Eurystheus, son of Sthenelus, should be born a seven-month child" (Bibliotheca 2.4.5, trans. J.G. Frazer)

#### Amphitryon and Alcmena

Before Heracles' conception, [Amphitryon](amphitryon.md) had been exiled from Mycenae after accidentally killing his father-in-law Electryon with a rebounding club. He fled to [Thebes](../places/thebes.md) with Alcmena, who refused to marry him until he avenged her brothers' deaths at the hands of the Teleboans. Amphitryon waged a successful campaign against them, aided by Creon, Cephalus, and others.[^apd-herc-amphitryon]

[^apd-herc-amphitryon]: "Amphitryon went with Alcmena and Licymnius to Thebes and was purified by Creon... Alcmena said she would marry him when he had avenged her brothers' death" (Bibliotheca 2.4.6)

#### Conception and Twin Birth

"Before Amphitryon reached Thebes, Zeus came by night and prolonging the one night threefold he assumed the likeness of Amphitryon and bedded with Alcmena."[^apd-herc-zeus-night] When Amphitryon returned and found his wife unsurprised to see him, "he learned from Tiresias how Zeus had enjoyed her." Alcmena bore twins: "Hercules, whom she had by Zeus and who was the elder by one night, and Iphicles, whom she had by Amphitryon."[^apd-herc-twins]

[^apd-herc-zeus-night]: "before Amphitryon reached Thebes, Zeus came by night and prolonging the one night threefold he assumed the likeness of Amphitryon and bedded with Alcmena and related what had happened concerning the Teleboans" (Bibliotheca 2.4.8)
[^apd-herc-twins]: "Alcmena bore two sons, to wit, Hercules, whom she had by Zeus and who was the elder by one night, and Iphicles, whom she had by Amphitryon" (Bibliotheca 2.4.8)

#### The Serpent Episode

"When the child was eight months old, Hera desired the destruction of the babe and sent two huge serpents to the bed. Alcmena called Amphitryon to her help, but Hercules arose and killed the serpents by strangling them with both his hands."[^apd-herc-serpents] A variant tradition attributed to Pherecydes says that Amphitryon himself put the serpents in the bed to determine which child was his; when Iphicles fled and Heracles stood his ground, Amphitryon knew Iphicles was his son.

[^apd-herc-serpents]: "When the child was eight months old, Hera desired the destruction of the babe and sent two huge serpents to the bed. Alcmena called Amphitryon to her help, but Hercules arose and killed the serpents by strangling them with both his hands" (Bibliotheca 2.4.8)

#### Education and Teachers

Heracles' teachers are listed in detail: "Hercules was taught to drive a chariot by Amphitryon, to wrestle by Autolycus, to shoot with the bow by Eurytus, to fence by Castor, and to play the lyre by Linus."[^apd-herc-teachers] Linus, a brother of Orpheus, was killed by Heracles when the boy, "being struck by him, flew into a rage and slew him" with a blow of the lyre. Heracles was tried for murder but acquitted by citing a law of Rhadamanthys that permitted self-defence against wrongful aggressors.[^apd-herc-linus]

Amphitryon, fearing the boy might kill again, sent him to tend cattle. There "he was nurtured and outdid all in stature and strength. Even by the look of him it was plain that he was a son of Zeus."[^apd-herc-cattle]

[^apd-herc-teachers]: "Hercules was taught to drive a chariot by Amphitryon, to wrestle by Autolycus, to shoot with the bow by Eurytus, to fence by Castor, and to play the lyre by Linus" (Bibliotheca 2.4.9)
[^apd-herc-linus]: "This Linus was a brother of Orpheus; he came to Thebes and became a Theban, but was killed by Hercules with a blow of the lyre; for being struck by him, Hercules flew into a rage and slew him" (Bibliotheca 2.4.9)
[^apd-herc-cattle]: "he was nurtured and outdid all in stature and strength. Even by the look of him it was plain that he was a son of Zeus" (Bibliotheca 2.4.9)

#### The Lion of Cithaeron and Thespius's Daughters

At eighteen, Heracles slew the lion of Cithaeron that harried the cattle of Amphitryon and Thespius. Thespius, king of Thespiae, entertained him for fifty days; "each night, as Hercules went forth to the hunt, Thespius bedded one of his daughters with him (fifty daughters having been borne to him by Megamede, daughter of Arneus); for he was anxious that all of them should have children by Hercules."[^apd-herc-thespius]

[^apd-herc-thespius]: "each night, as Hercules went forth to the hunt, Thespius bedded one of his daughters with him (fifty daughters having been borne to him by Megamede, daughter of Arneus); for he was anxious that all of them should have children by Hercules. Thus Hercules, though he thought that his bed-fellow was always the same, had intercourse with them all" (Bibliotheca 2.4.10)

#### Erginus and the Minyans

Returning from the lion hunt, Heracles met heralds from Erginus demanding tribute from the Thebans. He "cut off their ears and noses and hands, and having fastened them by ropes from their necks, he told them to carry that tribute to Erginus and the Minyans."[^apd-herc-erginus] When Erginus marched against [Thebes](../places/thebes.md), Heracles "having received weapons from [Athena](../deities/athena.md) and taken the command, killed Erginus, put the Minyans to flight, and compelled them to pay double the tribute to the Thebans."[^apd-herc-minyans] Amphitryon fell in this battle. Heracles received Creon's eldest daughter Megara as a prize of valour and had three sons by her: Therimachus, Creontiades, and Deicoon.

[^apd-herc-erginus]: "he cut off their ears and noses and hands, and having fastened them by ropes from their necks, he told them to carry that tribute to Erginus and the Minyans" (Bibliotheca 2.4.11)
[^apd-herc-minyans]: "Hercules, having received weapons from Athena and taken the command, killed Erginus, put the Minyans to flight, and compelled them to pay double the tribute to the Thebans" (Bibliotheca 2.4.11)

#### Madness and the Oracle

"After the battle with the Minyans Hercules was driven mad through the jealousy of Hera and flung his own children, whom he had by Megara, and two children of Iphicles into the fire."[^apd-herc-madness] He condemned himself to exile, was purified by Thespius, and went to [Delphi](../places/delphi.md). "The Pythian priestess then first called him Hercules, for hitherto he was called Alcides."[^apd-herc-name] She told him to dwell in Tiryns, serve Eurystheus for twelve years, perform ten labours, and "when the tasks were accomplished, he would be immortal."

[^apd-herc-madness]: "after the battle with the Minyans Hercules was driven mad through the jealousy of Hera and flung his own children, whom he had by Megara, and two children of Iphicles into the fire" (Bibliotheca 2.4.12)
[^apd-herc-name]: "The Pythian priestess then first called him Hercules, for hitherto he was called Alcides" (Bibliotheca 2.4.12)

### The Twelve Labours

Eurystheus prescribed ten labours, but refused to count two of them (the Hydra, because Iolaus helped, and the Augean Stables, because Heracles did it for hire), making the total twelve. The labours were performed "in eight years and a month."[^apd-herc-duration]

[^apd-herc-duration]: "When the labours had been performed in eight years and a month, Eurystheus ordered Hercules, as an eleventh labour, to fetch golden apples from the Hesperides, for he did not acknowledge the labour of the cattle of Augeas nor that of the hydra" (Bibliotheca 2.5.11)

#### 1. The Nemean Lion

The [Nemean Lion](../creatures/nemean-lion.md) was "an invulnerable beast begotten by Typhon."[^apd-herc-lion1] On the way, Heracles lodged with the day-labourer Molorchus and told him to wait thirty days: if Heracles returned, to sacrifice to Saviour [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md); if not, to sacrifice to Heracles as a hero. Finding the lion invulnerable to arrows, Heracles "heaved up his club and made after him." When the lion fled into a two-mouthed cave, Heracles blocked one entrance, entered the other, "and putting his arm round its neck held it tight till he had choked it."[^apd-herc-lion2] He returned on the thirtieth day. Eurystheus, "amazed at his manhood," forbade him to enter the city and thereafter "sent his commands for the labours through a herald, Copreus." Eurystheus also "had a bronze jar made for himself to hide in under the earth."[^apd-herc-lion3]

[^apd-herc-lion1]: "an invulnerable beast begotten by Typhon" (Bibliotheca 2.5.1)
[^apd-herc-lion2]: "putting his arm round its neck held it tight till he had choked it; so laying it on his shoulders he carried it to Cleonae" (Bibliotheca 2.5.1)
[^apd-herc-lion3]: "Amazed at his manhood, Eurystheus forbade him thenceforth to enter the city, but ordered him to exhibit the fruits of his labours before the gates. They say, too, that in his fear he had a bronze jar made for himself to hide in under the earth, and that he sent his commands for the labours through a herald, Copreus" (Bibliotheca 2.5.1)

#### 2. The Lernaean Hydra

The [Hydra](../creatures/hydra.md) of Lerna "had a huge body, with nine heads, eight mortal, but the middle one immortal."[^apd-herc-hydra1] Heracles drove it out with fiery shafts but could not destroy it by smashing heads, "for as fast as one head was smashed there grew up two." A huge crab also attacked him. Heracles called on Iolaus, who "by setting fire to a piece of the neighboring wood and burning the roots of the heads with the brands, prevented them from sprouting."[^apd-herc-hydra2] Heracles then "chopped off the immortal head, and buried it, and put a heavy rock on it." He dipped his arrows in the hydra's gall. Eurystheus refused to count this labour "because he had not got the better of the hydra by himself, but with the help of Iolaus."[^apd-herc-hydra3]

[^apd-herc-hydra1]: "the hydra had a huge body, with nine heads, eight mortal, but the middle one immortal" (Bibliotheca 2.5.2)
[^apd-herc-hydra2]: "Iolaus who, by setting fire to a piece of the neighboring wood and burning the roots of the heads with the brands, prevented them from sprouting" (Bibliotheca 2.5.2)
[^apd-herc-hydra3]: "Eurystheus said that this labour should not be reckoned among the ten because he had not got the better of the hydra by himself, but with the help of Iolaus" (Bibliotheca 2.5.2)

#### 3. The Cerynitian Hind

The hind "had golden horns and was sacred to [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md)." Heracles "hunted it a whole year" without killing or wounding it. Finally he shot it as it crossed the river Ladon. [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md) with [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) met him and "would have wrested the hind from him, and rebuked him for attempting to kill her sacred animal." But "by pleading necessity and laying the blame on Eurystheus, he appeased the anger of the goddess and carried the beast alive to Mycenae."[^apd-herc-hind]

[^apd-herc-hind]: "Artemis with Apollo met him, and would have wrested the hind from him, and rebuked him for attempting to kill her sacred animal. Howbeit, by pleading necessity and laying the blame on Eurystheus, he appeased the anger of the goddess and carried the beast alive to Mycenae" (Bibliotheca 2.5.3)

#### 4. The Erymanthian Boar and the Centaurs

On the way to capture the Erymanthian boar, Heracles was entertained by the centaur Pholus, who opened a jar of wine belonging to the centaurs in common. The scent drew the other centaurs, who attacked; Heracles repelled them, pursuing them to Malea. There, an arrow meant for the centaurs passed through the arm of Elatus and struck [Chiron](../creatures/chiron.md) in the knee. The wound proved incurable, and though immortal, Chiron "wished to die" — [Prometheus](../deities/prometheus.md) offered to become immortal in his stead, and Chiron died.[^apd-herc-chiron] Pholus also died accidentally, when an arrow slipped from his hand and struck his foot.[^apd-herc-pholus] Heracles then "chased the boar with shouts from a certain thicket, drove the exhausted animal into deep snow, trapped it, and brought it to Mycenae."[^apd-herc-boar]

[^apd-herc-chiron]: "the hurt proving incurable, Chiron retired to the cave and there he wished to die, but he could not, for he was immortal. However, Prometheus offered himself to Zeus to be immortal in his stead, and so Chiron died" (Bibliotheca 2.5.4)
[^apd-herc-pholus]: "Pholus, drawing the arrow from a corpse, wondered that so little a thing could kill such big fellows; howbeit, it slipped from his hand and lighting on his foot killed him on the spot" (Bibliotheca 2.5.4)
[^apd-herc-boar]: "when he had chased the boar with shouts from a certain thicket, he drove the exhausted animal into deep snow, trapped it, and brought it to Mycenae" (Bibliotheca 2.5.4)

#### 5. The Augean Stables

Heracles was ordered to clean out the dung of the cattle of Augeas, king of Elis, in a single day. Without revealing Eurystheus's command, he offered to do it if Augeas would give him a tithe of the cattle. He "made a breach in the foundations of the cattle-yard, and then, diverting the courses of the Alpheus and Peneus, which flowed near each other, he turned them into the yard."[^apd-herc-augeas1] When Augeas learned it was done at Eurystheus's command, he refused to pay. Augeas's own son Phyleus "bore witness against his father, affirming that he had agreed to give him a reward." In a rage, Augeas expelled both Phyleus and Heracles from Elis.[^apd-herc-augeas2] Eurystheus refused to count this labour "alleging that it had been performed for hire."

[^apd-herc-augeas1]: "diverting the courses of the Alpheus and Peneus, which flowed near each other, he turned them into the yard, having first made an outlet for the water through another opening" (Bibliotheca 2.5.5)
[^apd-herc-augeas2]: "Phyleus was called by Hercules and bore witness against his father, affirming that he had agreed to give him a reward. In a rage Augeas, before the voting took place, ordered both Phyleus and Hercules to pack out of Elis" (Bibliotheca 2.5.5)

#### 6. The Stymphalian Birds

At the lake of Stymphalus in Arcadia, countless birds had gathered. [Athena](../deities/athena.md) "gave him brazen castanets, which she had received from [Hephaestus](../deities/hephaestus.md). By clashing these on a certain mountain that overhung the lake, he scared the birds. They could not abide the sound, but fluttered up in a fright, and in that way Hercules shot them."[^apd-herc-birds]

[^apd-herc-birds]: "Athena gave him brazen castanets, which she had received from Hephaestus. By clashing these on a certain mountain that overhung the lake, he scared the birds. They could not abide the sound, but fluttered up in a fright, and in that way Hercules shot them" (Bibliotheca 2.5.6)

#### 7. The Cretan Bull

The seventh labour was to bring the Cretan bull, which some identified as the bull that carried Europa for [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md), and others as the bull [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) sent from the sea when Minos broke his vow. When Minos told Heracles to "fight and catch the bull for himself, he caught it and brought it to Eurystheus, and having shown it to him he let it afterwards go free." The bull eventually roamed to Marathon in Attica.[^apd-herc-bull]

[^apd-herc-bull]: "he caught it and brought it to Eurystheus, and having shown it to him he let it afterwards go free. But the bull roamed to Sparta and all Arcadia, and traversing the Isthmus arrived at Marathon in Attica and harried the inhabitants" (Bibliotheca 2.5.7)

#### 8. The Mares of Diomedes

Diomedes, son of [Ares](../deities/ares.md), king of the warlike Bistones, "owned man-eating mares." Heracles overpowered the grooms and drove the mares to the sea. He entrusted them to Abderus, "a son of [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md), a native of Opus in Locris, and a minion of Hercules; but the mares killed him by dragging him after them."[^apd-herc-mares] Heracles slew Diomedes, routed the Bistones, and "founded a city Abdera beside the grave of Abderus." Eurystheus released the mares, which were destroyed by wild beasts on Mount Olympus.

[^apd-herc-mares]: "Abderus, who was a son of Hermes, a native of Opus in Locris, and a minion of Hercules; but the mares killed him by dragging him after them" (Bibliotheca 2.5.8)

#### 9. The Belt of Hippolyte

Hippolyte, queen of the Amazons, "had the belt of [Ares](../deities/ares.md) in token of her superiority to all the rest."[^apd-herc-belt1] Hippolyte visited Heracles at the harbour of Themiscyra and promised to give him the belt. "But [Hera](../deities/hera.md) in the likeness of an Amazon went up and down the multitude saying that the strangers who had arrived were carrying off the queen." The Amazons charged; Heracles, suspecting treachery, "killing Hippolyte stripped her of her belt."[^apd-herc-belt2]

During the return voyage, Heracles touched at [Troy](../places/troy.md) and found the city afflicted by [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) and [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) (who had fortified Pergamum and been cheated of their wages by Laomedon). Heracles promised to save Hesione from a sea monster in exchange for the mares [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) had given as compensation for Ganymede. He killed the monster and saved Hesione, but Laomedon refused to pay. Heracles "put to sea after threatening to make war on Troy."[^apd-herc-troy1]

[^apd-herc-belt1]: "Hippolyte had the belt of Ares in token of her superiority to all the rest" (Bibliotheca 2.5.9)
[^apd-herc-belt2]: "Hera in the likeness of an Amazon went up and down the multitude saying that the strangers who had arrived were carrying off the queen. So the Amazons in arms charged on horseback down on the ship. But when Hercules saw them in arms, he suspected treachery, and killing Hippolyte stripped her of her belt" (Bibliotheca 2.5.9)
[^apd-herc-troy1]: "Hercules promised to save her on condition of receiving from Laomedon the mares which Zeus had given in compensation for the rape of Ganymede... Hercules killed the monster and saved Hesione. But when Laomedon would not give the stipulated reward, Hercules put to sea after threatening to make war on Troy" (Bibliotheca 2.5.9)

#### 10. The Cattle of Geryon

Geryon of Erythia "had the body of three men grown together and joined in one at the waist, but parted in three from the flanks and thighs."[^apd-herc-geryon1] Journeying west, Heracles "erected as tokens of his journey two pillars over against each other at the boundaries of Europe and Libya." When the Sun heated him on his journey, "he bent his bow at the god, who in admiration of his hardihood, gave him a golden goblet in which he crossed the ocean."[^apd-herc-geryon2] On Erythia he slew the two-headed hound Orthus, the herdsman Eurytion, and Geryon himself. He sailed back in the golden goblet and returned it to the Sun.

The return journey was long and eventful. In Italy, a bull broke free and swam to Sicily, where Eryx mingled it with his herds; Heracles wrestled Eryx three times and killed him. [Hera](../deities/hera.md) afflicted the cattle with a gadfly in Thrace, scattering them. Heracles blamed the river Strymon and "made it unnavigable by filling it with rocks."[^apd-herc-geryon3] He finally delivered the cattle to Eurystheus, who sacrificed them to [Hera](../deities/hera.md).

[^apd-herc-geryon1]: "He had the body of three men grown together and joined in one at the waist, but parted in three from the flanks and thighs" (Bibliotheca 2.5.10)
[^apd-herc-geryon2]: "being heated by the Sun on his journey, he bent his bow at the god, who in admiration of his hardihood, gave him a golden goblet in which he crossed the ocean" (Bibliotheca 2.5.10)
[^apd-herc-geryon3]: "Hercules blamed the river Strymon, and whereas it had been navigable before, he made it unnavigable by filling it with rocks; and he conveyed the kine and gave them to Eurystheus, who sacrificed them to Hera" (Bibliotheca 2.5.10)

#### 11. The Apples of the Hesperides

The golden apples were guarded by "an immortal dragon with a hundred heads, offspring of Typhon and [Echidna](../creatures/echidna.md), which spoke with many and divers sorts of voices."[^apd-herc-hesp1] On the long journey, Heracles encountered and defeated several foes:

- **Antaeus** in Libya, son of [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md): "when he touched earth so it was that he waxed stronger." Heracles "hugged him, lifted him aloft, broke and killed him."[^apd-herc-antaeus]
- **Busiris** in Egypt, who sacrificed strangers on an altar of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md): "Hercules also was seized and haled to the altars, but he burst his bonds and slew both Busiris and his son Amphidamas."[^apd-herc-busiris]
- **[Prometheus](../deities/prometheus.md)** on the Caucasus: Heracles "shot on the Caucasus the eagle, offspring of [Echidna](../creatures/echidna.md) and Typhon, that was devouring the liver of Prometheus, and he released Prometheus."[^apd-herc-prometheus2]

On Prometheus's advice, Heracles sent [Atlas](../deities/atlas.md) to fetch the apples rather than going himself, relieving Atlas of the celestial sphere. When Atlas returned with three apples and refused to take back the sky, Heracles tricked him: "at the advice of Prometheus he begged Atlas to hold up the sky till he should put a pad on his head. When Atlas heard that, he laid the apples down on the ground and took the sphere from Hercules."[^apd-herc-atlas] [Athena](../deities/athena.md) eventually returned the apples to the Hesperides, "for it was not lawful that they should be laid down anywhere."

[^apd-herc-hesp1]: "an immortal dragon with a hundred heads, offspring of Typhon and Echidna, which spoke with many and divers sorts of voices" (Bibliotheca 2.5.11)
[^apd-herc-antaeus]: "Hercules hugged him, lifted him aloft, broke and killed him; for when he touched earth so it was that he waxed stronger, wherefore some said that he was a son of Earth" (Bibliotheca 2.5.11)
[^apd-herc-busiris]: "Hercules also was seized and haled to the altars, but he burst his bonds and slew both Busiris and his son Amphidamas" (Bibliotheca 2.5.11)
[^apd-herc-prometheus2]: "he shot on the Caucasus the eagle, offspring of Echidna and Typhon, that was devouring the liver of Prometheus, and he released Prometheus" (Bibliotheca 2.5.11)
[^apd-herc-atlas]: "at the advice of Prometheus he begged Atlas to hold up the sky till he should put a pad on his head. When Atlas heard that, he laid the apples down on the ground and took the sphere from Hercules. And so Hercules picked up the apples and departed" (Bibliotheca 2.5.11)

#### 12. Cerberus

The final labour was to bring [Cerberus](../creatures/cerberus.md) from [Hades](../deities/hades.md). Cerberus "had three heads of dogs, the tail of a dragon, and on his back the heads of all sorts of snakes."[^apd-herc-cerb1] Before descending, Heracles was initiated into the Eleusinian mysteries by Eumolpus (after being cleansed of the slaughter of the centaurs).

Entering through Taenarum, Heracles encountered the souls of the dead: "when the souls saw him, they fled, save Meleager and the Gorgon Medusa." He drew his sword against the Gorgon but "learned from [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md) that she was an empty phantom."[^apd-herc-cerb2] He found Theseus and Pirithous bound near the gates; "Theseus, indeed, he took by the hand and raised up, but when he would have brought up Pirithous, the earth quaked and he let go."[^apd-herc-cerb3]

He wrestled the herdsman Menoetes, breaking his ribs, but released him at [Persephone](../deities/persephone.md)'s request. "[Hades](../deities/hades.md) ordered him to take the animal provided he mastered him without the use of the weapons which he carried." Heracles, "cased in his cuirass and covered by the lion's skin, flung his arms round the head of the brute, and though the dragon in its tail bit him, he never relaxed his grip and pressure till it yielded."[^apd-herc-cerb4] He carried Cerberus up through Troezen, showed it to Eurystheus, and returned it to Hades.

[^apd-herc-cerb1]: "this Cerberus had three heads of dogs, the tail of a dragon, and on his back the heads of all sorts of snakes" (Bibliotheca 2.5.12)
[^apd-herc-cerb2]: "when the souls saw him, they fled, save Meleager and the Gorgon Medusa. And Hercules drew his sword against the Gorgon, as if she were alive, but he learned from Hermes that she was an empty phantom" (Bibliotheca 2.5.12)
[^apd-herc-cerb3]: "Theseus, indeed, he took by the hand and raised up, but when he would have brought up Pirithous, the earth quaked and he let go" (Bibliotheca 2.5.12)
[^apd-herc-cerb4]: "Hades ordered him to take the animal provided he mastered him without the use of the weapons which he carried. Hercules found him at the gates of Acheron, and, cased in his cuirass and covered by the lion's skin, he flung his arms round the head of the brute, and though the dragon in its tail bit him, he never relaxed his grip and pressure till it yielded" (Bibliotheca 2.5.12)

### Later Adventures

#### Eurytus and Iole

After the labours, Heracles sought to marry Iole, daughter of Eurytus of Oechalia. He "proved himself better than them at archery," but Eurytus refused, fearing "that, if he got children, he would again kill his offspring."[^apd-herc-eurytus]

[^apd-herc-eurytus]: "though he proved himself better than them at archery, yet he did not get the bride; for while Iphitus, the elder of Eurytus's sons, said that Iole should be given to Hercules, Eurytus and the others refused, and said they feared that, if he got children, he would again kill his offspring" (Bibliotheca 2.6.1)

#### Murder of Iphitus

When cattle were stolen from Euboea, Eurytus blamed Heracles; but Iphitus, trusting Heracles, invited him to search for the cattle together. "Hercules promised to do so and entertained him; but going mad again he threw him from the walls of Tiryns."[^apd-herc-iphitus2] Seeking purification, Heracles was refused by Neleus of Pylos and eventually purified by Deiphobus at Amyclae. Afflicted by disease for the murder, he went to [Delphi](../places/delphi.md), and when the priestess would not answer, "he was fain to plunder the temple, and, carrying off the tripod, to institute an oracle of his own. But [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) fought him, and [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) threw a thunderbolt between them."[^apd-herc-tripod] The oracle declared he must be sold into slavery for three years.

[^apd-herc-iphitus2]: "going mad again he threw him from the walls of Tiryns" (Bibliotheca 2.6.2)
[^apd-herc-tripod]: "he was fain to plunder the temple, and, carrying off the tripod, to institute an oracle of his own. But Apollo fought him, and Zeus threw a thunderbolt between them" (Bibliotheca 2.6.2)

#### Servitude to Omphale

[Hermes](../deities/hermes.md) sold Heracles to Omphale, queen of Lydia. During his servitude he captured the Cercopes at Ephesus, killed Syleus who forced strangers to dig, and buried the body of Icarus on the island thereafter called Icaria. "During the time of his servitude with Omphale it is said that the voyage to Colchis and the hunt of the Calydonian boar took place."[^apd-herc-omphale]

[^apd-herc-omphale]: "during the time of his servitude with Omphale it is said that the voyage to Colchis and the hunt of the Calydonian boar took place, and that Theseus on his way from Troezen cleared the Isthmus of malefactors" (Bibliotheca 2.6.3)

#### The Sack of Troy

After his servitude, Heracles mustered an army and "sailed for Ilium with eighteen ships of fifty oars each."[^apd-herc-troy2] Laomedon killed Oicles in a sortie against the ships, but was driven back. "Telamon was the first to breach the wall and enter the city, and after him Hercules." Heracles nearly killed Telamon in jealous rage, but Telamon saved himself by saying he was building an altar to "Hercules the Glorious Victor."[^apd-herc-telamon]

Heracles shot Laomedon and his sons (except Podarces) and gave Hesione to Telamon. When she ransomed her brother Podarces with her veil, "hence Podarces was called Priam."[^apd-herc-priam]

[^apd-herc-troy2]: "he mustered an army of noble volunteers and sailed for Ilium with eighteen ships of fifty oars each" (Bibliotheca 2.6.4)
[^apd-herc-telamon]: "Telamon was the first to breach the wall and enter the city, and after him Hercules. But when he saw that Telamon had entered it first, he drew his sword and rushed at him... Telamon collected stones that lay to hand, and when Hercules asked him what he did, he said he was building an altar to Hercules the Glorious Victor" (Bibliotheca 2.6.4)
[^apd-herc-priam]: "when she chose her brother Podarces, Hercules said that he must first be a slave and then be ransomed by her. So when he was being sold she took the veil from her head and gave it as a ransom; hence Podarces was called Priam" (Bibliotheca 2.6.4)

### Wars and Later Campaigns

#### War on Augeas

When [Hera](../deities/hera.md) sent storms against Heracles as he sailed from [Troy](../places/troy.md), [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) punished her by hanging her from [Olympus](../places/olympus.md).[^apd-herc-hera-storms] Heracles landed on Cos, fought the inhabitants, slew King Eurypylus, and then came through [Athena](../deities/athena.md)'s agency to Phlegra to fight alongside the gods in the [Gigantomachy](../creatures/giants.md).

He later collected an army against Augeas, appointing Eurytus and Cteatus (the Molionides, "two men joined in one") as generals.[^apd-herc-molionides] Heracles fell ill and was forced to retreat, but later ambushed and killed the Molionides at Cleonae during the Isthmian festival. He took Elis, killed Augeas, restored Phyleus, and "celebrated the Olympian games and founded an altar of Pelops."[^apd-herc-olympia]

[^apd-herc-hera-storms]: "When Hercules was sailing from Troy, Hera sent grievous storms, which so vexed Zeus that he hung her from Olympus" (Bibliotheca 2.7.1)
[^apd-herc-molionides]: "Eurytus and Cteatus... were two men joined in one, who surpassed all of that generation in strength" (Bibliotheca 2.7.2)
[^apd-herc-olympia]: "He also celebrated the Olympian games and founded an altar of Pelops, and built six altars of the twelve gods" (Bibliotheca 2.7.2)

#### War on Pylos

Heracles took Pylos and "slew Periclymenus, the most valiant of the sons of Neleus, who used to change his shape in battle." He killed Neleus and all his sons "except Nestor; for he was a youth and was being brought up among the Gerenians." Remarkably, "in the fight he also wounded [Hades](../deities/hades.md), who was siding with the Pylians."[^apd-herc-pylos]

[^apd-herc-pylos]: "having taken the city he slew Periclymenus, the most valiant of the sons of Neleus, who used to change his shape in battle. And he slew Neleus and his sons, except Nestor; for he was a youth and was being brought up among the Gerenians. In the fight he also wounded Hades, who was siding with the Pylians" (Bibliotheca 2.7.3)

#### War on Lacedaemon

Heracles marched against the sons of Hippocoon in Lacedaemon, who had killed the son of Licymnius. He persuaded Cepheus of Tegea to join with his twenty sons by giving his daughter Sterope a lock of the Gorgon's hair in a bronze jar (a gift from [Athena](../deities/athena.md)): if held up from the walls three times, it would turn enemies to flight.[^apd-herc-gorgon-hair] In the battle, Cepheus and his sons perished, as did Iphicles, Heracles' brother. Heracles killed Hippocoon and his sons, "subjugated the city," and "restored Tyndareus and entrusted the kingdom to him."[^apd-herc-lacedaemon]

[^apd-herc-gorgon-hair]: "Hercules had received from Athena a lock of the Gorgon's hair in a bronze jar and gave it to Sterope, daughter of Cepheus, saying that if an army advanced against the city, she was to hold up the lock of hair thrice from the walls, and that, provided she did not look before her, the enemy would be turned to flight" (Bibliotheca 2.7.3)
[^apd-herc-lacedaemon]: "Having killed Hippocoon and his sons and subjugated the city, Hercules restored Tyndareus and entrusted the kingdom to him" (Bibliotheca 2.7.3)

#### Auge and Telephus

Passing through Tegea, Heracles unknowingly seduced Auge, daughter of Aleus. She bore a son secretly and deposited it in the precinct of [Athena](../deities/athena.md). When a pestilence followed, Aleus discovered the child and exposed it on Mount Parthenius, "and by the providence of the gods it was preserved: for a doe that had just cast her fawn gave it suck, and shepherds took up the babe and called it Telephus."[^apd-herc-telephus]

[^apd-herc-telephus]: "by the providence of the gods it was preserved: for a doe that had just cast her fawn gave it suck, and shepherds took up the babe and called it Telephus" (Bibliotheca 2.7.4)

### Death and Apotheosis

#### Wooing Deianira and Wrestling Achelous

At Calydon, Heracles "wooed [Deianira](deianira.md), daughter of Oeneus. He wrestled for her hand with Achelous, who assumed the likeness of a bull; but Hercules broke off one of his horns."[^apd-herc-achelous] Achelous recovered the horn by exchanging it for the horn of Amalthea, which "had the power of supplying meat or drink in abundance, whatever one might wish."

[^apd-herc-achelous]: "Hercules wooed Deianira, daughter of Oeneus. He wrestled for her hand with Achelous, who assumed the likeness of a bull; but Hercules broke off one of his horns" (Bibliotheca 2.7.5)

#### Nessus and the Poisoned Shirt

While travelling with [Deianira](deianira.md), Heracles came to the river Evenus, where the centaur Nessus "sat and ferried passengers across for hire." Heracles crossed by himself but entrusted Deianira to Nessus, who "in ferrying her across, attempted to violate her. She cried out, Hercules heard her, and shot Nessus to the heart when he emerged from the river."[^apd-herc-nessus] Dying, Nessus told Deianira to mix his spilt seed with the blood from his wound as a love charm; she kept this mixture.

[^apd-herc-nessus]: "he, in ferrying her across, attempted to violate her. She cried out, Hercules heard her, and shot Nessus to the heart when he emerged from the river" (Bibliotheca 2.7.6)

#### Later Campaigns Before Death

At Trachis, Heracles conquered the Dryopes, aided Aegimius the Dorian king against the Lapiths (slaying their leader Coronus), and killed King Laogoras "as he was banqueting in a precinct of [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md)." He also slew Cycnus (a son of [Ares](../deities/ares.md)), and King Amyntor who blocked his passage at Ormenium.[^apd-herc-later-campaigns]

Finally, he mustered an army against Oechalia to punish Eurytus for refusing Iole. He "slew Eurytus and his sons and took the city" and "led Iole captive."[^apd-herc-oechalia]

[^apd-herc-later-campaigns]: "He slew also Laogoras, king of the Dryopes, with his children, as he was banqueting in a precinct of Apollo; for the king was a wanton fellow and an ally of the Lapiths" (Bibliotheca 2.7.7)
[^apd-herc-oechalia]: "he slew Eurytus and his sons and took the city. After burying those of his own side who had fallen... he pillaged the city and led Iole captive" (Bibliotheca 2.7.7)

#### The Shirt of Nessus and Death on Mount Oeta

Building an altar of Cenaean [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) on Euboea, Heracles sent the herald Lichas for fine raiment. [Deianira](deianira.md), learning of Iole and fearing Heracles might love the girl more, "supposed that the spilt blood of Nessus was in truth a love-charm, and with it she smeared the tunic."[^apd-herc-shirt1] When Heracles put it on, "no sooner was the tunic warmed than the poison of the hydra began to corrode his skin." He "lifted Lichas by the feet, hurled him down from the headland, and tore off the tunic, which clung to his body, so that his flesh was torn away with it."[^apd-herc-shirt2] Deianira hanged herself on learning what she had done.

[^apd-herc-shirt1]: "Deianira learned about Iole, and fearing that Hercules might love that damsel more than herself, she supposed that the spilt blood of Nessus was in truth a love-charm, and with it she smeared the tunic" (Bibliotheca 2.7.7)
[^apd-herc-shirt2]: "no sooner was the tunic warmed than the poison of the hydra began to corrode his skin; and on that he lifted Lichas by the feet, hurled him down from the headland, and tore off the tunic, which clung to his body, so that his flesh was torn away with it" (Bibliotheca 2.7.7)

#### Immolation and Apotheosis

Heracles charged his eldest son Hyllus to marry Iole when he came of age. He then "proceeded to Mount Oeta, in the Trachinian territory, and there constructed a pyre, mounted it, and gave orders to kindle it. When no one would do so, Poeas, passing by to look for his flocks, set a light to it. On him Hercules bestowed his bow."[^apd-herc-pyre] "While the pyre was burning, it is said that a cloud passed under Hercules and with a peal of thunder wafted him up to heaven. Thereafter he obtained immortality, and being reconciled to [Hera](../deities/hera.md) he married her daughter [Hebe](../deities/hebe.md), by whom he had sons, Alexiares and Anicetus."[^apd-herc-apotheosis2]

[^apd-herc-pyre]: "he proceeded to Mount Oeta, in the Trachinian territory, and there constructed a pyre, mounted it, and gave orders to kindle it. When no one would do so, Poeas, passing by to look for his flocks, set a light to it. On him Hercules bestowed his bow" (Bibliotheca 2.7.7)
[^apd-herc-apotheosis2]: "while the pyre was burning, it is said that a cloud passed under Hercules and with a peal of thunder wafted him up to heaven. Thereafter he obtained immortality, and being reconciled to Hera he married her daughter Hebe, by whom he had sons, Alexiares and Anicetus" (Bibliotheca 2.7.7)

### The Heraclids

After Heracles' apotheosis, his sons fled Eurystheus and eventually took refuge in Athens, sitting on the altar of Mercy. The Athenians defended them and "slew his sons, Alexander, Iphimedon, Eurybius, Mentor and Perimedes. Eurystheus himself fled in a chariot, but was pursued and slain by Hyllus just as he was driving past the Scironian cliffs."[^apd-herc-eurystheus-death] Alcmena "gouged out his eyes with weaving-pins."

The Heraclids initially captured all the cities of the Peloponnese, but a plague drove them out within a year; an oracle declared they had returned before the proper time. Hyllus married Iole as his father had commanded and consulted [Delphi](../places/delphi.md) about when to return. The god said to "await the third crop" — Hyllus took this to mean three years, but it meant three generations.[^apd-herc-third-crop] The Heraclids' final successful return came under Temenus, Cresphontes, and the sons of Aristodemus. They divided the Peloponnese by lot: Temenus received Argos, the sons of Aristodemus received Lacedaemon, and Cresphontes (by a trick with a clod of earth dissolved in water) obtained Messene.[^apd-herc-lots]

[^apd-herc-eurystheus-death]: "the Athenians bore the brunt of war with Eurystheus, and slew his sons, Alexander, Iphimedon, Eurybius, Mentor and Perimedes. Eurystheus himself fled in a chariot, but was pursued and slain by Hyllus just as he was driving past the Scironian cliffs; and Hyllus cut off his head and gave it to Alcmena; and she gouged out his eyes with weaving-pins" (Bibliotheca 2.8.1)
[^apd-herc-third-crop]: "the god said that they should await the third crop before returning. But Hyllus supposed that the third crop signified three years... the god retorted that they were themselves to blame for their misfortunes, for they did not understand the oracles, seeing that by 'the third crop' he meant, not a crop of the earth, but a crop of a generation" (Bibliotheca 2.8.2)
[^apd-herc-lots]: "the first drawing was for Argos, the second for Lacedaemon, and the third for Messene... Cresphontes, wishing to have Messene allotted to him, threw in a clod of earth. As the clod was dissolved in the water, it could not be but that the other two lots should turn up" (Bibliotheca 2.8.4)

## In the Fabulae

### Birth and Divine Conception (§29)

The [Fabulae](../sources/hyginus.md) preserves a distinctive account of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md)'s night with Alcmena. When Amphitryon was away subduing Oichalia, "Alcimena, thinking Jove was her husband, received him in her chamber. When he had entered her room, and told her what he had done in Oichalia, she lay with him, thinking he was her husband."[^hyg-29-conception] [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) prolonged the night itself: "He lay with her with so much pleasure that he spent one day and doubled two nights, so that Alcimena wondered at such a long night."[^hyg-29-night]

When Amphitryon returned and Alcmena showed no surprise, "he began to wonder and to complain that she did not welcome him when he appeared. Alcimena replied: You already came and lay with me, and told me what you had done in Oichalia."[^hyg-29-return] Amphitryon realized "that some divinity had assumed his form, and from that day did not lie with her. But she, from the embrace of Jove, bore Hercules."[^hyg-29-birth]

[^hyg-29-conception]: "Alcimena, thinking Jove was her husband, received him in her chamber. When he had entered her room, and told her what he had done in Oichalia, she lay with him, thinking he was her husband" (Fabulae §29, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-29-night]: "He lay with her with so much pleasure that he spent one day and doubled two nights, so that Alcimena wondered at such a long night" (Fabulae §29, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-29-return]: "Alcimena replied: You already came and lay with me, and told me what you had done in Oichalia. When she had given him all the evidence, Amphitryon realized that some divinity had assumed his form" (Fabulae §29, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-29-birth]: "from that day did not lie with her. But she, from the embrace of Jove, bore Hercules" (Fabulae §29, trans. Mary Grant)

### The Twelve Labours (§30)

Hyginus provides a compressed catalogue of Heracles' twelve labours with unique variants. As an infant, "he strangled with his two hands the two snakes which Juno had sent — whence his name, Primigenius."[^hyg-30-infant] The labours themselves include several distinctive details:

- The Nemean Lion was "an invulnerable monster, which Luna had nourished in a two-mouthed cave."[^hyg-30-lion]
- The Hydra "was so poisonous that she killed men with her breath, and if anyone passed by when she was sleeping, he breathed her tracks and died in the greatest torment."[^hyg-30-hydra] Heracles "dipped his arrows in her gall; and so whatever later he hit with his arrows did not escape death, and later he himself perished in Phrygia from the same cause."[^hyg-30-poison]
- The Augean Stables: "He cleaned in one day the ox dung of King Augeas, Jove helping him for the most part. By letting in a river he washed away all the dung."[^hyg-30-augeas]
- Diomedes' horses were named "Podargus, Lampon, Xanthus, and Dinus," and Heracles "killed [Diomedes] along with the slave Abderus."[^hyg-30-diomedes]
- Hippolyte: Heracles "slew Hippolyte, daughter of Mars and Queen Otrera, and took from her the belt of the Amazon Queen; then he presented Antiopa as captive to Theseus."[^hyg-30-hippolyte]

[^hyg-30-infant]: "When he was an infant, he strangled with his two hands the two snakes which Juno had sent — whence his name, Primigenius" (Fabulae §30, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-30-lion]: "The Nemean Lion, an invulnerable monster, which Luna had nourished in a two-mouthed cave, he slew and took the pelt for defensive covering" (Fabulae §30, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-30-hydra]: "The nine-headed Lernaean Hydra, offspring of Typhon. This monster was so poisonous that she killed men with her breath, and if anyone passed by when she was sleeping, he breathed her tracks and died in the greatest torment" (Fabulae §30, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-30-poison]: "dipped his arrows in her gall; and so whatever later he hit with his arrows did not escape death, and later he himself perished in Phrygia from the same cause" (Fabulae §30, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-30-augeas]: "He cleaned in one day the ox dung of King Augeas, Jove helping him for the most part. By letting in a river he washed away all the dung" (Fabulae §30, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-30-diomedes]: "Diomedes, King of Thrace, and his four horses which fed on human flesh he killed along with the slave Abderus. The horses' names were Podargus, Lampon, Xanthus, and Dinus" (Fabulae §30, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-30-hippolyte]: "Hippolyte, daughter of Mars and Queen Otrera, and took from her the belt of the Amazon Queen; then he presented Antiopa as captive to Theseus" (Fabulae §30, trans. Mary Grant)

### The Madness and Death of Megara (§32)

After Heracles returned from fetching Cerberus, "Lycus, son of Neptune... planned to kill his wife Megara, daughter of Creon, and his sons, Therimachus and Ophites, and seize the kingdom. Hercules prevented him and killed Lycus."[^hyg-32-lycus] Then [Hera](../deities/hera.md) sent madness: "when madness was sent upon him by Juno, he killed Megara and his sons Therimachus and Ophites."[^hyg-32-madness]

Seeking purification, "he begged [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) to give him an oracular reply on how to expiate his crime. Because Apollo was unwilling, Hercules wrathfully carried off the tripod from his shrine."[^hyg-32-tripod] This is the same quarrel mentioned in the [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md), but Hyginus specifies the servitude's cause: "at the command of Jove, he returned it, and bade him give the reply, though unwilling. Hercules because of this offence was given in servitude to Queen Omphale by Mercury."[^hyg-32-omphale]

[^hyg-32-lycus]: "Lycus, son of Neptune, though he had perished, he planned to kill his wife Megara, daughter of Creon, and his sons, Therimachus and Ophites, and seize the kingdom. Hercules prevented him and killed Lycus" (Fabulae §32, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-32-madness]: "when madness was sent upon him by Juno, he killed Megara and his sons Therimachus and Ophites" (Fabulae §32, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-32-tripod]: "he begged Apollo to give him an oracular reply on how to expiate his crime. Because Apollo was unwilling, Hercules wrathfully carried off the tripod from his shrine" (Fabulae §32, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-32-omphale]: "at the command of Jove, he returned it, and bade him give the reply, though unwilling. Hercules because of this offence was given in servitude to Queen Omphale by Mercury" (Fabulae §32, trans. Mary Grant)

### The Centaurs and Deianira (§33)

When Heracles "had violated" Deianira and "promising he would marry her, Eurytion a centaur, son of Ixion and Nubes, after his departure sought Dejanira as a wife. Her father, fearing violence, promised her to him."[^hyg-33-betrothal] On the wedding day Eurytion came "with his brothers to the wedding. Hercules intervened, and killed the Centaur, and led home his betrothed."[^hyg-33-rescue]

[^hyg-33-betrothal]: "Eurytion a centaur, son of Ixion and Nubes, after his departure sought Dejanira as a wife. Her father, fearing violence, promised her to him" (Fabulae §33, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-33-rescue]: "On the appointed day he came with his brothers to the wedding. Hercules intervened, and killed the Centaur, and led home his betrothed" (Fabulae §33, trans. Mary Grant)

### Nessus and the Poisoned Blood (§34)

At the river Evenus, "Nessus, son of Ixion and Nubes, a centaur, was asked by Dejanira to carry her across the river... but as he was carrying her, in the very river he tried to ravish her. When Hercules came there, and Dejanira implored his aid, he pierced Nessus with his arrows."[^hyg-34-nessus]

The centaur's dying treachery is explicit: "As he died, Nessus, knowing how poisonous the arrows were, since they had been dipped in the gall of the Lernaean Hydra, drew out some of his blood and gave it to Dejanira, telling her it was a love-charm. If she wanted her husband not to desert her, she should have his garments smeared with this blood. Dejanira, believing him, kept it carefully preserved."[^hyg-34-blood]

[^hyg-34-nessus]: "Nessus, son of Ixion and Nubes, a centaur, was asked by Dejanira to carry her across the river Evenus, but as he was carrying her, in the very river he tried to ravish her. When Hercules came there, and Dejanira implored his aid, he pierced Nessus with his arrows" (Fabulae §34, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-34-blood]: "As he died, Nessus, knowing how poisonous the arrows were, since they had been dipped in the gall of the Lernaean Hydra, drew out some of his blood and gave it to Dejanira, telling her it was a love-charm. If she wanted her husband not to desert her, she should have his garments smeared with this blood. Dejanira, believing him, kept it carefully preserved" (Fabulae §34, trans. Mary Grant)

### Iole and the Sack of Oechalia (§35)

Heracles' assault on Oechalia was brutal. After being refused Iole's hand, he "attacked Oichalia. In order to bend the girl to his will, he threatened to kill her relatives in her presence. She, with resolute mind, suffered them to be slain before her eyes. When he had killed them all, he sent Iole as captive before him to Dejanira."[^hyg-35-iole]

> **NEW DETAIL:** Hyginus alone emphasizes Iole's steadfastness — she refused to yield even as her family was slaughtered before her.

[^hyg-35-iole]: "In order to bend the girl to his will, he threatened to kill her relatives in her presence. She, with resolute mind, suffered them to be slain before her eyes. When he had killed them all, he sent Iole as captive before him to Dejanira" (Fabulae §35, trans. Mary Grant)

### Death by the Poisoned Robe (§36)

When Iole arrived, Deianira "feared that she would steal her marriage. So mindful of the instructions of Nessus, she sent a servant named Lichas to take to Hercules a robe dipped in the blood of the centaur."[^hyg-36-robe] Deianira discovered the truth when "a little of it fell to the earth, and when the sun touched it, it began to burn."[^hyg-36-test]

Heracles' death is vividly told: "when he leaped into a stream to put out the blaze, still greater flames burst forth; when he tried to take off the garment the flesh came with it. Then Hercules, whirling Lichas, who had brought the garment, round and round, threw him into the sea, and at the place where he fell a rock appeared which is called Lichas."[^hyg-36-death]

"Philoctetes, son of Poeas, is said to have built a pyre for Hercules on Mount Oita, and he mounted it... For this service he gave Philoctetes his bow and arrows. But Dejanira, because of what had happened to Hercules, killed herself."[^hyg-36-pyre]

[^hyg-36-robe]: "feared that she would steal her marriage. So mindful of the instructions of Nessus, she sent a servant named Lichas to take to Hercules a robe dipped in the blood of the centaur" (Fabulae §36, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-36-test]: "A little of it fell to the earth, and when the sun touched it, it began to burn. When Dejanira saw this, she knew that Nessus had spoken falsely" (Fabulae §36, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-36-death]: "when he leaped into a stream to put out the blaze, still greater flames burst forth; when he tried to take off the garment the flesh came with it. Then Hercules, whirling Lichas, who had brought the garment, round and round, threw him into the sea, and at the place where he fell a rock appeared which is called Lichas" (Fabulae §36, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-36-pyre]: "Philoctetes, son of Poeas, is said to have built a pyre for Hercules on Mount Oita, and he mounted it... For this service he gave Philoctetes his bow and arrows. But Dejanira, because of what had happened to Hercules, killed herself" (Fabulae §36, trans. Mary Grant)

### Incidental Labours (§31)

Hyginus catalogues additional exploits beyond the canonical twelve. Notable variants include:

- **Neleus and sons**: "He killed Neleus and his ten sons for refusing to cleanse him or purify him at the time when he had killed his wife Megara, daughter of Creon, and his sons Therimachus and Ophites."[^hyg-31-neleus] This places Neleus's death after Heracles' madness, not before it as in the [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md).
- **Nessus**: "He killed the centaur Nessus because he tried to violate Dejanira."[^hyg-31-nessus-simple]
- **Achelous**: "The River Achelous used to change himself into all sorts of shapes. When he fought with Hercules to win Dejanira in marriage, he changed himself into a bull. Hercules tore of his horn, presenting it to the Hesperides or the Nymphs, and the goddesses filled it with fruits and called it Cornucopia."[^hyg-31-achelous]

[^hyg-31-neleus]: "He killed Neleus and his ten sons for refusing to cleanse him or purify him at the time when he had killed his wife Megara, daughter of Creon, and his sons Therimachus and Ophites" (Fabulae §31, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-31-nessus-simple]: "He killed the centaur Nessus because he tried to violate Dejanira" (Fabulae §31, trans. Mary Grant)

Hercules tore of his horn, presenting it to the Hesperides or the Nymphs, and the goddesses filled it with fruits and called it Cornucopia" (Fabulae §31, trans. Mary Grant)

## In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md)

### Wrestling Achelous (9.1-88)

Ovid has the river god Achelous narrate his defeat by Heracles in the contest for [Deianira](deianira.md). The two fought like bulls: "so, have I seen two strong bulls rush in combat for the good of some smooth heifer in the pasture."[^met-her-bulls] Heracles boasted that strangling snakes "was the pastime of my cradle days" when Achelous shifted to serpent form. When Achelous became a bull, Heracles tore off his horn, which the Naiads filled with fruit — the origin of the Cornucopia.[^met-her-horn]

### Nessus and the Poisoned Robe (9.98-133)

The centaur Nessus offered to carry Deianira across the swollen river Evenus while Heracles swam. When Nessus tried to ravish her, Heracles shot him from the far bank. Dying, Nessus "gave his tunic, soaked with blood to Deianira as a gift; and said, 'Keep this to strengthen waning love.'"[^met-her-nessus]

### The Death of Heracles (9.134-272)

Years later, when rumor declared Heracles burned with love for Iole, Deianira sent him Nessus's tunic. Heracles put it on while sacrificing at Cenaeum, and the hydra-poisoned garment melted into his flesh. Ovid describes the agony in unflinching detail: "The poisoned garment, cleaving to him, ripped his skin, heat-shriveled, from his burning flesh. Or, tightening on him, as his great strength pulled, stripped with it the great muscles from his limbs, leaving his huge bones bare."[^met-her-agony]

In his fury, Heracles hurled the messenger Lichas into the Euboic Sea, where terror petrified him to rock mid-flight. Then Heracles catalogued his labours — Busiris, Antaeus, Cerberus, the Nemean lion, the Hydra, the horses of Thrace, the sky itself — crying: "Still Eurystheus is alive and well! And there are those who yet believe in Gods!"[^met-her-lament]

### The Pyre and Apotheosis (9.229-272)

Heracles built his pyre on Mount Oeta, spread the Nemean lion skin on top, and "club for pillow, you lay down to sleep, as placid as if... reclining on a banquet-couch."[^met-her-pyre] [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) reassured the frightened gods: "Hercules who conquered everything, shall conquer equally the spreading fires." The mortal part was burned away by [Hephaestus](../deities/hephaestus.md), and like a serpent shedding its skin, "his own celestial, wonderful appeared, majestic and of godlike dignity." Zeus took him up "in the great chariot drawn by four swift steeds" and set him "amid the glittering stars."[^met-her-apotheosis]

[^met-her-bulls]: "so, have I seen two strong bulls rush in combat for the good of some smooth heifer in the pasture—while the herd a-tremble and uncertain, wait; ready to give allegiance to the one most worthy of dominion" (Metamorphoses 9.45-49, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-her-horn]: "he laid his fierce right hand on my tough horn, and broke and tore it from my mutilated head.—This horn, now heaped with fruits delicious and sweet-smelling flowers, the Naiads have held sacred" (Metamorphoses 9.85-89, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-her-nessus]: "he gave his tunic, soaked with blood to Deianira as a gift; and said, 'Keep this to strengthen waning love'" (Metamorphoses 9.131-133, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-her-agony]: "The poisoned garment, cleaving to him, ripped his skin, heat-shriveled, from his burning flesh. Or, tightening on him, as his great strength pulled, stripped with it the great muscles from his limbs, leaving his huge bones bare" (Metamorphoses 9.166-170, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-her-lament]: "But still Eurystheus is alive and well! And there are those who yet believe in Gods!" (Metamorphoses 9.203-204, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-her-pyre]: "club for pillow, you lay down to sleep, as placid as if, with abounding cups of generous wine and crowned with garlands, you were safe, reclining on a banquet-couch" (Metamorphoses 9.233-238, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-her-apotheosis]: "his own celestial, wonderful appeared, majestic and of godlike dignity. And him, the glorious father of the Gods in the great chariot drawn by four swift steeds, took up above the wide-encircling clouds, and set him there amid the glittering stars" (Metamorphoses 9.264-272, trans. Brookes More)

## In [Pindar](../sources/pindar.md)

### The Infant Serpent-Strangler (Nemean I)

Pindar gives the most dramatic retelling of baby Heracles killing the snakes sent by [Hera](../deities/hera.md). The queen of gods, "in the kindling of her anger sent presently the two snakes, and they when the doors were opened went right on into the wide bedchamber, hasting to entwine the children, that they should be a prey to their fierce teeth."[^pin-nem1-snakes]

The infant's response was extraordinary: "the boy lifted up his head upright and was first to essay the fight, seizing with inevitable grasp of both his hands the two serpents by the necks, and time, as he strangled them, forced the breath out of their monstrous forms."[^pin-nem1-strangle]

[Alcmena](../heroes/alcmena.md) "started to her feet from the couch half-robed, and would fain have beaten back the fierce beasts' violence." Then "quickly ran thronging thither with bronze arms the captains of the sons of Kadmos; and brandishing in his hand his sword bare of its sheath came Amphitryon smitten with sharp pain."[^pin-nem1-alarm]

Amphitryon summoned the prophet [Teiresias](../heroes/teiresias.md), who foretold the child's destiny: how many "lawless monsters on the dry land, how many on the sea he should destroy," and "men the hatefullest, who walked in guile and insolence, he prophesied that he should deliver over unto death." At Phlegra's plain "the gods should meet the giants in battle, beneath the rush of his arrows their bright hair should be soiled with earth." As for his ultimate reward, Teiresias prophesied that "in peace himself should obtain a reward of rest from his great toils throughout all time continually within the house of bliss, and after that he had received fair Hebe to be his bride, and made his marriage-feast, should remain beside Zeus, the son of Kronos, well-pleased with his dwelling-place divine."[^pin-nem1-prophecy]

[^pin-nem1-snakes]: "in the kindling of her anger sent presently the two snakes, and they when the doors were opened went right on into the wide bedchamber, hasting to entwine the children, that they should be a prey to their fierce teeth" (Pindar, Nemean I, trans. Ernest Myers)

[^pin-nem1-alarm]: "herself too started to her feet from the couch half-robed, and would fain have beaten back the fierce beasts' violence. And quickly ran thronging thither with bronze arms the captains of the sons of Kadmos; and brandishing in his hand his sword bare of its sheath came Amphitryon" (Pindar, Nemean I)
[^pin-nem1-prophecy]: "in peace himself should obtain a reward of rest from his great toils throughout all time continually within the house of bliss, and after that he had received fair Hebe to be his bride, and made his marriage-feast, should remain beside Zeus, the son of Kronos, well-pleased with his dwelling-place divine" (Pindar, Nemean I)

### Vs. Antaios (Isthmian III)

In Isthmian III, Pindar presents Heracles' wrestling of the giant Antaios as an act of civilising heroism: "unto the house of Antaios came a man to wrestle against him, of short stature but of unbending soul, from Kadmean Thebes even unto corn-bearing Libya, that he might cause him to cease from roofing Poseidon's temple with the skulls of strangers."[^pin-ist3-antaios]

The ode then describes his completed labours and his final glory: "he who ascended up to Olympus, after that he had searched out the surface of the whole earth and of the crag-walled hoary sea, and had made safe way for the sailing of ships." Now "beside the aegis-bearer he dwelleth, possessing happiness most fair, and hath honour from the immortals as their friend, and hath Hebe to wife, and is lord of a golden house, and husband of Hera's child."[^pin-ist3-olympus]

[^pin-ist3-antaios]: "unto the house of Antaios came a man to wrestle against him, of short stature but of unbending soul, from Kadmean Thebes even unto corn-bearing Libya, that he might cause him to cease from roofing Poseidon's temple with the skulls of strangers" (Pindar, Isthmian III, trans. Ernest Myers)
[^pin-ist3-olympus]: "he who ascended up to Olympus, after that he had searched out the surface of the whole earth and of the crag-walled hoary sea, and had made safe way for the sailing of ships. And now beside the aegis-bearer he dwelleth, possessing happiness most fair, and hath honour from the immortals as their friend, and hath Hebe to wife, and is lord of a golden house, and husband of Hera's child" (Pindar, Isthmian III)

### Praying for Ajax's Birth (Isthmian V)

Pindar relates the origin of [Ajax](ajax.md)'s name through a scene in which Heracles prays for Telamon's child. When Heracles came to call Telamon to his voyage, he found the company feasting. "As he stood there in his lion's skin, then did Telamon their chief challenge Amphitryon's son of the mighty spear to make initiative libation of nectar."[^pin-ist5-lion]

Heracles prayed to Zeus: "If ever, O father Zeus, thou hast heard my prayer with willing heart, now, even now, with strong entreaty I pray thee that thou give this man a brave child of Eriboia's womb, that by award of fate my friend may gain a son of body as staunch as this hide that hangeth about me, which was of the beast that I slew at Nemea, first of all my labours; and let his soul be of like sort."[^pin-ist5-prayer]

Zeus "sent forth the king of birds, a mighty eagle, and sweet delight thrilled him within, and he spake aloud as a seer speaketh: 'Behold, the son whom thou askest shall be born unto thee, O Telamon': also after the bird's name that had appeared unto them he said that the child's name should be the mighty Aias, terrible in the strife of warring hosts."[^pin-ist5-eagle]

[^pin-ist5-lion]: "as he stood there in his lion's skin, then did Telamon their chief challenge Amphitryon's son of the mighty spear to make initiative libation of nectar, and handed on unto him the wine-cup rough with gold" (Pindar, Isthmian V, trans. Ernest Myers)
[^pin-ist5-prayer]: "now, even now, with strong entreaty I pray thee that thou give this man a brave child of Eriboia's womb, that by award of fate my friend may gain a son of body as staunch as this hide that hangeth about me, which was of the beast that I slew at Nemea, first of all my labours; and let his soul be of like sort" (Pindar, Isthmian V)
[^pin-ist5-eagle]: "the god sent forth the king of birds, a mighty eagle, and sweet delight thrilled him within, and he spake aloud as a seer speaketh: 'Behold, the son whom thou askest shall be born unto thee, O Telamon': also after the bird's name that had appeared unto them he said that the child's name should be the mighty Aias, terrible in the strife of warring hosts" (Pindar, Isthmian V)

### The Battle at Pylos (Olympian IX)

Pindar alludes to the tradition that Heracles fought against the gods at Pylos: "the hands of Herakles have wielded his club against the trident, when at Pylos [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) took his stand and prest hard on him, ay, and there prest him hard embattled Phoibos with his silver bow, neither would [Hades](../deities/hades.md) keep his staff unraised, wherewith he leadeth down to ways beneath the hollow earth the bodies of men that die."[^pin-pylos]

But Pindar immediately recoils from the tale: "O my mouth, fling this tale from thee, for to speak evil of gods is a hateful wisdom, and loud and unmeasured words strike a note that trembleth upon madness."[^pin-pylos-reject] This is characteristic of Pindar's theological sensitivity — as with the Tantalus cannibal feast in Olympian I, he refuses to tell stories he considers unworthy of the gods.

### The Founding of the Olympic Games (Olympian XI)

Pindar tells how Heracles founded the Olympic games after defeating Augeas. Heracles "slew Kleatos, Poseidon's goodly son, and slew also Eurytos, that he might wrest from tyrannous Augeas against his will reward for service done."[^pin-moliones] He lay in ambush at Kleonai because "these same violent sons of Molos made havoc of his own Tirynthian folk by hiding in the valleys of Elis." Then Augeas too "fell into captivity and escaped not precipitate death."[^pin-augeas]

Heracles then established the sacred precinct at Olympia: "the mighty son of Zeus having gathered together all his host at Pisa, and all the booty, measured a sacred grove for his sovereign Father; and having fenced round the Altis he marked the bounds thereof in a clear space." He "paid honour to the river Alpheos together with the twelve greatest gods. And he named it by the name of the Hill of Kronos; for theretofore it was without name, when Oinomaos was king."[^pin-altis]

Pindar lists the first Olympic victors: "In the foot-race down the straight course of the stadion was Likymnios' son Oionos first... in the wrestling was Tegea glorified by Echemos: Doryklos won the prize of boxing... and with the four-horse chariot, Samos of Mantinea."[^pin-first-games]

[^pin-pylos]: "the hands of Herakles have wielded his club against the trident, when at Pylos Poseidon took his stand and prest hard on him, ay, and there prest him hard embattled Phoibos with his silver bow, neither would Hades keep his staff unraised, wherewith he leadeth down to ways beneath the hollow earth the bodies of men that die" (Pindar, Olympian IX, trans. Ernest Myers)
[^pin-pylos-reject]: "O my mouth, fling this tale from thee, for to speak evil of gods is a hateful wisdom, and loud and unmeasured words strike a note that trembleth upon madness" (Pindar, Olympian IX)
[^pin-moliones]: "by the ancient tomb of Pelops the mighty Herakles founded, after that he slew Kleatos, Poseidon's goodly son, and slew also Eurytos, that he might wrest from tyrannous Augeas against his will reward for service done" (Pindar, Olympian XI)
[^pin-augeas]: "Likewise Augeas last of all in his perplexity fell into captivity and escaped not precipitate death" (Pindar, Olympian XI)
[^pin-altis]: "the mighty son of Zeus having gathered together all his host at Pisa, and all the booty, measured a sacred grove for his sovereign Father; and having fenced round the Altis he marked the bounds thereof in a clear space... and paid honour to the river Alpheos together with the twelve greatest gods. And he named it by the name of the Hill of Kronos; for theretofore it was without name, when Oinomaos was king" (Pindar, Olympian XI)
[^pin-first-games]: "In the foot-race down the straight course of the stadion was Likymnios' son Oionos first... in the wrestling was Tegea glorified by Echemos: Doryklos won the prize of boxing, a dweller in the city of Tiryns, and with the four-horse chariot, Samos of Mantinea" (Pindar, Olympian XI)

## In Euripides' [Alcestis](../sources/euripides-alcestis.md)

### Wrestling Death

Heracles arrives at Admetus's palace while on his way to capture the man-eating horses of Diomedes the Thracian, a labour for Eurystheus. He is characteristically fearless: "none there is, who shall ever see the son of Alcmena fearing the hand of his enemies."[^eur-alc-fearless] He mentions previous battles with sons of [Ares](../deities/ares.md): "if I must join in battle with the children whom Mars begat, first indeed with Lycaon, and again with Cycnus, and I come to this third combat."[^eur-alc-mars]

Admetus conceals his wife's death and insists on hosting Heracles, who feasts and drinks heavily, unaware of the mourning. When a servant finally reveals the truth, Heracles is immediately moved to action: "I must rescue the woman lately dead, Alcestis, and place her again in this house, and perform this service for Admetus."[^eur-alc-resolve]

He describes his plan to ambush Death at the tomb: "going I will lay wait for the sable-vested king of the departed, Death, and I think that I shall find him drinking of the libations near the tomb. And if having taken him by lying in wait, rushing from my ambush, I shall seize hold of him, and make a circle around him with mine arms, there is not who shall take him away panting as to his sides, until he release me the woman."[^eur-alc-ambush]

Heracles succeeds and returns with the veiled Alcestis. He tells Admetus: "Having fought a battle with the prince of those beneath... At the tomb itself, having seized him from ambush with my hands."[^eur-alc-victory]

[^eur-alc-fearless]: "none there is, who shall ever see the son of Alcmena fearing the hand of his enemies" (Alcestis 510-511, trans. T.A. Buckley)
[^eur-alc-mars]: "if I must join in battle with the children whom Mars begat, first indeed with Lycaon, and again with Cycnus, and I come to this third combat, about to engage with the horses and their master" (Alcestis 500-504)
[^eur-alc-resolve]: "I must rescue the woman lately dead, Alcestis, and place her again in this house, and perform this service for Admetus" (Alcestis 843-845)
[^eur-alc-ambush]: "going I will lay wait for the sable-vested king of the departed, Death, and I think that I shall find him drinking of the libations near the tomb. And if having taken him by lying in wait, rushing from my ambush, I shall seize hold of him, and make a circle around him with mine arms, there is not who shall take him away panting as to his sides, until he release me the woman" (Alcestis 845-852)
[^eur-alc-victory]: "Having fought a battle with the prince of those beneath... At the tomb itself, having seized him from ambush with my hands" (Alcestis 1140-1142)
