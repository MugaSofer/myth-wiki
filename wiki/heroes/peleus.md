## Overview

**Peleus** is the father of [Achilles](achilles.md) and husband of the sea-goddess [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md). His wedding was attended by all the gods, making it one of the great divine gatherings of Greek myth — and also the occasion at which Strife cast the apple that led to the Judgment of Paris and the [Trojan War](../sources/apollodorus.md).

## In the Bibliotheca

### Exile from Aegina (3.12.6)

Peleus was a son of Aeacus (son of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) and Aegina) and Endeis. "As Phocus excelled in athletic sports, his brothers Peleus and Telamon plotted against him, and the lot falling on Telamon, he killed his brother in a match by throwing a quoit at his head, and with the help of Peleus carried the body and hid it in a wood. But the murder being detected, the two were driven fugitives from Aegina by Aeacus."[^apd-exile]

### At Phthia and Iolcus (3.13.1-3)

Peleus "fled to Phthia to the court of Eurytion, son of Actor, and was purified by him, and he received from him his daughter Antigone and the third part of the country."[^apd-phthia] He then accidentally killed Eurytion while hunting the Calydonian boar and fled again to Acastus at Iolcus.

Astydamia, wife of Acastus, "fell in love with Peleus, and sent him a proposal for a meeting; and when she could not prevail on him she sent word to his wife that Peleus was about to marry Sterope, daughter of Acastus; on hearing which the wife of Peleus strung herself up." Astydamia then falsely accused Peleus to Acastus.[^apd-astydamia]

Acastus took Peleus hunting on Pelion, where he "cut out and put in his pouch the tongues of the animals that fell to him" while the others mocked him for catching nothing — but "he produced them the tongues, and said that he had taken just as many animals as he had tongues." When Peleus fell asleep, Acastus "deserted him, and hiding his sword in the cows' dung, returned." Peleus was caught by the centaurs "and would have perished, if he had not been saved by [Chiron](../creatures/chiron.md), who also restored him his sword."[^apd-pelion]

### Marriage to Thetis (3.13.5)

"[Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) and [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) had been rivals" for [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md)'s hand, "but when [Themis](../deities/themis.md) prophesied that the son born of Thetis would be mightier than his father, they withdrew." [Chiron](../creatures/chiron.md) advised Peleus "to seize her and hold her fast in spite of her shape-shifting," and Peleus "watched his chance and carried her off, and though she turned, now into fire, now into water, and now into a beast, he did not let her go till he saw that she had resumed her former shape."[^apd-marriage]

"And he married her on Pelion, and there the gods celebrated the marriage with feast and song. And Chiron gave Peleus an ashen spear, and Poseidon gave him horses, Balius and Xanthus, and these were immortal."[^apd-wedding]

### Achilles and Later Life (3.13.6-7)

When [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md) tried to make [Achilles](achilles.md) immortal by hiding him in fire at night, "Peleus watched her, and, seeing the child writhing on the fire, he cried out; and Thetis, thus prevented from accomplishing her purpose, forsook her infant son and departed to the Nereids." Peleus then brought the child to Chiron.[^apd-achilles]

Later, "Peleus, with Jason and the Dioscuri, laid waste Iolcus; and he slaughtered Astydamia, wife of Acastus, and, having divided her limb from limb, he led the army through her into the city."[^apd-revenge]

## In the Catalogue of Women

### The Myrmidons (Fragment 53)

The Catalogue gives the origin of the Myrmidons through Peleus's father Aeacus. When Aeacus "came to the full measure of desired youth, he chafed at being alone. And the father of men and gods made all the ants that were in the lovely isle into men and wide-girdled women." These became the first seafarers: "the first who fitted with thwarts ships with curved sides, and the first who used sails, the wings of a sea-going ship."[^cat-myrmidons]

[^cat-myrmidons]: "the father of men and gods made all the ants that were in the lovely isle into men and wide-girdled women. These were the first who fitted with thwarts ships with curved sides, and the first who used sails, the wings of a sea-going ship" (Catalogue of Women, Fragment 53, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

### Wedding Praise (Fragment 58)

The Catalogue preserves the speech of the people who witnessed Peleus's good fortune: "Thrice, yea, four times blessed son of Aeacus, happy Peleus! For far-seeing Olympian [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) has given you a wife with many gifts and the blessed gods have brought your marriage fully to pass, and in these halls you go up to the holy bed of a daughter of [Nereus](../deities/nereus.md)."[^cat-peleus-praise]

[^cat-peleus-praise]: "Thrice, yea, four times blessed son of Aeacus, happy Peleus! For far-seeing Olympian Zeus has given you a wife with many gifts and the blessed gods have brought your marriage fully to pass, and in these halls you go up to the holy bed of a daughter of Nereus" (Catalogue of Women, Fragment 58, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## In the Fabulae

### The Prophecy and Marriage to Thetis (§54)

The [Fabulae](../sources/hyginus.md) preserves the crucial prophecy about [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md) and her son: "A prediction about Thetis, the Nereid, was that her son would be greater than his father."[^hyg-prophecy] Only [Prometheus](../titans/prometheus.md) knew this secret, and when [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) wished to lie with Thetis, Prometheus struck a bargain: "Prometheus promised [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) that he would give him timely warning if he would free him from his chains."[^hyg-bargain]

The warning was stark: "he advised [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) not to lie with Thetis, for if one greater than he were born he might drive [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) from his kingdom, as he himself had done to Saturn."[^hyg-warning] Thus Thetis avoided Zeus and was "given in marriage to Peleus, son of Aeacus."[^hyg-marriage] As part of this exchange, "[Heracles](heracles.md) was sent to kill the eagle which was eating out Prometheus' heart. When it was killed, Prometheus after thirty thousand years was freed from Mount Caucasus."[^hyg-prometheus]

[^hyg-prophecy]: "A prediction about Thetis, the Nereid, was that her son would be greater than his father" (Fabulae §54, trans. Mary Grant)
