## Overview

**Peleus** is the father of [Achilles](achilles.md) and husband of the sea-goddess [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md). His wedding was attended by all the gods, making it one of the great divine gatherings of Greek myth — and also the occasion at which Strife cast the apple that led to the Judgment of Paris and the [Trojan War](../sources/apollodorus.md).

## In the Bibliotheca

### Exile from Aegina (3.12.6)

Peleus was a son of Aeacus (son of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) and Aegina) and Endeis. "As Phocus excelled in athletic sports, his brothers Peleus and Telamon plotted against him, and the lot falling on Telamon, he killed his brother in a match by throwing a quoit at his head, and with the help of Peleus carried the body and hid it in a wood. But the murder being detected, the two were driven fugitives from Aegina by Aeacus."[^apd-exile]

### At Phthia and Iolcus (3.13.1-3)

Peleus "fled to Phthia to the court of Eurytion, son of Actor, and was purified by him, and he received from him his daughter Antigone and the third part of the country."[^apd-phthia] He then accidentally killed Eurytion while hunting the Calydonian boar and fled again to Acastus at Iolcus.

Astydamia, wife of Acastus, "fell in love with Peleus, and sent him a proposal for a meeting; and when she could not prevail on him she sent word to his wife that Peleus was about to marry Sterope, daughter of Acastus; on hearing which the wife of Peleus strung herself up." Astydamia then falsely accused Peleus to Acastus.[^apd-astydamia]

Acastus took Peleus hunting on Pelion, where he "cut out and put in his pouch the tongues of the animals that fell to him" while the others mocked him for catching nothing — but "he produced them the tongues, and said that he had taken just as many animals as he had tongues." When Peleus fell asleep, Acastus "deserted him, and hiding his sword in the cows' dung, returned." Peleus was caught by the centaurs "and would have perished, if he had not been saved by [Chiron](../creatures/chiron.md), who also restored him his sword."[^apd-pelion]

### Marriage to Thetis (3.13.5)

"[Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) and [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) had been rivals" for [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md)'s hand, "but when [Themis](../deities/themis.md) prophesied that the son born of Thetis would be mightier than his father, they withdrew." [Chiron](../creatures/chiron.md) advised Peleus "to seize her and hold her fast in spite of her shape-shifting," and Peleus "watched his chance and carried her off, and though she turned, now into fire, now into water, and now into a beast, he did not let her go till he saw that she had resumed her former shape."[^apd-marriage]

"And he married her on Pelion, and there the gods celebrated the marriage with feast and song. And Chiron gave Peleus an ashen spear, and Poseidon gave him horses, Balius and Xanthus, and these were immortal."[^apd-wedding]

### Achilles and Later Life (3.13.6-7)

When [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md) tried to make [Achilles](achilles.md) immortal by hiding him in fire at night, "Peleus watched her, and, seeing the child writhing on the fire, he cried out; and Thetis, thus prevented from accomplishing her purpose, forsook her infant son and departed to the Nereids." Peleus then brought the child to Chiron.[^apd-achilles]

Later, "Peleus, with Jason and the Dioscuri, laid waste Iolcus; and he slaughtered Astydamia, wife of Acastus, and, having divided her limb from limb, he led the army through her into the city."[^apd-revenge]

## In the [Argonautica](../sources/argonautica.md)

### Exile and the Argonaut Voyage

The Argonautica alludes to Peleus's exile, noting he had killed his half-brother Phocus and so fled with [Telamon](../heroes/telamon.md).[^arg-pel-exile]

### The Boar That Slew Idmon

During the voyage, when the seer Idmon was killed by a boar in the Mariandynian land, it was Peleus who slew the boar that had mortally wounded him.[^arg-pel-boar]

### After the Death of Tiphys

When the helmsman Tiphys also died shortly after, the heroes fell into mourning and despair. Peleus rallied them: "Let our courage endure, for this doom has come by heaven's will."[^arg-pel-rally]

### Riddle of the Libyan Nymphs

In the Libyan desert, where the heroes had to carry the Argo on their shoulders, nymphs appeared and spoke a riddling prophecy about "the mother" repaying them. It was Peleus who interpreted this: the "mother" was the ship herself, and they must carry the Argo to the sea.[^arg-pel-riddle]

### Thetis at Aeaea

On the island of Aeaea, [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md) appeared to Peleus — this was their first meeting since she had left him in fury. She had abandoned him when he woke and cried out as she held infant [Achilles](achilles.md) in fire, intending to make the boy immortal by burning away his mortal nature. Her purpose was interrupted and she departed to the Nereids.[^arg-pel-thetis]

[^arg-pel-exile]: Peleus was exiled after killing his half-brother Phocus, referred to in the Argonautica 1.90-92 (trans. R.C. Seaton)
[^arg-pel-boar]: "Peleus slew the mighty boar" that mortally wounded Idmon (Argonautica 2.826-828, trans. R.C. Seaton)
[^arg-pel-rally]: Peleus urged the heroes not to grieve but to take courage after Tiphys's death (Argonautica 2.897-898, trans. R.C. Seaton)

## In the Catalogue of Women

### The Myrmidons (Fragment 53)

The Catalogue gives the origin of the Myrmidons through Peleus's father Aeacus. When Aeacus "came to the full measure of desired youth, he chafed at being alone. And the father of men and gods made all the ants that were in the lovely isle into men and wide-girdled women." These became the first seafarers: "the first who fitted with thwarts ships with curved sides, and the first who used sails, the wings of a sea-going ship."[^cat-myrmidons]

[^cat-myrmidons]: "the father of men and gods made all the ants that were in the lovely isle into men and wide-girdled women. These were the first who fitted with thwarts ships with curved sides, and the first who used sails, the wings of a sea-going ship" (Catalogue of Women, Fragment 53, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

### Wedding Praise (Fragment 58)

The Catalogue preserves the speech of the people who witnessed Peleus's good fortune: "Thrice, yea, four times blessed son of Aeacus, happy Peleus! For far-seeing Olympian [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) has given you a wife with many gifts and the blessed gods have brought your marriage fully to pass, and in these halls you go up to the holy bed of a daughter of [Nereus](../deities/nereus.md)."[^cat-peleus-praise]

[^cat-peleus-praise]: "Thrice, yea, four times blessed son of Aeacus, happy Peleus! For far-seeing Olympian Zeus has given you a wife with many gifts and the blessed gods have brought your marriage fully to pass, and in these halls you go up to the holy bed of a daughter of Nereus" (Catalogue of Women, Fragment 58, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## In the Fabulae

### The Prophecy and Marriage to Thetis (§54)

The [Fabulae](../sources/hyginus.md) preserves the crucial prophecy about [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md) and her son: "A prediction about Thetis, the Nereid, was that her son would be greater than his father."[^hyg-prophecy] Only [Prometheus](../titans/prometheus.md) knew this secret, and when [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) wished to lie with Thetis, Prometheus struck a bargain: "Prometheus promised [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) that he would give him timely warning if he would free him from his chains."[^hyg-bargain]

The warning was stark: "he advised [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) not to lie with Thetis, for if one greater than he were born he might drive [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) from his kingdom, as he himself had done to Saturn."[^hyg-warning] Thus Thetis avoided Zeus and was "given in marriage to Peleus, son of Aeacus."[^hyg-marriage] As part of this exchange, "[Heracles](heracles.md) was sent to kill the eagle which was eating out Prometheus' heart. When it was killed, Prometheus after thirty thousand years was freed from Mount Caucasus."[^hyg-prometheus]

[^hyg-prophecy]: "A prediction about Thetis, the Nereid, was that her son would be greater than his father" (Fabulae §54, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-bargain]: "Prometheus promised Jove that he would give him timely warning if he would free him from his chains" (Fabulae §54, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-warning]: "he advised Jove not to lie with Thetis, for if one greater than he were born he might drive Jove from his kingdom, as he himself had done to Saturn" (Fabulae §54, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-marriage]: "Thetis was given in marriage to Peleus, son of Aeacus" (Fabulae §54, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-prometheus]: "Hercules was sent to kill the eagle which was eating out Prometheus' heart. When it was killed, Prometheus after thirty thousand years was freed from Mount Caucasus" (Fabulae §54, trans. Mary Grant)

## In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md)

### Winning Thetis (11.221-265)

The Metamorphoses gives a detailed account of Peleus's capture of [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md). Proteus had prophesied that Thetis would bear "a youth who by heroic actions will surpass the deeds of his own father," so [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md), "although the flame of love for Thetis burned his breast, would not embrace the lovely daughter of the sea, and urged his grandson Peleus, son of Aeacus, to wed the green haired maid."[^met-pel-prophecy]

Thetis would come naked to a myrtle-shaded cave, "seated on her dolphin, which was harnessed." Peleus seized her while she slept, "and after he had tried to win her by entreaties, while she long continued to resist him, he resolved to conquer her by violence." She shape-shifted: "At first she was a bird, but while she seemed a bird he held her fast; and then she changed herself to a large tree... her third disguise was as a spotted tigress, which frightened him so that he lost his hold."[^met-pel-shapes]

Peleus prayed to the sea-gods, and Proteus advised him to bind her with cords while she slept. When Peleus next seized her, "she changed her shape and persevered until convinced she could not overcome his hold — for her two arms were forced apart — she groaned and said, 'You could not overcome me in this way, but some divinity has given you the power.'" She then appeared as herself, and "Peleus saw her now deprived of all deceptions, he embraced her and was father of the great [Achilles](achilles.md)."[^met-pel-achilles]

### Exile at Trachis (11.266-289)

Peleus was "blest in everything, except in killing Phocus" — the murder of his half-brother. He fled to Trachis, where King Ceyx received him hospitably.[^met-pel-exile]

[^met-pel-prophecy]: "you shall be the mother of a youth who by heroic actions will surpass the deeds of his own father, and your son shall be superior to his father's power. So Jupiter, although the flame of love for Thetis burned his breast, would not embrace the lovely daughter of the sea" (Metamorphoses 11.223-228, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-pel-shapes]: "At first she was a bird, but while she seemed a bird he held her fast; and then she changed herself to a large tree, and Peleus clung with ardor to the tree; her third disguise was as a spotted tigress, which frightened him so that he lost his hold" (Metamorphoses 11.241-247)
[^met-pel-achilles]: "she groaned and said, 'You could not overcome me in this way, but some divinity has given you the power.' Then she appeared as Thetis: and, when Peleus saw her now deprived of all deceptions, he embraced her and was father of the great Achilles" (Metamorphoses 11.259-264)
[^met-pel-exile]: "Great Peleus' heart was filled with happiness; because of his great son and Thetis his dear wife: he was blest in everything, except in killing Phocus. The Trachinian land received him guilty of his brother's blood" (Metamorphoses 11.266-270)

## In [Pindar](../sources/pindar.md)

### Brief Mentions (Nemean III)

Pindar praises Peleus in a single vivid phrase: "Glad was King Peleus when he cut him his gigantic spear, he who took Iolkos by his single arm without help of any host, he who held firm in the struggle Thetis the daughter of the sea."[^pin-nem3-peleus]

[^pin-nem3-peleus]: "Glad was King Peleus when he cut him his gigantic spear, he who took Iolkos by his single arm without help of any host, he who held firm in the struggle Thetis the daughter of the sea" (Pindar, Nemean III, trans. Ernest Myers)

### Hippolyte's False Accusation (Nemean IV)

Pindar alludes to the accusation of Akastos' wife in Nemean IV, linking it to Peleus's subsequent trials. [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md) is at stake: Peleus "proved the guileful counsels of Hippolyte, Akastos' wife." Akastos, "by stealing his sword of cunning workmanship... prepared death for him in an ambush; but Cheiron delivered him out of his hand." Having survived the fire and the wild beasts that came with [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md)'s shape-shifting — "having escaped the violence of the fire and the dauntless lion's claws exceeding keen, and the bitings of teeth most terrible" — Peleus "espoused one of the Nereids high-enthroned, and beheld the circle of fair seats whereon were sitting the kings of heaven and of the sea, as they revealed unto him their gifts, and the kingdom that should be unto him and unto his seed."[^pin-nem4-peleus]

[^pin-nem4-peleus]: "he proved the guileful counsels of Hippolyte, Akastos' wife. For by stealing his sword of cunning workmanship the son of Pelias prepared death for him in an ambush; but Cheiron delivered him out of his hand; and thus he fulfilled the destiny ordained him of Zeus, and having escaped the violence of the fire and the dauntless lion's claws exceeding keen, and the bitings of teeth most terrible, he espoused one of the Nereids high-enthroned, and beheld the circle of fair seats whereon were sitting the kings of heaven and of the sea, as they revealed unto him their gifts, and the kingdom that should be unto him and unto his seed" (Pindar, Nemean IV, trans. Ernest Myers)

### The Full Story of Hippolyte (Nemean V)

Pindar gives a more detailed account in Nemean V, where the Muses' choir at Pelion sang of Thetis and Peleus. Hippolyte — named here as "Kretheus' dainty daughter" — "forged a lying tale thereto devised, how that he essayed to go in unto her in Akastos' bridal bed. But the truth was wholly contrary thereto, for often and with all her soul she had besought him with beguiling speech; but her bold words vexed his spirit; and forthwith he refused the bride, fearing the wrath of the Father who guardeth host and guest."[^pin-nem5-hippolyte]

His reward was swift: "And he, the cloud-compelling Zeus in heaven, the immortal's king, was aware thereof, and he promised him that with all speed he would find him a sea-bride from among the Nereids of golden distaffs."[^pin-nem5-promise]

[^pin-nem5-hippolyte]: "she forged a lying tale thereto devised, how that he essayed to go in unto her in Akastos' bridal bed. But the truth was wholly contrary thereto, for often and with all her soul she had besought him with beguiling speech; but her bold words vexed his spirit; and forthwith he refused the bride, fearing the wrath of the Father who guardeth host and guest" (Pindar, Nemean V, trans. Ernest Myers)
[^pin-nem5-promise]: "he promised him that with all speed he would find him a sea-bride from among the Nereids of golden distaffs" (Pindar, Nemean V)

### Thetis Given to Peleus (Isthmian VII)

In Isthmian VII, [Themis](../deities/themis.md) counselled the gods to give [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md) to Peleus: "My counsel is that ye give her to be the heaven-sent prize of Peleus son of Aiakos, whom the speech of men showeth to be their most righteous, an offspring of Iolkos' plain."[^pin-ist7-peleus]

[^pin-ist7-peleus]: "My counsel is that ye give her to be the heaven-sent prize of Peleus son of Aiakos, whom the speech of men showeth to be their most righteous, an offspring of Iolkos' plain" (Pindar, Isthmian VII, trans. Ernest Myers)
