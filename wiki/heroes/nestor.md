## Overview

**Nestor**, son of Neleus, is the king of Pylos and the oldest of the Greek chiefs at [Troy](../places/troy.md). His defining traits are his honey-sweet eloquence, his extraordinary age (he has lived through three generations of men), and his role as counsellor to the Greek host. He survived the sack of Pylos by [Heracles](heracles.md) because he was being raised among the Gerenians.

## In the Iliad

### The Three Generations (Book I)

Nestor's age is his most remarkable attribute. "Two generations of mortal men already had he seen perish, that had been of old time born and nurtured with him in goodly Pylos, and he was king among the third."[^il1-generations] He uses this great age as the basis for his authority, frequently recounting deeds of his youth that outstrip anything the current generation has done.

### Nestor's Cup (Book XI)

When [Machaon](../sources/iliad.md) is brought wounded to Nestor's tent, a remarkable cup is described: "a right goodly cup, that the old man brought from home, embossed with studs of gold, and four handles there were to it, and round each two golden doves were feeding, and to the cup were two feet below. Another man could scarce have lifted the cup from the table, when it was full, but Nestor the Old raised it easily."[^il11-cup]

[^il1-generations]: "Two generations of mortal men already had he seen perish, that had been of old time born and nurtured with him in goodly Pylos, and he was king among the third" (Iliad 1.251-253, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

Another man could scarce have lifted the cup from the table, when it was full, but Nestor the Old raised it easily" (Iliad 11.638-643)

## In the Odyssey

### Telemachus's Visit (Book III)

In [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) Book III, [Telemachus](telemachus.md) visits Nestor at Pylos seeking news of his father. Nestor receives him with generous hospitality but has no direct news of [Odysseus](odysseus.md)'s fate, and sends Telemachus onward to Sparta with his son Pisistratus as escort.

## In the Bibliotheca

### Parentage and Survival (1.9.9, 2.7.3)

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) records Nestor as son of Neleus and Chloris, daughter of Amphion. Neleus had many sons, including Periclymenus, "whom [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) granted the power of changing his shape."[^apd-periclymenus]

When [Heracles](heracles.md) ravaged Pylos, "he slew Periclymenus, the most valiant of the sons of Neleus, who used to change his shape in battle. And he slew Neleus and his sons, except Nestor; for he was a youth and was being brought up among the Gerenians."[^apd-survival] This explains Nestor's epithet "of Gerenia" — the place that saved his life.

### The Trojan War (E.3.12)

Nestor brought forty ships from Pylos to the war against [Troy](../places/troy.md).[^apd-ships]

[^apd-periclymenus]: "Periclymenus, whom Poseidon granted the power of changing his shape" (Bibliotheca 1.9.9, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-survival]: "he slew Neleus and his sons, except Nestor; for he was a youth and was being brought up among the Gerenians" (Bibliotheca 2.7.3, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-ships]: "Of the Pylians, Nestor, son of Neleus and Chloris: forty ships" (Bibliotheca E.3.12, trans. J.G. Frazer)

## In the Epic Cycle

In the Returns, Nestor is among those who get safely home: "Diomedes and Nestor put out to sea and get safely home."[^ret-nestor]

[^ret-nestor]: "Diomedes and Nestor put out to sea and get safely home" (Returns, summary by Proclus, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## In the Posthomerica

### Grief for Antilochus, and Confronting Memnon (Book II)

When [Memnon](memnon.md) entered the battle, he drove toward Nestor specifically, killing two of Nestor's men from Pylos ("which followed Nestor to the god-built burg of Ilium"). He then slew Antilochus — Nestor's beloved son — in direct sight of the old man: "no more bitter pang smiteth the heart of man than when a son perishes, and his father sees him die. Therefore, albeit unused to melting mood, his soul was torn with agony for the son by black death slain."[^post2-grief]

Nestor cried out to his other son Thrasymedes to help him defend Antilochus's body, demanding courage in terms of family honour: "If thou flinch for fear, no son of mine art thou, nor of the line of Periclymenus, who dared withstand Hercules' self."[^post2-periclymenus]

He then drove his own war-chariot against Memnon to avenge his son, despite his age — "himself too burned to fight from his war-car; for yearning for the dead goaded him to the fray beyond his strength."[^post2-chariot] Memnon, recognising the old man, stayed his hand out of respect, crying: "Ancient, it were my shame to fight with one so much mine elder: I am not blind unto honour... Draw thou back afar from battle-toil and bitter death. Go, lest, how loth soe'er, I smite thee of sore need."[^post2-memnon-spare]

Nestor replied with defiance: "None would name fool the father who essayed, battling with foes for his son's sake, to thrust the ruthless slayer back from that dear corpse. Ah, but that yet my strength were whole in me, that thou might'st know my spear! Now canst thou vaunt proudly enow: a young man's heart is bold and light his wit... But me the grievous weight of age bows down, like an old lion whom a cur may boldly drive back from the fold."[^post2-nestor-reply] He then withdrew, acknowledging the limits of his age, and appealed to [Achilles](achilles.md) to avenge Antilochus, which Achilles did by killing Memnon.[^post2-appeal]

[^post2-grief]: "no more bitter pang smiteth the heart of man than when a son perishes, and his father sees him die. Therefore, albeit unused to melting mood, his soul was torn with agony for the son by black death slain" (Posthomerica 2.1770-1775, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post2-periclymenus]: "If thou flinch for fear, no son of mine art thou, nor of the line of Periclymenus, who dared withstand Hercules' self" (Posthomerica 2.1783-1785, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post2-chariot]: "himself too burned to fight from his war-car; for yearning for the dead goaded him to the fray beyond his strength" (Posthomerica 2.1820-1822, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post2-memnon-spare]: "'Ancient, it were my shame to fight with one so much mine elder: I am not blind unto honour... Draw thou back afar from battle-toil and bitter death. Go, lest, how loth soe'er, I smite thee of sore need. Nay, fall not thou beside thy son, against a mightier man fighting, lest men with folly thee should charge, for folly it is that braves o'ermastering might'" (Posthomerica 2.1828-1839, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post2-nestor-reply]: "'None would name fool the father who essayed, battling with foes for his son's sake, to thrust the ruthless slayer back from that dear corpse... But me the grievous weight of age bows down, like an old lion whom a cur may boldly drive back from the fold, for that he cannot, in his wrath's despite, maintain his own cause, being toothless now, and strengthless, and his strong heart tamed by time'" (Posthomerica 2.1842-1857, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post2-appeal]: "Then to the side of Aeacus' mighty son came Nestor. Anguished for his son he cried: 'Achilles, thou great bulwark of the Greeks, slain is my child! The armour of my dead hath Memnon, and I fear me lest his corse be cast a prey to dogs. Haste to his help!'" (Posthomerica 2.1922-1929, trans. A.S. Way)

### Counselling Agamemnon to Tend Achilles' Body (Book III)

After Achilles' death, grief engulfed the Achaean host. As the wailing threatened to continue through the night, Nestor spoke up — "whose own heart bare its load of grief remembering his own son Antilochus" — to counsel Agamemnon: "O mighty Agamemnon, sceptre-lord of Argives, from wide-shrilling lamentation refrain we for this day. None shall withhold hereafter these from all their heart's desire of weeping and lamenting many days. But now go to, from aweless Aeacus' son wash we the foul blood-gouts, and lay we him upon a couch: unseemly it is to shame the dead by leaving them untended long."[^post3-counsel]

Quintus describes him as "Nestor, whose own heart bare its load of grief"[^post3-grief] — indicating the counsel was offered despite the old man's own bereavement over Antilochus, recently killed. His advice was immediately followed: caldrons were heated, the body washed, and Achilles laid upon a couch in his sea-purple robe.

[^post3-counsel]: "'O mighty Agamemnon, sceptre-lord of Argives, from wide-shrilling lamentation refrain we for this day. None shall withhold hereafter these from all their heart's desire of weeping and lamenting many days. But now go to, from aweless Aeacus' son wash we the foul blood-gouts, and lay we him upon a couch: unseemly it is to shame the dead by leaving them untended long'" (Posthomerica 3.2894-2902, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post3-grief]: "Nestor, whose own heart bare its load of grief remembering his own son Antilochus" (Posthomerica 3.2892-2893, trans. A.S. Way)

### Song at the Funeral Games (Book IV)

At the funeral games of Achilles, Thetis summoned the champions. Nestor rose first — not to compete physically ("for his arms and all his sinews were with grievous eld outworn") but to sing. The Posthomerica presents him as unequalled in the assembly as an orator: "of all the Achaeans none could match himself against him in the folkmote's war of words; yea, even Laertes' glorious son to him ever gave place when men for speech were met; nor he alone, but even the kingliest of Argives, Agamemnon, lord of spears."[^post4-orator]

He sang of Thetis's beauty as the chief of the Nereids, then of the wedding of Peleus — the feast, the Muses' song, the Hours, the Graces, Chiron's cavern, and the gods gathered in celebration. He then sang of Achilles' deeds, "with fitly chosen words," praising twelve cities sacked at sea and eleven on land, recounting Telephus, Eetion, Cygnus, Hector, Penthesilea, and Memnon, and Achilles' superhuman form.[^post4-song] "Last, he prayed Heaven that he might see a son like that great sire from sea-washed Scyros come."[^post4-prayer] Thetis was "well-pleased" and rewarded him with the fleet-footed horses that Telephus had given Achilles at Caicus' mouth.[^post4-reward]

Later in the games, when Ajax and Diomedes had wrestled to two falls each and seemed about to continue, Nestor rose and intervened: "From grapple of wrestling, noble sons, forbear; for all we know that ye be mightiest of Argives since the great Achilles died."[^post4-wrestling] They heeded him and ceased.

He also shamed the younger men into competing in the boxing when none would step forward: "Friends, it were shame that men should shun the play of clenched hands, who in that noble sport have skill, wherein young men delight, which links glory to toil. Ah that my thews were strong as when we held King Pelias' funeral-feast, I and Acastus, kinsmen joining hands, when I with godlike Polydeuces stood in gauntlet-strife, in even-balanced fray..."[^post4-boxing-shame]

[^post4-orator]: "of all the Achaeans none could match himself against him in the folkmote's war of words; yea, even Laertes' glorious son to him ever gave place when men for speech were met; nor he alone, but even the kingliest of Argives, Agamemnon, lord of spears" (Posthomerica 4.3392-3397, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post4-song]: "From that beginning with fitly chosen words did he extol the glorious hero; how he voyaged and smote twelve cities; how he marched o'er leagues on leagues of land, and spoiled eleven; how he slew Telephus and Eetion's might renowned in Thebe; how his spear laid Cyenus low, Poseidon's son, and godlike Polydorus, Troilus the goodly, princely Asteropaeus; and how he dyed with blood the river-streams of Xanthus... how he smote down Hector; how he slew Penthesileia, and the godlike son of splendour-throned Dawn" (Posthomerica 4.3421-3438, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post4-prayer]: "Last, he prayed Heaven that he might see a son like that great sire from sea-washed Scyros come" (Posthomerica 4.3448-3449, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post4-reward]: "silver-footed Thetis smiled, and gave the singer fleetfoot horses, given of old beside Caicus' mouth by Telephus to Achilles" (Posthomerica 4.3451-3455, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post4-wrestling]: "'From grapple of wrestling, noble sons, forbear; for all we know that ye be mightiest of Argives since the great Achilles died'" (Posthomerica 4.3552-3554, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post4-boxing-shame]: "'Friends, it were shame that men should shun the play of clenched hands, who in that noble sport have skill, wherein young men delight, which links glory to toil. Ah that my thews were strong as when we held King Pelias' funeral-feast, I and Acastus, kinsmen joining hands, when I with godlike Polydeuces stood in gauntlet-strife, in even-balanced fray, and when Ancaeus in the wrestlers' ring mightier than all beside, yet feared and shrank from me, and dared not strive with me that day'" (Posthomerica 4.3597-3614, trans. A.S. Way)

### Consoling Podaleirius After Machaon's Death (Book VII)

After [Machaon](machaon.md) was killed by [Eurypylus](eurypylus.md), his brother [Podaleirius](podaleirius.md) was so overcome with grief that he attempted to kill himself on the tomb, clutching his sword and seeking deadly drugs. Nestor heard of this and came to him, drawing him back from the grave with a consolation speech that is one of the Posthomerica's longest and most developed.

He began with a practical argument — "Refrain from bitter moan and deadly grief, my son. It is not for a wise man's honour to wail, as doth a woman, o'er the fallen. Thou shalt not bring him up to light again whose soul hath fleeted vanishing into air, whose body fire hath ravined up, whose bones earth has received." He then appealed from personal example: "Endure thy sore grief, even as I endured, who lost a son, slain by the hands of foes, a son not worse than thy Machaon, good with spears in battle, good in counsel. None of all the youths so loved his sire as he loved me. He died for me — yea, died to save his father. Yet, when he was slain, did I endure to taste food, and to see the light."[^post7-nestor-console1]

When Podaleirius protested the depth of his grief for a brother who had raised him after their father's death, Nestor replied with a philosophical meditation on fate: "To all men Fate assigns one same sad lot, bereavement: earth shall cover all alike, albeit we tread not the same path of life... Good things and bad lie on the knees of Gods unnumbered, indistinguishably blent. These no Immortal seeth; they are veiled in mystic cloud-folds. Only Fate puts forth her hands thereto, nor looks at what she takes, but casts them from Olympus down to earth... The good man oft is whelmed in suffering: wealth undeserved is heaped on the vile person. Blind is each man's life; therefore he never walketh surely; oft he stumbleth: ever devious is his path, now sloping down to sorrow, mounting now to bliss."[^post7-nestor-console2]

He closed with hope and consolation for Machaon specifically: "Both to God and man dear was thy brother, good to brother-men, and son of an Immortal. Sure am I that to the company of Gods shall he ascend, by intercession of thy sire."[^post7-machaon]

Then "raised he that reluctant mourner up with comfortable words. From that dark grave he drew him, backward gazing oft with groans."[^post7-result] This is a distinctive portrait of Nestor in the Posthomerica — not the boastful elder of the Iliad, but a man who uses his own grief as the basis of genuine consolation.

[^post7-nestor-console1]: "'Refrain from bitter moan and deadly grief, my son. It is not for a wise man's honour to wail, as doth a woman, o'er the fallen. Thou shalt not bring him up to light again whose soul hath fleeted vanishing into air... Endure thy sore grief, even as I endured, who lost a son, slain by the hands of foes, a son not worse than thy Machaon... He died for me — yea, died to save his father. Yet, when he was slain, did I endure to taste food, and to see the light, well knowing that all men must tread one path Hades-ward, and before all lies one goal, death's mournful goal'" (Posthomerica 7.5565-5583, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post7-nestor-console2]: "'To all men Fate assigns one same sad lot, bereavement: earth shall cover all alike... Good things and bad lie on the knees of Gods unnumbered, indistinguishably blent. These no Immortal seeth; they are veiled in mystic cloud-folds. Only Fate puts forth her hands thereto, nor looks at what she takes, but casts them from Olympus down to earth... The good man oft is whelmed in suffering: wealth undeserved is heaped on the vile person. Blind is each man's life; therefore he never walketh surely; oft he stumbleth: ever devious is his path, now sloping down to sorrow, mounting now to bliss'" (Posthomerica 7.5598-5614, trans. A.S. Way)

[^post7-result]: "Then raised he that reluctant mourner up with comfortable words. From that dark grave he drew him, backward gazing oft with groans" (Posthomerica 7.5629-5631, trans. A.S. Way)

### Urging Departure After the Sack (Book XIV)

After the sacrifice of [Polyxena](polyxena.md) and the stilling of the seas, Nestor spoke at the feast to urge the Greeks to sail for home: "Hear, friends, who have 'scaped the long turmoil of war, that I may say to you one welcome word: now is the hour of heart's delight, the hour of home-return. Away! Achilles' soul hath ceased from ruinous wrath; Earth-shaker stills the stormy wave, and gentle breezes blow; no more the waves toss high. Haste, hale the ships down to the sea. Now, ho for home-return!"[^post14-depart]

[^post14-depart]: "'Hear, friends, who have 'scaped the long turmoil of war, that I may say to you one welcome word: now is the hour of heart's delight, the hour of home-return. Away! Achilles' soul hath ceased from ruinous wrath; Earth-shaker stills the stormy wave, and gentle breezes blow; no more the waves toss high. Haste, hale the ships down to the sea. Now, ho for home-return!'" (Posthomerica 14.10416-10424, trans. A.S. Way)
