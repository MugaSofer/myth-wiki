## Overview

**Nestor**, son of Neleus, is the king of Pylos and the oldest of the Greek chiefs at [Troy](../places/troy.md). His defining traits are his honey-sweet eloquence, his extraordinary age (he has lived through three generations of men), and his role as counsellor to the Greek host. He survived the sack of Pylos by [Heracles](heracles.md) because he was being raised among the Gerenians.

## In the Iliad

### The Three Generations (Book I)

Nestor's age is his most remarkable attribute. "Two generations of mortal men already had he seen perish, that had been of old time born and nurtured with him in goodly Pylos, and he was king among the third."[^il1-generations] He uses this great age as the basis for his authority, frequently recounting deeds of his youth that outstrip anything the current generation has done.

### Nestor's Cup (Book XI)

When [Machaon](../sources/iliad.md) is brought wounded to Nestor's tent, a remarkable cup is described: "a right goodly cup, that the old man brought from home, embossed with studs of gold, and four handles there were to it, and round each two golden doves were feeding, and to the cup were two feet below. Another man could scarce have lifted the cup from the table, when it was full, but Nestor the Old raised it easily."[^il11-cup]

[^il1-generations]: "Two generations of mortal men already had he seen perish, that had been of old time born and nurtured with him in goodly Pylos, and he was king among the third" (Iliad 1.251-253, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il11-cup]: "a right goodly cup, that the old man brought from home, embossed with studs of gold, and four handles there were to it, and round each two golden doves were feeding, and to the cup were two feet below. Another man could scarce have lifted the cup from the table, when it was full, but Nestor the Old raised it easily" (Iliad 11.638-643)

## In the Odyssey

### Telemachus's Visit (Book III)

In [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) Book III, [Telemachus](telemachus.md) visits Nestor at Pylos seeking news of his father. Nestor receives him with generous hospitality but has no direct news of [Odysseus](odysseus.md)'s fate, and sends Telemachus onward to Sparta with his son Pisistratus as escort.

## In the Bibliotheca

### Parentage and Survival (1.9.9, 2.7.3)

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) records Nestor as son of Neleus and Chloris, daughter of Amphion. Neleus had many sons, including Periclymenus, "whom [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) granted the power of changing his shape."[^apd-periclymenus]

When [Heracles](heracles.md) ravaged Pylos, "he slew Periclymenus, the most valiant of the sons of Neleus, who used to change his shape in battle. And he slew Neleus and his sons, except Nestor; for he was a youth and was being brought up among the Gerenians."[^apd-survival] This explains Nestor's epithet "of Gerenia" — the place that saved his life.

### The Trojan War (E.3.12)

Nestor brought forty ships from Pylos to the war against [Troy](../places/troy.md).[^apd-ships]

[^apd-periclymenus]: "Periclymenus, whom Poseidon granted the power of changing his shape" (Bibliotheca 1.9.9, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-survival]: "he slew Neleus and his sons, except Nestor; for he was a youth and was being brought up among the Gerenians" (Bibliotheca 2.7.3, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-ships]: "Of the Pylians, Nestor, son of Neleus and Chloris: forty ships" (Bibliotheca E.3.12, trans. J.G. Frazer)

## In the Epic Cycle

In the Returns, Nestor is among those who get safely home: "Diomedes and Nestor put out to sea and get safely home."[^ret-nestor]

[^ret-nestor]: "Diomedes and Nestor put out to sea and get safely home" (Returns, summary by Proclus, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
