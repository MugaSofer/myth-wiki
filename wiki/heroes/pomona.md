## Overview

**Pomona** was a Latin hamadryad renowned for her skill with orchards and fruit trees — "none of all the Latin hamadryads could attend her garden with more skill, and none was more attentive to the fruitful trees, because of them her name was given to her."[^met-pom-skill] She had no interest in wilderness or rivers, only cultivated land and fruitful boughs.

### The Orchardist (14.623-641)

Pomona's life was defined by her craft. "Her right hand never felt a javelin's weight, always she loved to hold a sharp curved pruning-knife" with which she cropped overgrown shoots, reduced straggling branches, and engrafted suckers into divided bark to nourish new growth.[^met-pom-knife] She watered "every winding thread of twisting roots with freshly flowing streams."[^met-pom-water]

### Rejecting Suitors (14.634-641)

She "never felt the least desire of love; but fearful of some rustic's violence, she had her orchard closed within a wall; and both forbade and fled the approach of males."[^met-pom-wall] Satyrs, Pans, Silenus, and Priapus all pursued her in vain.

### Vertumnus's Courtship (14.642-771)

[Vertumnus](../deities/vertumnus.md) exceeded all other suitors in his love but was no more fortunate. He assumed countless disguises — a rough reaper carrying barley ears, a haymaker, an ox-driver, a pruner, a fruit-picker, a soldier, a fisherman — and "by means of many shapes he often had obtained access to her and joyed in seeing her beauty."[^met-pom-disguises]

Finally, disguised as an old woman, Vertumnus entered her garden and praised her beauty. He argued, using the example of an elm embracing a vine, that she should not reject marriage. He told the cautionary tale of [Iphis and Anaxarete](../events/iphis-and-anaxarete.md) — a cruel maiden turned to stone for her heartlessness — and warned Pomona to fear "avenging deities."[^met-pom-warning]

When these words failed, "he laid the old woman's form aside and was again a youth. On her he seemed to blaze, as when the full light of the brilliant Sun, after it has dispelled opposing clouds, has shone forth with not one to intercept."[^met-pom-reveal] He prepared to use force, "but there was then no need of force. The lovely nymph was charmed, was captivated by the god's bright form and felt a passion answering to his love."[^met-pom-love]
