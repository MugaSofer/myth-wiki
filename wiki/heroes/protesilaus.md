## Overview

**Protesilaus** was the leader of the contingent from Phylace and the first Greek warrior to set foot on Trojan soil — and the first to die. An oracle had warned that the first man to land would perish. Protesilaus leapt from his ship regardless and was killed, in most accounts by [Hector](hector.md). His wife Laodamia's devotion to him beyond death became one of the most poignant stories of the [Trojan War](../events/trojan-war.md) cycle.

## In the Iliad

The [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) mentions Protesilaus in the Catalogue of Ships. He led the men of "Phylake and flowery Pyrasos, Demeter's sanctuary, and Iton mother of flocks" — but "now ere this the black earth held him fast. His wife with marred visage was left alone in Phylace, yea, and his bridal chamber half builded; for a Dardanian warrior slew him as he leapt from his ship far first of the Achaians."[^il2-catalogue]

His ship remains a landmark throughout the poem. In Book XIII, when Hector breaks through the wall, the fighting rages "where were the ships of Aias and Protesilaos, drawn up on the beach of the hoary sea, while above the wall was builded lowest."[^il13-ships] In Book XV, fire is thrown on Protesilaus's ship. Hector "seized the stern of a seafaring ship, a fair ship, swift on the brine, that had borne Protesilaos to Troia, but brought him not back again to his own country."[^il15-fire] [Patroclus](patroclus.md)'s first kill in his aristeia comes "by the stern of the ship of great-hearted Protesilaos."[^il16-patroclus]

[^il2-catalogue]: "of all these was warlike Protesilaos leader while yet he lived; but now ere this the black earth held him fast. His wife with marred visage was left alone in Phylake, yea, and his bridal chamber half builded; for a Dardanian warrior slew him as he leapt from his ship far first of the Achaians" (Iliad 2.698-702, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il13-ships]: "where were the ships of Aias and Protesilaos, drawn up on the beach of the hoary sea, while above the wall was builded lowest" (Iliad 13.681-682, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il15-fire]: "Hector seized the stern of a seafaring ship, a fair ship, swift on the brine, that had borne Protesilaos to Troia, but brought him not back again to his own country" (Iliad 15.704-706, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il16-patroclus]: Iliad 16.286-290

## In the Bibliotheca

[Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) lists Protesilaus among the suitors of [Helen](helen.md) and in the catalogue of ships: "From Phylace, Protesilaus, son of Iphiclus: forty ships."[^apd-ships]

At the landing, "of the Greeks the first to land from his ship was Protesilaus, and having slain not a few of the barbarians, he fell by the hand of Hector." His wife Laodamia's grief was extraordinary: "she loved him even after his death, and she made an image of him and consorted with it. The gods had pity on her, and [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md) brought up Protesilaus from Hades. On seeing him, Laodamia thought it was himself returned from Troy, and she was glad; but when he was carried back to Hades, she stabbed herself to death."[^apd-landing]

After his death, [Achilles](achilles.md) took over the assault: "On the death of Protesilaus, Achilles landed with the Myrmidons, and throwing a stone at the head of Cycnus, killed him."[^apd-achilles]

[^apd-ships]: "From Phylace, Protesilaus, son of Iphiclus: forty ships" (Bibliotheca E.3.14, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-landing]: "Of the Greeks the first to land from his ship was Protesilaus, and having slain not a few of the barbarians, he fell by the hand of Hector. His wife Laodamia loved him even after his death, and she made an image of him and consorted with it. The gods had pity on her, and Hermes brought up Protesilaus from Hades. On seeing him, Laodamia thought it was himself returned from Troy, and she was glad; but when he was carried back to Hades, she stabbed herself to death" (Bibliotheca E.3.30, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-achilles]: "On the death of Protesilaus, Achilles landed with the Myrmidons" (Bibliotheca E.3.31, trans. J.G. Frazer)

## In the Fabulae

[Hyginus](../sources/hyginus.md) gives the fullest account of Laodamia's devotion. Protesilaus — called Iolaus, with the name Protesilaus being a posthumous title meaning "first of all to die" — "was first to leap from his ship, and was promptly killed by Hector."[^hyg-death]

"When his wife Laodamia, daughter of Acastus, heard that he had died, she wept and begged the gods that she be allowed to speak with him for three hours. It was granted, and when he was led back by Mercury, she spoke with him for three hours. But when Protesilaus died a second time, Laodamia could not endure her grief."[^hyg-three-hours]

In a separate fable, Hyginus elaborates: "she made a bronze likeness of her husband Protesilaus, put it in her room under pretense of sacred rites, and devoted herself to it." A servant saw her embracing the image and reported it to her father Acastus as a lover. "When he came and burst into the room, he saw the statue of Protesilaus. To put an end to her torture he had the statue and the sacred offerings burned on a pyre he had made, but Laodamia, not enduring her grief, threw herself on it and was burned to death."[^hyg-statue]

[^hyg-death]: "Iolaus, son of Iphiclus and Diomedia, was first to leap from his ship, and was promptly killed by Hector. All called him Protesilaus, since he was the first of all to die" (Fabulae §103, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-three-hours]: "When his wife Laodamia, daughter of Acastus, heard that he had died, she wept and begged the gods that she be allowed to speak with him for three hours. It was granted, and when he was led back by Mercury, she spoke with him for three hours" (Fabulae §103, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-statue]: "she made a bronze likeness of her husband Protesilaus, put it in her room under pretense of sacred rites, and devoted herself to it... To put an end to her torture he had the statue and the sacred offerings burned on a pyre he had made, but Laodamia, not enduring her grief, threw herself on it and was burned to death" (Fabulae §104, trans. Mary Grant)

## In the Achilleid

In Statius's [Achilleid](../sources/achilleid.md), Protesilaus is characterised by his eagerness for war — "for to him was given the keenest desire to fight, and the glory even then of suffering death the first." He rebukes [Calchas](calchas.md), demanding the prophet reveal where [Achilles](achilles.md) is hidden: "O son of Thestor, forgetful of Phoebus and thy own tripods, when wilt thou open thy god-possessed lips more surely?"[^ach-rebuke]

[^ach-rebuke]: "for to him was given the keenest desire to fight, and the glory even then of suffering death the first... O son of Thestor, forgetful of Phoebus and thy own tripods" (Achilleid 1.491-498, trans. J.H. Mozley)
