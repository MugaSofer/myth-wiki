## Overview

**Hippolytus** was the son of [Theseus](theseus.md) by the Amazon queen. He devoted himself exclusively to [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md), goddess of the hunt, and rejected [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md) and all sexual love. In revenge, Aphrodite caused Theseus's wife Phaedra to fall in love with her stepson, setting in motion a chain of events that destroyed Phaedra, Hippolytus, and Theseus's happiness alike. After his death, [Asclepius](../deities/asclepius.md) restored him to life — an act for which [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) struck Asclepius with a thunderbolt. In Italian tradition, Artemis (Diana) hid the resurrected Hippolytus in the grove of Aricia under the name Virbius.

## In Euripides' Hippolytus

Euripides' play (428 BCE) gives the fullest account. [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md) herself delivers the prologue, declaring her motive: Hippolytus "says that I am of deities the vilest, and rejects the bridal bed" while honouring [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md) as the greatest of deities. She has struck Phaedra with love for Hippolytus as the instrument of her revenge.[^eur-prologue]

### The Garland and the Warning

Hippolytus enters singing hymns to Artemis and offers her a garland woven from a pure meadow "where neither does the shepherd think fit to feed his flocks, nor yet came iron there." An attendant warns him not to neglect Aphrodite, but he dismisses the goddess contemptuously.[^eur-garland]

### Phaedra's Confession and Death

Phaedra, wasting with her secret passion, eventually confesses to her Nurse. She places herself in a cursed line of women: "O wretched mother, what a love didst thou love!" (Pasiphae and the bull), "Thou, too, O wretched sister, wife of Bacchus!" ([Ariadne](ariadne.md)), "And I the third, how unhappily I perish!"[^eur-line] The Nurse, hoping to help, reveals the secret to Hippolytus, who responds with a tirade against women. Phaedra, hearing his reaction, hangs herself, leaving a tablet falsely accusing Hippolytus of assault.[^eur-death]

### Theseus's Curse

[Theseus](theseus.md) returns to find Phaedra dead and the accusation. He invokes [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md)'s gift — three curses that cannot fail: "O father Neptune, by one of these three curses, which thou formerly didst promise me, by one of those destroy my son, and let him not escape beyond this day."[^eur-curse]

### The Bull from the Sea

On the shore, as Hippolytus drove his chariot into exile, "a vast wave pillared in heaven" rose from the sea, and "the wave sent forth a bull, a fierce monster; with whose bellowing the whole land filled resounded fearfully." The bull pursued the chariot, the horses panicked, and Hippolytus was entangled in the reins and dragged to death.[^eur-bull]

### Artemis's Revelation

[Artemis](../deities/artemis.md) appears to reveal the truth and explain the divine law that prevents gods from opposing one another: "None wishes to thwart the purpose of him that wills anything; but we always stand aloof." She promises to avenge Hippolytus by destroying one of Aphrodite's favourites: "with these inevitable weapons from mine own hand will I revenge me on another, whoever to her be the dearest of mortals." She also institutes a cult in his honour: "the unwedded virgins before their nuptials shall shear their locks to thee for many an age."[^eur-artemis]

The dying Hippolytus recognises Artemis by her divine perfume. He delivers his summary of the tragedy — "One Venus hath destroyed us three" — and at Artemis's urging forgives his father before dying.[^eur-forgive]

## In the Bibliotheca

[Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) gives a concise account. [Theseus](theseus.md) "had a son Hippolytus by the Amazon." Phaedra, daughter of [Minos](minos.md), "fell in love with the son he had by the Amazon, to wit, Hippolytus, and besought him to lie with her. Howbeit, he fled from her embraces, because he hated all women." Phaedra then "cleft open the doors of her bed-chamber, rent her garments, and falsely charged Hippolytus with an assault."[^apd-phaedra]

"Theseus believed her and prayed to Poseidon that Hippolytus might perish. So, when Hippolytus was riding in his chariot and driving beside the sea, Poseidon sent up a bull from the surf, and the horses were frightened, the chariot dashed in pieces, and Hippolytus, entangled in the reins, was dragged to death. And when her passion was made public, Phaedra hanged herself."[^apd-death]

Separately, Apollodorus lists Hippolytus among those raised from the dead by [Asclepius](../deities/asclepius.md): "Hippolytus, as the author of the Naupactica reports."[^apd-raised]

[^apd-phaedra]: "Phaedra, after she had borne two children, Acamas and Demophon, to Theseus, fell in love with the son he had by the Amazon, to wit, Hippolytus, and besought him to lie with her. Howbeit, he fled from her embraces, because he hated all women. But Phaedra, fearing that he might accuse her to his father, cleft open the doors of her bed-chamber, rent her garments, and falsely charged Hippolytus with an assault" (Bibliotheca E.1.18, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-death]: "Theseus believed her and prayed to Poseidon that Hippolytus might perish. So, when Hippolytus was riding in his chariot and driving beside the sea, Poseidon sent up a bull from the surf, and the horses were frightened, the chariot dashed in pieces, and Hippolytus, entangled in the reins, was dragged to death. And when her passion was made public, Phaedra hanged herself" (Bibliotheca E.1.19, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-raised]: "Hippolytus, as the author of the Naupactica reports" (Bibliotheca 3.10.3, trans. J.G. Frazer)

## In the Fabulae

[Hyginus](../sources/hyginus.md) lists Hippolytus among those restored to life by [Asclepius](../deities/asclepius.md): "Aesculapius, son of Apollo, is said to have restored life either to Glaucus, son of Minos, or to Hippolytus, and Jupiter because of this struck him with a thunderbolt."[^hyg-raised]

[^hyg-raised]: "Aesculapius, son of Apollo, is said to have restored life either to Glaucus, son of Minos, or to Hippolytus, and Jupiter because of this struck him with a thunderbolt" (Fabulae §49, trans. Mary Grant)

## In the Aeneid

[Virgil](../sources/aeneid.md) gives the Italian sequel. After Hippolytus "fell by his stepmother's treachery, torn asunder by his frightened horses to fulfil a father's revenge," he "came again to the daylight and heaven's upper air, recalled by Diana's love and the drugs of the Healer." [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md), indignant that any mortal should rise from the dead, "launched his thunder and hurled down to the Stygian water the Phoebus-born, the discoverer of such craft and cure."[^aen-revival]

But [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md) (Trivia) "hides Hippolytus in a secret habitation, and sends him away to the nymph Egeria and the woodland's keeping, where, solitary in Italian forests, he should spend an inglorious life, and have Virbius for his altered name." As a result, "hoofed horses are kept away from Trivia's temple and consecrated groves, because, affrighted at the portents of the sea, they overset the chariot and flung him out upon the shore."[^aen-virbius]

[^aen-revival]: "Hippolytus, after he fell by his stepmother's treachery, torn asunder by his frightened horses to fulfil a father's revenge, came again to the daylight and heaven's upper air, recalled by Diana's love and the drugs of the Healer" (Aeneid 7.765-773, trans. J.W. Mackail)
[^aen-virbius]: "Trivia the bountiful hides Hippolytus in a secret habitation, and sends him away to the nymph Egeria and the woodland's keeping, where, solitary in Italian forests, he should spend an inglorious life, and have Virbius for his altered name" (Aeneid 7.774-780, trans. J.W. Mackail)

## In the Metamorphoses

[Ovid](../sources/metamorphoses.md) has Hippolytus (now Virbius) tell his own story. He recounts his death: "one Hippolytus met with his death through the credulity of his loved sire, deceived by a stepmother's wicked art." After [Asclepius](../deities/asclepius.md) restored him, [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md) (Diana) ordered him to take a new name: "You were Hippolytus, but now instead you shall be Virbius." He dwells in her sacred grove as "one of the lesser gods."[^met-virbius]
