## Overview

**Neoptolemos** was the son of [Achilles](achilles.md) and Deidamia, conceived while Achilles was disguised as a girl on the island of Scyros. He was summoned to [Troy](../places/troy.md) after his father's death because an oracle declared the city could not be taken without him. At Troy he slew Eurypylus and [Priam](priam.md), and was awarded Andromache as his prize. After the war he settled in Molossia, where he ruled as king. He was killed at [Delphi](../places/delphi.md), though the sources disagree on the circumstances.

## In the [Epic Cycle](../sources/epic-cycle.md)

### Ghost of Achilles (Little Iliad)

After the fall of Troy, the ghost of [Achilles](achilles.md) appeared to Neoptolemos.[^ec-ghost]

### Astyanax's Death (Little Iliad)

Neoptolemos killed Hector's infant son: he "snatched him from the bosom of his rich-haired nurse and seized him by the foot and cast him from a tower."[^ec-astyanax]

### Aeneas Taken Captive (Little Iliad)

Neoptolemos "put Aeneas, the famous son of horse-taming Anchises, on board his sea-faring ships, a prize surpassing those of all the Danaans."[^ec-aeneas]

### Journey Home (Returns)

Warned by [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md), Neoptolemos journeyed overland rather than by sea, avoiding the storm that wrecked many of the Greek fleet. He buried Phoenix along the way and was recognized by [Peleus](peleus.md) among the Molossi.[^ec-returns]

## In the [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md)

### Birth (3.13.8)

When [Achilles](achilles.md) was nine, Calchas declared Troy could not be taken without him. [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md) disguised him in female garb and entrusted him to Lycomedes on Scyros, where "Achilles had an intrigue with Deidamia, daughter of Lycomedes, and a son Pyrrhus was born to him, who was afterwards called Neoptolemus."[^apd-birth]

### Summoned to Troy (E.5.10-11)

After Achilles' death, Helenus was forced to reveal how Ilium could be taken: among the conditions, "Neoptolemus fought for them." The Greeks "sent Ulysses and Phoenix to Lycomedes at Scyros, and these two persuaded him to let Neoptolemus go. On coming to the camp and receiving his father's arms from Ulysses, who willingly resigned them, Neoptolemus slew many of the Trojans."[^apd-summon]

### Slaying Eurypylus (E.5.12)

"Eurypylus, son of Telephus, arrived to fight for the Trojans, bringing a great force of Mysians. He performed doughty deeds, but was slain by Neoptolemus."[^apd-eurypylus]

### Sack of Troy (E.5.21-23)

"Neoptolemus slew Priam, who had taken refuge at the altar of Zeus of the Courtyard."[^apd-priam] After the sack, "Neoptolemus got Andromache" as his special award among the captive women.[^apd-andromache]

### After the War (E.6.5, E.6.12-14)

[Thetis](../deities/thetis.md) persuaded Neoptolemos "to wait two days and to offer sacrifice" before sailing, sparing him the storm that wrecked the other Greeks.[^apd-thetis] He then "set out for the country of the Molossians by land with Helenus, and on the way Phoenix died, and Neoptolemus buried him; and having vanquished the Molossians in battle he reigned as king and begat Molossus on Andromache."[^apd-molossia]

He gave Helenus his mother Deidamia as wife, and "when Peleus was expelled from Phthia by the sons of Acastus and died, Neoptolemus succeeded to his father's kingdom."[^apd-peleus]

### Death at Delphi (E.6.14)

"When Orestes went mad, Neoptolemus carried off his wife Hermione, who had previously been betrothed to him in Troy; and for that reason he was slain by Orestes at Delphi."[^apd-death] An alternative tradition holds "that he went to Delphi to demand satisfaction from Apollo for the death of his father, and that he rifled the votive offerings and set fire to the temple, and was on that account slain by Machaereus the Delphian."[^apd-death-alt]

### Judge of Odysseus (E.7.40)

In one tradition, the kinfolk of Penelope's slain suitors "submitted the case to the judgment of Neoptolemus, king of the islands off Epirus; that Neoptolemus, thinking to get possession of Cephallenia if once Ulysses were put out of the way, condemned him to exile."[^apd-judge]

## In the [Fabulae](../sources/hyginus.md)

### Birth and Name (§96-97)

Hyginus records the name Pyrrhus as deriving from Achilles' disguise: the girls at Lycomedes' court "called him Pyrrha, since he had tawny hair, and in Greek a redhead is called pyrrhos."[^hyg-name] In the catalogue of ships, Neoptolemos is listed as "son of Achilles and Deidamia, from the island of Scyros; he was called Pyrrhus from his father who was disguised as the girl Pyrrha."[^hyg-ships]

### At Troy (§108, §112-114)

Neoptolemos was among those who hid within the Wooden Horse.[^hyg-horse] He killed Eurypylus in combat and [Priam](priam.md) personally, and is credited with slaying six Trojans in all.[^hyg-kills]

### Death (§123)

"Neoptolemus, son of Achilles and Deidamia, begat Amphialus by captive Andromache, daughter of Eetion." He went to Lacedaemon to claim Hermione, his betrothed, who had been given to [Orestes](orestes.md) in marriage. "Menelaus did not wish to go back on his word, and took Hermione from Orestes and gave her to Neoptolemus. Orestes, thus insulted, slew Neoptolemus as he was sacrificing to Delphi. The bones of Neoptolemus were scattered through the land of Ambracia, which is in the district of Epirus."[^hyg-death]

### Attack on Harpalycus (§193)

"When Neoptolemus, returning from Troy, attacked Harpalycus and wounded him severely," the warrior-maiden Harpalyce "saved her father from death by making an attack and putting the enemy to flight."[^hyg-harpalycus]

[^hyg-name]: "The girls called him Pyrrha, since he had tawny hair, and in Greek a redhead is called pyrrhos" (Fabulae §96, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-ships]: "Neoptolemus, son of Achilles and Deidamia, from the island of Scyros; he was called Pyrrhus from his father who was disguised as the girl Pyrrha" (Fabulae §97)
[^hyg-horse]: "in it were gathered Menelaus, Ulysses, Diomedes, Thessander, Sthenelus, Acamas, Thoas, Machaon, Neoptolemus" (Fabulae §108)
[^hyg-kills]: "Neoptolemus, Priam" (Fabulae §113); "Neoptolemus, 6" (Fabulae §114)
[^hyg-death]: "Orestes, thus insulted, slew Neoptolemus as he was sacrificing to Delphi. The bones of Neoptolemus were scattered through the land of Ambracia, which is in the district of Epirus" (Fabulae §123)
[^hyg-harpalycus]: "When Neoptolemus, returning from Troy, attacked Harpalycus and wounded him severely, she saved her father from death by making an attack and putting the enemy to flight" (Fabulae §193)

## In [Pindar](../sources/pindar.md)

### Troy and Homecoming (Nemean VII)

Pindar records that Neoptolemos "sacked the city of Priam where the Danaoi toiled with him."[^pin-sack] After the war he did not return to Scyros: "He sailing thence missed Skyros, and they wandered till they came to Ephyra, and in Molossia he was king for a little while: howbeit his race held this state continually."[^pin-molossia]

### Death at Delphi (Nemean VII)

Neoptolemos went to Delphi carrying spoils from Troy, and there met his end: "in quarrel concerning meats a man smote him with a knife."[^pin-death] But Pindar frames this death as divinely ordained rather than shameful: "it was needful that in that most ancient grove someone of the lords the sons of Aiakos should abide within thenceforward, beside the goodly walls of the god's house, and that when with plenteous sacrifice the processions do honour to the heroes, he should keep watch that fair right be done."[^pin-fate]

Neoptolemos thus became a presiding spirit at Delphi: "Three words shall be enough: when he presideth over the games there is no lie found in his testimony thereof."[^pin-games]

Pindar closes the ode by insisting on his respect for the hero: "Never shall my heart confess that I have outraged Neoptolemos with irreclaimable words."[^pin-defense]

### Epirus and Descendants (Nemean VII, Olympian VIII)

Neoptolemos's realm in Epirus, where "his race held this state continually," gave rise to the Molossian dynasty. Pyrrhos, the later invader of Italy, claimed descent from him (Neoptolemos was also called Pyrrhos).[^pin-molossia] In Nemean V, Neoptolemos is placed in "wide Epeiros, where cattle-pasturing headlands, from Dodona onwards, slope forward to the Ionian Sea."[^pin-nem5]

In Olympian VIII, Apollo prophesied that Troy would fall "with the first and fourth" of [Aiakos](aeacus.md)'s line — Telamon with [Heracles](heracles.md), and Neoptolemos in the Wooden Horse.[^pin-ol8]

[^pin-sack]: "beneath the floor of Pytho lieth Neoptolemos, dying there when he had sacked the city of Priam where the Danaoi toiled with him" (Pindar, Nemean VII, trans. Ernest Myers)
[^pin-molossia]: "He sailing thence missed Skyros, and they wandered till they came to Ephyra, and in Molossia he was king for a little while: howbeit his race held this state continually" (Pindar, Nemean VII)
[^pin-death]: "there in quarrel concerning meats a man smote him with a knife" (Pindar, Nemean VII)
[^pin-fate]: "it was needful that in that most ancient grove someone of the lords the sons of Aiakos should abide within thenceforward, beside the goodly walls of the god's house, and that when with plenteous sacrifice the processions do honour to the heroes, he should keep watch that fair right be done" (Pindar, Nemean VII)
[^pin-games]: "Three words shall be enough: when he presideth over the games there is no lie found in his testimony thereof" (Pindar, Nemean VII)
[^pin-defense]: "Never shall my heart confess that I have outraged Neoptolemos with irreclaimable words" (Pindar, Nemean VII)
[^pin-nem5]: "Neoptolemos in wide Epeiros, where cattle-pasturing headlands, from Dodona onwards, slope forward to the Ionian Sea" (Pindar, Nemean V)
[^pin-ol8]: Olympian VIII; footnote: "Achilles' son, Neoptolemos, who succeeded" — "the third typifies Achilles' son, Neoptolemos, who was in the Wooden Horse" (Pindar, Olympian VIII)

## In the [Aeneid](../sources/aeneid.md)

### Slaying of Priam (Book II)

Neoptolemos (called Pyrrhus) killed [Priam](priam.md)'s son Polites before the king's eyes, then dragged the aged king to his own altar. Priam rebuked him: "not such to a foe was the Achilles whose parentage thou beliest; but he revered a suppliant's right and trust."[^aen-rebuke] Pyrrhus dragged him "quivering to the very altar, slipping in the pool of his child's blood, and wound his left hand in his hair, while in his right the sword flashed out and plunged to the hilt in his side."[^aen-kill]

[^aen-rebuke]: "not such to a foe was the Achilles whose parentage thou beliest; but he revered a suppliant's right and trust, restored to the tomb Hector's pallid corpse, and sent me back to my realm" (Aeneid II, trans. J.W. Mackail)
[^aen-kill]: "wound his left hand in his hair, while in his right the sword flashed out and plunged to the hilt in his side" (Aeneid II)

## Variant Traditions

The circumstances of Neoptolemos's death at Delphi vary across sources:

- **Pindar** (Nemean VII): Killed "in quarrel concerning meats" by "a man" with a knife; his death was fated so that an Aiakid prince would preside over the sanctuary forever.
- **Apollodorus** (E.6.14): Slain by [Orestes](orestes.md) in revenge for carrying off Hermione. Alternatively, killed by the Delphian Machaereus after rifling votive offerings and burning the temple.
- **Hyginus** (§123): Slain by Orestes "as he was sacrificing to Delphi" over the Hermione dispute. His bones were scattered through Ambracia.

The sources also differ on his son by Andromache — Apollodorus names the child Molossus (E.6.12), while Hyginus names him Amphialus (§123).
