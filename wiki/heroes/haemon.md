## Overview

**Haemon** was the son of [Creon](../heroes/creon.md) and [Eurydice](../heroes/eurydice-creon.md), and betrothed to [Antigone](../heroes/antigone.md). In Sophocles' Antigone he confronts his father with measured argument and mounting passion, warning that the people mourn Antigone's fate and that Creon's rigidity will destroy him. When he finds Antigone dead in the tomb, he tries to kill his father, fails, and turns his sword on himself.

## In the Bibliotheca

The Bibliotheca records a Haemon who was son of [Creon](../heroes/creon.md) and was "devoured by the [Sphinx](../creatures/sphinx.md)" before Oedipus arrived to solve her riddle.[^apd-haemon] This is presented as a separate incident preceding the events of the Oedipus story; Creon's proclamation offering the kingdom to whoever solved the riddle followed Haemon's death.

This is either a variant tradition presenting a different figure with the same name, or the same son counted as surviving — the Bibliotheca does not resolve the tension.

## In Sophocles' Antigone

Haemon enters after his father has condemned Antigone to death. He opens with deference: "O father, I am thine, and I will take / Thy wisdom as the helm to steer withal."[^sa-opening] He does not immediately challenge Creon but reports what he has heard from the people: "The commons stand in terror of thy frown, / And dare not utter aught that might offend, / But I can overhear their muttered plaints, / Know how the people mourn this maiden doomed / For noblest deeds to die the worst of deaths."[^sa-people]

He argues for flexibility with a series of images: "See how the trees beside a stream in flood / Save, if they yield to force, each spray unharmed, / But by resisting perish root and branch."[^sa-trees] When Creon refuses to listen and accuses him of championing a woman, the argument grows heated. Creon declares: "Living the maid shall never be thy bride." Haemon's reply is quiet and final: "So she shall die, but one will die with her."[^sa-threat] He storms out saying his father will never see his face again.

After Creon relents too late, a messenger reports what happened at the tomb. Creon found Antigone hanging in the cave with Haemon "clasping her cold form, / Her lover lay bewailing his dead bride / Death-wedded, and his father's cruelty."[^sa-tomb] When Creon entered and called to him, Haemon "glared at him with tiger eyes, / Spat in his face, and then, without a word, / Drew his two-hilted sword and smote, but missed / His father flying backwards. Then the boy, / Wroth with himself, poor wretch, incontinent / Fell on his sword and drove it through his side / Home."[^sa-death] He died with his arms around Antigone, "her pallid cheek incarnadined / With his expiring gasps."

## Variant Traditions

Hyginus (Fabulae §72) gives a different version: Creon gives Antigone to Haemon to execute, but Haemon secretly entrusts her to shepherds, and she bears him a son. When the son later comes to Thebes and is recognized by Creon through a birthmark (a mark shared by all descendants of the Sown Men), Heracles intercedes but Creon remains inflexible. In Hyginus's version, "Haemon killed himself and his wife Antigone."[^hyg-variant]
