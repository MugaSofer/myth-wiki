## Overview

**Memnon** was king of the Aethiopians, son of [Eos](../deities/eos.md) (Dawn) and Tithonus. He came to [Troy](../places/troy.md) as an ally of [Priam](priam.md) after [Penthesilea](penthesilea.md)'s death, leading a vast host. He killed [Antilochus](antilochus.md), son of [Nestor](nestor.md), and fought a titanic duel with [Achilles](achilles.md) in which both heroes — each of divine parentage, each bearing armour forged by [Hephaestus](../deities/hephaestus.md) — were elevated by [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) to superhuman power. The Fates appeared beside them, one dark for Memnon, one bright for Achilles, and Achilles killed him. His mother Dawn mourned so bitterly she threatened to stop bringing light to the world; his Aethiopian followers were transformed into birds.

## In the Posthomerica

### Arrival at Troy

After Penthesilea's death, the Trojans despaired. Old Thymoetes urged flight; Polydamas counselled returning [Helen](helen.md) and paying double restitution; [Paris](paris.md) furiously rejected this as cowardice. [Priam](priam.md) urged waiting for Memnon, and the king soon arrived with "a countless host of swarthy Aethiops." The Trojans "joyed to gaze on him, as seafarers, with ruining tempest utterly forspent, see through wide-parting clouds the radiance of the eternal-wheeling Northern Wain."[^post-arrival]

At the feast, Priam pledged Memnon with a golden cup — an heirloom "a gift of Gods; for this the cunning God-smith brought to Zeus, his masterpiece, what time the Mighty in Power to Hephaestus gave for bride the Cyprian Queen," passed down through Dardanus, Erichthonius, Tros, Ilus, and Laomedon.[^post-cup] Memnon was modest at the feast: "Beseems not with great swelling words to vaunt amidst the feast, and lavish promises, but rather quietly to eat in hall, and to devise deeds worthy."[^post-modest]

[^post-arrival]: "From all the streets of Troy the Trojans flocked glad-eyed to gaze on him, as seafarers, with ruining tempest utterly forspent, see through wide-parting clouds the radiance of the eternal-wheeling Northern Wain" (Posthomerica 2.1555-1559, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post-cup]: "this the cunning God-smith brought to Zeus, his masterpiece, what time the Mighty in Power to Hephaestus gave for bride the Cyprian Queen; and Zeus on Dardanus his godlike son bestowed it" (Posthomerica 2.1605-1608, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post-modest]: "Beseems not with great swelling words to vaunt amidst the feast, and lavish promises, but rather quietly to eat in hall, and to devise deeds worthy. Whether I be brave and strong, or whether I be not, battle, wherein a man's true might is seen, shall prove to thee" (Posthomerica 2.1619-1625, trans. A.S. Way)

### Zeus Warns the Gods

On Olympus, Zeus warned the gods: "Be it known unto you all, to-morn shall bring by yonder war affliction swift and sore... Let none clasp my knees in prayer, since even to us relentless are the fates."[^post-zeus-warning]

[^post-zeus-warning]: "Be it known unto you all, to-morn shall bring by yonder war affliction swift and sore... Let none clasp my knees in prayer, since even to us relentless are the fates" (Posthomerica 2.1646-1653, trans. A.S. Way)

### The Killing of Antilochus

In battle, Memnon cut down many Greeks. He fought against [Antilochus](antilochus.md), who tried to strike him with a stone but merely dented his helm. Memnon's fury grew "like seething cauldron" and "he stabbed, for all his cunning of fence, the son of Nestor above the breast; the crashing spear plunged to the heart, the spot of speediest death."[^post-antilochus]

[Nestor](nestor.md) cried for his son Thrasymedes to help recover the body. When Nestor himself confronted Memnon, the warrior-king spared him: "Ancient, it were my shame to fight with one so much mine elder: I am not blind unto honour." He urged Nestor to withdraw "lest, how loth soe'er, I smite thee of sore need."[^post-nestor] Nestor replied that in his youth, Memnon would not have prevailed: "If in my strength of youth thou hadst met me—ha, thy friends had not rejoiced, for all thy might!"[^post-nestor-reply]

[^post-antilochus]: "he stabbed, for all his cunning of fence, the son of Nestor above the breast; the crashing spear plunged to the heart, the spot of speediest death" (Posthomerica 2.1764-1766, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post-nestor]: "Ancient, it were my shame to fight with one so much mine elder: I am not blind unto honour... Nay, draw thou back afar from battle-toil and bitter death" (Posthomerica 2.1828-1835, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post-nestor-reply]: "If in my strength of youth thou hadst met me—ha, thy friends had not rejoiced, for all thy might! But me the grievous weight of age bows down, like an old lion whom a cur may boldly drive back from the fold" (Posthomerica 2.1850-1856, trans. A.S. Way)

### Duel with Achilles

Nestor summoned [Achilles](achilles.md), who came face to face with Memnon. The two exchanged boasts about their divine mothers. Memnon taunted: "Of birth divine am I, the Dawn-queen's mighty son... my goddess-mother doth transcend a Nereid, whose child thou vauntest thee. To Gods and men my mother bringeth light... But thine—she sits in barren crypts of brine: she dwells glorying mid dumb sea-monsters and mid fish."[^post-memnon-boast]

Achilles responded by defending [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md): she had sheltered [Dionysus](../deities/dionysus.md) when chased by Lycurgus, welcomed [Hephaestus](../deities/hephaestus.md) when he fell from heaven, and once freed [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) from bonds. He concluded: "But why like witless children stand we here babbling our parents' fame and our own deeds? Now is the hour when prowess shall decide."[^post-achilles-boast]

They fought with swords, "and rained the never-ceasing blows upon the bucklers which with craft divine Hephaestus' self had fashioned." Zeus "loved them both" and "inspired with prowess each, and mightier than their wont he made them, made them tireless, nothing like to men, but Gods."[^post-duel] The earth quaked, the heavens thundered, the sea roared. The Nereids thronged around Thetis in fear; Dawn trembled for her son in her chariot.

Then "the twin Fates suddenly stood beside these twain, one dark—her shadow fell on Memnon's heart; one bright—her radiance haloed Peleus' son." Achilles drove his sword "beneath the breast-bone" of Memnon: "clear through his body all the dark-blue blade leapt: suddenly snapped the silver cord of life."[^post-memnon-death]

[^post-memnon-boast]: "Of birth divine am I, the Dawn-queen's mighty son, nurtured afar by lily-slender Hesperid Maids, beside the Ocean-river... To Gods and men my mother bringeth light... But thine—she sits in barren crypts of brine" (Posthomerica 2.1958-1971, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post-achilles-boast]: "From supremest Zeus I trace my glorious birth; and from the strong Sea-god Nereus... she sheltered Dionysus, chased by might of murderous Lycurgus from the earth. Yea, and the cunning God-smith welcomed she within her mansion, when from heaven he fell. Ay, and the Lightning-lord she once released from bonds" (Posthomerica 2.1978-1999, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post-duel]: "rained the never-ceasing blows upon the bucklers which with craft divine Hephaestus' self had fashioned... Zeus, for that he loved them both, inspired with prowess each, and mightier than their wont he made them, made them tireless, nothing like to men, but Gods" (Posthomerica 2.2003-2011, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post-memnon-death]: "the twin Fates suddenly stood beside these twain, one dark—her shadow fell on Memnon's heart; one bright—her radiance haloed Peleus' son... Beneath the breast-bone then of godlike Memnon plunged Achilles' sword; clear through his body all the dark-blue blade leapt: suddenly snapped the silver cord of life" (Posthomerica 2.2071-2115, trans. A.S. Way)

### The Mourning of Dawn

The Winds (called "the Breathings of the Dawn") carried Memnon's body to the stream of Aesopus, where nymphs planted a grove around his barrow. Blood drops that fell from his wounds became a river called Paphlagoneion, whose waters "once a year they turn to blood, when comes the woeful day whereon died Memnon."[^post-river]

[Eos](../deities/eos.md) descended with the twelve [Horae](../deities/groups/horae.md) and the Pleiads. She threatened to plunge "down to the dread depths of the underworld" and "to blind night leave earth, sky, and sea, till Chaos and formless darkness brood o'er all." She challenged: "Let him bring up to Olympus Thetis from the sea to hold for him light forth to Gods and men!"[^post-eos-lament] Zeus thundered to compel her return.

The Aethiopians were transformed into birds ("the Memnons") "that still do the tribes of men call... and still with wailing cries they dart and wheel above their king's tomb, and they scatter dust down on his grave, still shrill the battle-cry, in memory of Memnon."[^post-memnons-birds] Memnon himself either dwells in Hades or "amid the Blessed on the Elysian Plain."

Dawn "heavenward soared with the all-fostering Hours, who drew her to Zeus' threshold, sorely loth, yet conquered by their gentle pleadings."[^post-eos-return]

[^post-river]: "once a year they turn to blood, when comes the woeful day whereon died Memnon. Thence a sick and choking reek steams" (Posthomerica 2.2139-2143, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post-eos-lament]: "I will plunge down to the dread depths of the underworld... and will to blind night leave earth, sky, and sea, till Chaos and formless darkness brood o'er all... Let him bring up to Olympus Thetis from the sea to hold for him light forth to Gods and men!" (Posthomerica 2.2197-2210, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post-memnons-birds]: "still do the tribes of men 'The Memnons' call; and still with wailing cries they dart and wheel above their king's tomb, and they scatter dust down on his grave, still shrill the battle-cry, in memory of Memnon, each to each" (Posthomerica 2.2245-2249, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post-eos-return]: "heavenward soared with the all-fostering Hours, who drew her to Zeus' threshold, sorely loth, yet conquered by their gentle pleadings, such as salve the bitterest grief of broken hearts" (Posthomerica 2.2260-2263, trans. A.S. Way)

## In Other Sources

The [Epic Cycle](../sources/epic-cycle.md) (Aethiopis) gives the earliest account: "Memnon, the son of Eos, wearing armour made by Hephaestus, comes to help the Trojans." He kills Antilochus, is slain by Achilles, and "Eos then obtains of Zeus and bestows upon her son immortality."[^ec-memnon]

In [Ovid](../sources/metamorphoses.md)'s version, Aurora saw her son "perish by Achilles' deadly spear, upon the Phrygian plain. She saw his death, and the loved rose that lights the dawning hour turned death-pale, and the sky was veiled in clouds." She begged Zeus for some honour; from Memnon's pyre-ashes, birds were formed (the Memnonides) that divided into two groups and fought each other annually. Aurora's permanent grief manifests as the morning dew.[^met-memnon]

[Pindar](../sources/pindar.md) (Nemean VI) records that Achilles slew Memnon.[^pindar-memnon]

[^ec-memnon]: "Memnon, the son of Eos, wearing armour made by Hephaestus, comes to help the Trojans... Eos then obtains of Zeus and bestows upon her son immortality" (Aethiopis, summary by Proclus, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^met-memnon]: Metamorphoses 13.576-622
[^pindar-memnon]: Nemean Ode VI

## Variant Traditions

The Posthomerica and the Epic Cycle agree on the basic narrative: Memnon comes to Troy, kills Antilochus, duels Achilles, and dies. However, they differ on the aftermath. In the Aethiopis, Eos obtains immortality for Memnon from Zeus. In the Posthomerica, no immortality is explicitly granted; instead, his followers are turned into birds and his blood becomes a river, while Memnon himself may dwell either in Hades or on the Elysian Plain. In Ovid, the transformation into birds occurs from Memnon's funeral pyre, not from living followers.

The Posthomerica is unique in providing the extended details of Memnon's modest character at the feast, his chivalrous treatment of old Nestor, and the cosmic scope of the duel (with Zeus empowering both fighters and the twin Fates appearing visibly).
