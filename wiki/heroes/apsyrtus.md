## Overview

**Apsyrtus** was the son of King [Aeetes](aeetes.md) of [Colchis](../places/colchis.md) and the half-brother of [Medea](medea.md). He led the Colchian pursuit fleet after Medea fled with [Jason](jason.md) and the [Golden Fleece](../objects/golden-fleece.md), and was treacherously murdered by Jason on an island of [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md) in the Ister (Danube), lured there by Medea's false promises.

### Background

Apsyrtus was the son of Aeetes by a woman other than his queen: "in another dwelt Apsyrtus, son of Aeetes, whom a Caucasian nymph, Asterodeia, bare before he made Eidyia his wedded wife, the youngest daughter of [Tethys](../deities/tethys.md) and [Oceanus](../deities/oceanus.md)."[^arg3-birth] He bore a nickname from the Colchians: "the sons of the Colchians called him by the new name of Phaethon, because he outshone all the youths."[^arg3-phaethon]

[^arg3-birth]: "in another dwelt Apsyrtus, son of Aeetes, whom a Caucasian nymph, Asterodeia, bare before he made Eidyia his wedded wife, the youngest daughter of Tethys and Oceanus" (Argonautica 3.240-242, trans. R.C. Seaton)
[^arg3-phaethon]: "the sons of the Colchians called him by the new name of Phaethon, because he outshone all the youths" (Argonautica 3.243-244)

### The Pursuit

When Medea's flight became known, Aeetes mustered the Colchians to pursue: "in his shapely chariot Aeetes shone forth above all with his steeds, the gift of [Helios](../deities/helius.md), swift as the blasts of the wind... And Apsyrtus held in his hands the reins of the steeds."[^arg4-chariot] Apsyrtus led a division of the Colchian fleet up the Ister, outstripping the Argonauts by taking a different branch of the river to cut them off: "Apsyrtus led, and, turning aside, he entered the mouth called Fair. Wherefore he outstripped the heroes by crossing a neck of land into the furthest gulf of the Ionian sea."[^arg4-outstrip]

He stationed Colchians on islands throughout the river "as far as the river Salangon and the Nestian land," barring every route to the sea.[^arg4-stations]

[^arg4-chariot]: "in his shapely chariot Aeetes shone forth above all with his steeds, the gift of Helios, swift as the blasts of the wind... And Apsyrtus held in his hands the reins of the steeds" (Argonautica 4.217-222)
[^arg4-outstrip]: "Apsyrtus led, and, turning aside, he entered the mouth called Fair. Wherefore he outstripped the heroes by crossing a neck of land into the furthest gulf of the Ionian sea" (Argonautica 4.305-309)
[^arg4-stations]: "on other islands too, close by, Apsyrtus left his host as far as the river Salangon and the Nestian land" (Argonautica 4.333-334)

### The Truce and the Trap

Outnumbered, the Argonauts made a covenant with Apsyrtus: the fleece was justly won, but Medea's fate would be decided by a neutral king. Medea, furious at being handed over, reminded Jason of his oaths and cursed him: "Whither are fled the oaths by Zeus the suppliants' god, whither are fled thy honied promises?"[^arg4-oaths] She then proposed the murder plot: "I will beguile Apsyrtus to come into thy hands... Thereupon if this deed pleases thee, slay him and raise a conflict with the Colchians, I care not."[^arg4-plot]

[^arg4-oaths]: "Whither are fled the oaths by Zeus the suppliants' god, whither are fled thy honied promises?" (Argonautica 4.358-359)
[^arg4-plot]: "I will beguile Apsyrtus to come into thy hands... Thereupon if this deed pleases thee, slay him and raise a conflict with the Colchians, I care not" (Argonautica 4.415-419)

### The Murder

Medea lured Apsyrtus to the sacred island of Artemis on the Brygean isles, pretending she wanted to conspire with him against the strangers. Among the gifts sent to draw him was a sacred crimson robe of Hypsipyle, originally made by the Graces for [Dionysus](../deities/dionysus.md). Apsyrtus came alone to the island at night: "he, beguiled by these dire promises, swiftly crossed the swell of the sea in his ship, and in dark night set foot on the sacred island; and faring all alone to meet her he made trial in speech of his sister, as a tender child tries a wintry torrent which not even strong men can pass through."[^arg4-approach]

Jason struck from ambush: "the maiden turned her eyes aside and covered them with her veil that she might not see the blood of her brother when he was smitten. And Jason marked him and struck him down, as a butcher strikes down a mighty strong-horned bull."[^arg4-strike] In death, "the hero breathing out his life caught up in both hands the dark blood as it welled from the wound; and he dyed with red his sister's silvery veil and robe as she shrank away."[^arg4-death]

Jason performed a ritual of atonement over the body: "the hero, Aeson's son, cut off the extremities of the dead man, and thrice licked up some blood and thrice spat the pollution from his teeth, as it is right for the slayer to do, to atone for a treacherous murder."[^arg4-ritual] The body was hidden in the ground "where even now those bones lie among the Apsyrtians."[^arg4-burial]

The Fury witnessed the killing: "with swift side-glance the irresistible pitiless Fury beheld the deadly deed they had done."[^arg4-fury]

[^arg4-approach]: "he, beguiled by these dire promises, swiftly crossed the swell of the sea in his ship, and in dark night set foot on the sacred island; and faring all alone to meet her he made trial in speech of his sister, as a tender child tries a wintry torrent which not even strong men can pass through" (Argonautica 4.457-462)
[^arg4-strike]: "the maiden turned her eyes aside and covered them with her veil that she might not see the blood of her brother when he was smitten. And Jason marked him and struck him down, as a butcher strikes down a mighty strong-horned bull" (Argonautica 4.465-469)
[^arg4-death]: "the hero breathing out his life caught up in both hands the dark blood as it welled from the wound; and he dyed with red his sister's silvery veil and robe as she shrank away" (Argonautica 4.471-474)
[^arg4-ritual]: "the hero, Aeson's son, cut off the extremities of the dead man, and thrice licked up some blood and thrice spat the pollution from his teeth, as it is right for the slayer to do, to atone for a treacherous murder" (Argonautica 4.476-479)
[^arg4-burial]: "the clammy corpse he hid in the ground where even now those bones lie among the Apsyrtians" (Argonautica 4.479-481)
[^arg4-fury]: "with swift side-glance the irresistible pitiless Fury beheld the deadly deed they had done" (Argonautica 4.474-475)

### Aftermath

With Apsyrtus dead, Peleus advised the Argonauts to flee at once: "as people bereft of their king, they will be scattered in grievous dissension."[^arg4-peleus] The Colchians indeed scattered, settling throughout the region: "some set foot on those very islands where the heroes had stayed, and they still dwell there, bearing a name derived from Apsyrtus; and others built a fenced city by the dark deep Illyrian river."[^arg4-scatter] [Hera](../deities/hera.md) prevented further pursuit with "terrible lightnings from the sky," and the Colchians, fearing Aeetes' wrath, never returned home.[^arg4-hera]

The murder provoked [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md)'s anger, and the speaking beam of the [Argo](../objects/argo.md) proclaimed that the heroes must be purified by [Circe](../deities/circe.md) before they could return home.

[^arg4-peleus]: "as people bereft of their king, they will be scattered in grievous dissension" (Argonautica 4.500-501)
[^arg4-scatter]: "some set foot on those very islands where the heroes had stayed, and they still dwell there, bearing a name derived from Apsyrtus; and others built a fenced city by the dark deep Illyrian river" (Argonautica 4.516-520)
[^arg4-hera]: "Hera restrained them by terrible lightnings from the sky" (Argonautica 4.513)

## In the [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md)

In Apollodorus's account, Apsyrtus is Medea's younger brother. Medea herself killed him during the flight from Colchis: "Medea slew her brother Apsyrtus, and cutting him limb from limb threw the pieces into the deep," forcing Aeetes to stop and gather the fragments, allowing the Argonauts to escape.[^apd-murder]

[^apd-murder]: "Medea slew her brother Apsyrtus, and cutting him limb from limb threw the pieces into the deep" (Bibliotheca 1.9.24, trans. Frazer)

## Variant Traditions

The murder of Apsyrtus differs significantly between sources. In the [Argonautica](../sources/argonautica.md), he is a grown man and military leader who commands the pursuit fleet; [Jason](jason.md) kills him treacherously with [Medea](medea.md)'s help. In the [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md), he is a young child whom Medea kills herself and dismembers during the flight.
