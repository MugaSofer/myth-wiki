## Overview

**Danaus** was the son of Belus and twin brother of Aegyptus, and a descendant of [Io](io.md) through Epaphus and Libya. He was father of fifty daughters who fled Egypt to escape forced marriage to the fifty sons of Aegyptus. In [Argos](../places/argos.md), he secured asylum for his daughters as descendants of the Argive Io.

## In the Bibliotheca

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) records that [Athena](../deities/athena.md) advised Danaus to build a ship when he fled the sons of Aegyptus — "by the advice of Athena he built a ship, being the first to do so" (2.1.4). After the Danaids murdered their bridegrooms on the wedding night, "Athena and [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md) purified them at the command of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md)" (2.1.5).

## In Aeschylus' [Suppliant Maidens](../sources/aeschylus-suppliant-maidens.md)

Danaus serves as father, advisor, and protector to his fifty daughters throughout their flight from Egypt and arrival in Argos. The play's Argument traces the genealogy: from [Io](io.md) to Epaphus, from Epaphus to Libya, from Libya to Belus, and from Belus to "Aegyptus and Danaus."[^sm-arg]

### The Prudent Counselor

On arrival in Argos, Danaus advises his daughters to be cautious and reverent as strangers. He warns them to cling to the altar: "A shrine is stronger than a tower to save, a shield that none may cleave."[^sm-shrine] He counsels modesty in speech: "nor, when ye speak, be voluble nor eager — they that dwell within this land are sternly swift to chide."[^sm-modesty]

He notes the danger his foreign appearance poses: "all unlike to yours the outward semblance that I wear — the race that Nilus rears is all dissimilar that of Inachus."[^sm-appearance] He fears being mistaken for an enemy: "full oft, I ween, friend hath slain friend, not knowing whom he slew."[^sm-friend]

### Securing Asylum

After Pelasgus, King of Argos, agrees to put the matter before the Argive assembly, Danaus goes to lay suppliants' wands at the city's altars. He returns with news that the assembly has voted unanimously to protect them.[^sm-vote]

### The Egyptian Threat

When the Egyptian ships appear, Danaus spots them from the altar-mound and identifies them by their dark-limbed crews and painted-eyed prows.[^sm-ships] He reassures his panicking daughters — "not swiftly puts a fleet to sea, nor swiftly to its moorings" — and departs to fetch Argive help, bidding them not leave the sanctuary.[^sm-calm]

After the Herald of Aegyptus is expelled by Pelasgus, Danaus returns with an escort of spearmen granted by the Argives. He advises his daughters to maintain their chastity: "hold your life less dear than chastity."[^sm-chastity]
