## Overview

**Midas** was a king of Phrygia who received the power to turn everything he touched to gold, a gift from [Dionysus](../deities/dionysus.md) (Bacchus) that proved a curse. After being freed from the golden touch, he offended [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) by preferring [Pan](../deities/pan.md)'s music, and was given donkey ears as punishment.

### The Golden Touch (11.85-145)

After [Dionysus](../deities/dionysus.md) punished the maenads who killed [Orpheus](orpheus.md), he departed for Mount Tmolus. There the Phrygian folk had captured his companion Silenus, "staggering, faint with palsied age and wine," and bound him in garlands before bringing him to King Midas.[^met-mid-silenus] Midas recognized Silenus as "his old time friend" from Bacchic rites and "kept joyful festival, with his old comrade, twice five days and nights."[^met-mid-feast]

When Midas returned Silenus to Dionysus, the god "with great delight, because he had his foster-father once again, allowed the king to choose his own reward — a welcome offer, but it led to harm." Midas asked: "Cause whatsoever I shall touch to change at once to yellow gold."[^met-mid-wish] Dionysus "agreed to his unfortunate request, with grief that Midas chose for harm and not for good."

At first Midas was delighted — twigs, stones, clods, wheat, apples, even doorposts turned to gold. But at his feast, "when he touched the gift of Ceres with his right hand, instantly the gift of Ceres stiffened to gold; or if he tried to bite with hungry teeth a tender bit of meat, the dainty, as his teeth but touched it, shone at once with yellow shreds and flakes of gold."[^met-mid-food] Even wine became "liquid gold" in his mouth.

### Washing in the Pactolus (11.127-145)

"Rich and wretched," Midas begged Dionysus for forgiveness: "Oh pardon me, father Lenaeus! I have done wrong, but pity me, I pray, and save me from this curse that looked so fair." Dionysus told him to go to the source of the river Pactolus near Sardis and "plunge head and body in the snowy foam."[^met-mid-cure] Midas obeyed, and "the gold virtue granted by the god, as it departed from his body, tinged the stream with gold." The narrator notes: "even to this hour adjoining fields, touched by this ancient vein of gold, are hardened where the river flows and colored with the gold that Midas left."[^met-mid-pactolus]

### Donkey Ears (11.146-193)

After this experience, Midas "abhorring riches... inhabited the woods and fields, and followed [Pan](../deities/pan.md) who dwells always in mountain-caves." When Pan boasted of his musical superiority to [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) and they held a contest judged by the mountain-god Tmolus, Pan "made some rustic sounds on his rough reeds, delighting Midas with his uncouth notes." Apollo then played his lyre — "his golden locks were richly wreathed with fresh Parnassian laurel; his robe of Tyrian purple swept the ground" — and Tmolus declared Apollo the winner.[^met-mid-contest]

Midas alone protested, "blaming Tmolus called the award unjust." Apollo punished him: "The Delian god forbids his stupid ears to hold their native human shape; and, drawing them out to a hideous length, he fills them with gray hairs, and makes them both unsteady, wagging at the lower part: still human, only this one part condemned, Midas had ears of a slow-moving ass."[^met-mid-ears]

Midas hid the ears under a purple turban, but "a servant, who was chosen to cut his hair with steel, when it was long, saw his disgrace." The servant "did not dare reveal what he had seen, but eager, to disclose the secret, dug a shallow hole, and in a low voice told what kind of ears were on his master's head." He buried the words, but reeds grew from the spot, and "moved by a gentle South Wind, it repeated all the words which he had whispered, and disclosed from earth the secret of his master's ears."[^met-mid-reeds]

[^met-mid-silenus]: "The Phrygian folk had captured him, as he was staggering, faint with palsied age and wine. And after they bound him in garlands, they led him to their king Midas" (Metamorphoses 11.90-94, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-mid-feast]: "When Midas recognized his old time friend Silenus, who had been so often his companion in the rites of Bacchus, he kept joyful festival, with his old comrade, twice five days and nights" (Metamorphoses 11.94-99)
[^met-mid-wish]: "He with great delight, because he had his foster-father once again, allowed the king to choose his own reward — a welcome offer, but it led to harm. And Midas made this ill-advised reply: 'Cause whatsoever I shall touch to change at once to yellow gold'" (Metamorphoses 11.100-106)
[^met-mid-food]: "when he touched the gift of Ceres with his right hand, instantly the gift of Ceres stiffened to gold; or if he tried to bite with hungry teeth a tender bit of meat, the dainty, as his teeth but touched it, shone at once with yellow shreds and flakes of gold" (Metamorphoses 11.119-126)
[^met-mid-cure]: "That you may not be always cased in gold, which you unhappily desired, depart to the stream that flows by that great town of Sardis and upward trace its waters... plunge head and body in the snowy foam" (Metamorphoses 11.135-142)
[^met-mid-pactolus]: "the gold virtue granted by the god, as it departed from his body, tinged the stream with gold. And even to this hour adjoining fields, touched by this ancient vein of gold, are hardened where the river flows and colored with the gold that Midas left" (Metamorphoses 11.143-149)
[^met-mid-contest]: "Pan made some rustic sounds on his rough reeds, delighting Midas with his uncouth notes... Tmolus ordered Pan to hold his reeds excelled by beauty of Apollo's lyre" (Metamorphoses 11.166-180)
[^met-mid-ears]: "The Delian god forbids his stupid ears to hold their native human shape; and, drawing them out to a hideous length, he fills them with gray hairs, and makes them both unsteady, wagging at the lower part: still human, only this one part condemned, Midas had ears of a slow-moving ass" (Metamorphoses 11.174-180)
[^met-mid-reeds]: "a servant, who was chosen to cut his hair with steel, when it was long, saw his disgrace. He did not dare reveal what he had seen, but eager, to disclose the secret, dug a shallow hole, and in a low voice told what kind of ears were on his master's head... moved by a gentle South Wind, it repeated all the words" (Metamorphoses 11.182-197)
