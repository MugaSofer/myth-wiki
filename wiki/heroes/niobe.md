## Overview

**Niobe** was queen of [Thebes](../places/thebes.md) and mother of fourteen children. Her boast that she surpassed [Leto](../deities/leto.md) — mother of only [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) and [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md) — provoked the twin gods to kill all her children, after which she was transformed into a weeping stone on Mount Sipylus.

## In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md)

### Niobe's Pride (6.146-203)

Niobe, daughter of Tantalus, had known the weaver Arachne in her youth in Maeonia "but the sad fate which overtook Arachne, lost on her, she never ceased her boasting and refused to honor the great Gods."[^met-ni-pride] When Manto, daughter of [Tiresias](tiresias.md), urged the Theban women to worship [Leto](../deities/leto.md) (Latona), Niobe arrived "most conspicuous in her purple robe, bright with inwoven threads of yellow gold. Beautiful in her anger, she tosses back her graceful head."[^met-ni-appear]

She mocked Leto and demanded worship for herself, boasting of her lineage (Tantalus was her father, [Atlas](../deities/atlas.md) her maternal grandfather, [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) both grandfather and father-in-law), her kingdom, her beauty, and above all her seven sons and seven daughters. She sneered that Leto had only two children and "might quite as well be childless."[^met-ni-boast] The women obeyed and abandoned Leto's sacrifice.

### The Slaughter of the Sons (6.218-266)

[Leto](../deities/leto.md), furious, flew to Mount Cynthus and called on [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) and [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md): "Behold your mother, proud of having borne such glorious children! I will yield prestige before no goddess — save alone immortal [Hera](../deities/hera.md)!" Apollo answered: "No more complaint is necessary, for it only serves to hinder the swift sequel of her doom."[^met-ni-apollo]

The twins descended to the citadel of [Cadmus](cadmus.md). Apollo shot Niobe's seven sons one by one on the exercise field: Ismenus was pierced through the breast; Sipylus was struck through the throat while fleeing on horseback; Phaedimus and Tantalus, wrestling together, were transfixed by a single arrow; Alphenor was struck while trying to lift their bodies; Damasicthon was hit twice; and last Ilioneus prayed for mercy — "O Universal Deities, gods of eternal heaven, spare my life!" — but the arrow had already flown, though Apollo's compassion slowed it so "it cut no deeper than his heart."[^met-ni-sons]

### The Daughters and Transformation (6.267-312)

Niobe's husband Amphion "thrust his sword deep in his breast." Still defiant, Niobe railed at Leto: "Glut your revenge! Latona, glut your rage!... Victorious? Nay! — Much more remains to me in all my utmost sorrow, than to you."[^met-ni-defiance] One by one, six of the seven daughters died — each "stricken in a different way." Niobe covered the last child with her body: "Oh, leave me this one child! the youngest of them all! My darling daughter — only leave me one!" But "even while she was entreating for its life — the life was taken."[^met-ni-last]

Childless, she crouched beside the bodies: "a chill of marble spread upon her flesh, beneath her pale, set brows, her eyes moved not, her bitter tongue turned stiff in her hard jaws, her lovely veins congealed." She was changed to stone, carried by a storm to her native land, and "fixed upon a mountain summit she dissolves in tears, and to this day the marble drips with tears."[^met-ni-stone]

[^met-ni-pride]: "the sad fate which overtook Arachne, lost on her, she never ceased her boasting and refused to honor the great Gods" (Metamorphoses 6.148-150, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-ni-appear]: "most conspicuous in her purple robe, bright with inwoven threads of yellow gold. Beautiful in her anger, she tosses back her graceful head" (Metamorphoses 6.167-170)
[^met-ni-boast]: "I am mistress of the palace built by Cadmus... the mother of my seven sons and daughters seven... Who denies my fortunate condition?... Even so deprived, I could not be reduced to only two, as this Latona, who, might quite as well be childless" (Metamorphoses 6.187-203)
[^met-ni-apollo]: "No more complaint is necessary, for it only serves to hinder the swift sequel of her doom" (Metamorphoses 6.215-216)
[^met-ni-sons]: "Ilioneus, last of seven sons, lifted his unavailing arms in prayer, and cried, 'O Universal Deities, gods of eternal heaven, spare my life!' — Besought too late, Apollo of the Bow, could not prevail against the deadly shaft" (Metamorphoses 6.261-268)
[^met-ni-defiance]: "Glut your revenge! Latona, glut your rage! Yea, let my lamentations be your joy!... Victorious? Nay! — Much more remains to me in all my utmost sorrow, than to you" (Metamorphoses 6.286-298)
[^met-ni-last]: "Oh, leave me this one child! the youngest of them all! My darling daughter — only leave me one! But even while she was entreating for its life — the life was taken from her only child" (Metamorphoses 6.299-302)
[^met-ni-stone]: "a chill of marble spread upon her flesh, beneath her pale, set brows, her eyes moved not, her bitter tongue turned stiff in her hard jaws, her lovely veins congealed... fixed upon a mountain summit she dissolves in tears, and to this day the marble drips with tears" (Metamorphoses 6.303-312)
