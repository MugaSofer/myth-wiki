## Overview

**Clytemnestra** was the wife of [Agamemnon](agamemnon.md), king of Mycenae, and sister of [Helen](helen.md). She murdered Agamemnon on his return from Troy, either acting with her lover [Aegisthus](aegisthus.md) or as the principal agent herself. Her motivations, as they accumulate across the sources, include the sacrifice of her daughter [Iphigenia](iphigenia.md) at Aulis, Agamemnon's killing of her first husband and child, and his bringing Cassandra home as a concubine.

## In the Odyssey

In the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md), Agamemnon's ghost warns [Odysseus](odysseus.md) about treacherous wives, naming Clytemnestra as the example. She is described as having joined Aegisthus in the murder. In book XXIV, Agamemnon's shade contrasts Clytemnestra with Penelope: the former plotted her husband's death, while the latter remained faithful.

## In the Bibliotheca

[Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) records that Agamemnon obtained Clytemnestra as wife "after he had slain her spouse Tantalus, the son of Thyestes, together with his newborn babe."[^apd-marriage] After the fall of Troy, she conspired with Aegisthus: "he was murdered by Aegisthus and Clytaemnestra; for she gave him a shirt without sleeves and without a neck, and while he was putting it on he was cut down."[^apd-murder]

## In the Fabulae

[Hyginus](../sources/hyginus.md) records that Clytemnestra heard from Oiax that Agamemnon was bringing Cassandra home as a concubine. She "made a compact with Aegisthus" and killed Agamemnon "with an axe as he was making a sacrifice."[^hyg-murder]

## In the Catalogue of Women

In a Hesiodic fragment, [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md) cursed Tyndareus's daughters — Helen, Clytemnestra, and Timandra — so that they all deserted their husbands.[^cat-curse]

## In Iphigenia in Aulis

In [Euripides](../sources/euripides-iphigenia-aulis.md), Clytemnestra arrives at Aulis with [Iphigenia](iphigenia.md), believing her daughter is to marry [Achilles](achilles.md). When she meets Achilles and discovers he knows nothing of the marriage, the Old Man reveals the truth: Agamemnon plans to sacrifice Iphigenia to [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md).

Clytemnestra supplicates Achilles as the only protector available: "I have no other altar to fly to, but thy knee, nor is any friend near me."[^eur-ia-suppl] She then confronts Agamemnon directly, revealing the violence of their marriage: "thou didst wed me unwilling, and obtain me by force, having slain Tantalus, my former husband, and having dashed my infant living to the ground, having torn him by force from my breast." Her brothers the Dioscuri made war on Agamemnon, but Tyndareus saved him.[^eur-ia-first]

She argues that if anyone's child should die for Helen's sake, it should be [Menelaus](menelaus.md)'s daughter Hermione, not hers. She warns Agamemnon of the consequences: "My child, thy father, who begat thee, hath destroyed thee, himself, no other, the slayer." She threatens: "there wants but a little reason for me and my remaining daughters to give thee such a reception as you deserve."[^eur-ia-threat]

When Iphigenia volunteers to die, Clytemnestra tries to stop her: "Hold! Do not leave me." Iphigenia's last words to her are: "Hate not my father, yes, thy husband," to which Clytemnestra replies: "He needs shall go through terrible trials on thy account."[^eur-ia-hate]

After the divine substitution, the messenger tells her "thy child has evidently flown to the Gods," but Clytemnestra is uncertain: "of whom of the Gods art thou the theft? How shall I address thee? What shall I say that these words do not offer me a vain comfort?"[^eur-ia-doubt]
