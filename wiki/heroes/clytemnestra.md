## Overview

**Clytemnestra** was the wife of [Agamemnon](agamemnon.md), king of Mycenae, and sister of [Helen](helen.md). She murdered Agamemnon on his return from Troy, either acting with her lover [Aegisthus](aegisthus.md) or as the principal agent herself. Her motivations, as they accumulate across the sources, include the sacrifice of her daughter [Iphigenia](iphigenia.md) at Aulis, Agamemnon's killing of her first husband and child, and his bringing Cassandra home as a concubine.

## In the Odyssey

In the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md), Agamemnon's ghost warns [Odysseus](odysseus.md) about treacherous wives, naming Clytemnestra as the example. She is described as having joined Aegisthus in the murder. In book XXIV, Agamemnon's shade contrasts Clytemnestra with Penelope: the former plotted her husband's death, while the latter remained faithful.

## In the Bibliotheca

[Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) records that Agamemnon obtained Clytemnestra as wife "after he had slain her spouse Tantalus, the son of Thyestes, together with his newborn babe."[^apd-marriage] After the fall of Troy, she conspired with Aegisthus: "he was murdered by Aegisthus and Clytaemnestra; for she gave him a shirt without sleeves and without a neck, and while he was putting it on he was cut down."[^apd-murder]

## In the Fabulae

[Hyginus](../sources/hyginus.md) records that Clytemnestra heard from Oiax that Agamemnon was bringing Cassandra home as a concubine. She "made a compact with Aegisthus" and killed Agamemnon "with an axe as he was making a sacrifice."[^hyg-murder]

## In the Catalogue of Women

In a Hesiodic fragment, [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md) cursed Tyndareus's daughters — Helen, Clytemnestra, and Timandra — so that they all deserted their husbands.[^cat-curse]

## In Iphigenia in Aulis

In [Euripides](../sources/euripides-iphigenia-aulis.md), Clytemnestra arrives at Aulis with [Iphigenia](iphigenia.md), believing her daughter is to marry [Achilles](achilles.md). When she meets Achilles and discovers he knows nothing of the marriage, the Old Man reveals the truth: Agamemnon plans to sacrifice Iphigenia to [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md).

Clytemnestra supplicates Achilles as the only protector available: "I have no other altar to fly to, but thy knee, nor is any friend near me."[^eur-ia-suppl] She then confronts Agamemnon directly, revealing the violence of their marriage: "thou didst wed me unwilling, and obtain me by force, having slain Tantalus, my former husband, and having dashed my infant living to the ground, having torn him by force from my breast." Her brothers the Dioscuri made war on Agamemnon, but Tyndareus saved him.[^eur-ia-first]

She argues that if anyone's child should die for Helen's sake, it should be [Menelaus](menelaus.md)'s daughter Hermione, not hers. She warns Agamemnon of the consequences: "My child, thy father, who begat thee, hath destroyed thee, himself, no other, the slayer." She threatens: "there wants but a little reason for me and my remaining daughters to give thee such a reception as you deserve."[^eur-ia-threat]

When Iphigenia volunteers to die, Clytemnestra tries to stop her: "Hold! Do not leave me." Iphigenia's last words to her are: "Hate not my father, yes, thy husband," to which Clytemnestra replies: "He needs shall go through terrible trials on thy account."[^eur-ia-hate]

After the divine substitution, the messenger tells her "thy child has evidently flown to the Gods," but Clytemnestra is uncertain: "of whom of the Gods art thou the theft? How shall I address thee? What shall I say that these words do not offer me a vain comfort?"[^eur-ia-doubt]

## In Aeschylus' Agamemnon

In the *[Agamemnon](../sources/aeschylus-agamemnon.md)*, Clytemnestra is the dominant figure—cunning, eloquent, and terrifying. She has waited years for [Agamemnon](agamemnon.md)'s return, plotting with [Aegisthus](aegisthus.md).

### The Beacon and the Welcome

She describes a relay of beacon fires from Troy to [Argos](../places/argos.md), demonstrating her intelligence and command. When Agamemnon arrives, she lays out purple tapestries for him to walk upon—a gesture of divine honour that tempts him into [hubris](../concepts/hubris.md). Despite his reluctance, she persuades him to tread on the finery.

### The Murder

After Agamemnon enters the palace with [Cassandra](cassandra.md), his death-cries are heard. Clytemnestra emerges blood-spattered and reveals the bodies. She trapped him in a robe-net: "even as men cast the close-hauled net around a shoal of fish, I trapped him round and round in the rich robe, and smote him, once, again."[^ag-net] She struck three blows, and the third brought him down: "with the third stroke he bows his knee and falls."[^ag-blows]

She justifies the killing as vengeance for [Iphigenia](iphigenia.md): "His daughter, blossom of my womb, he gave unto a deadly doom, Iphigenia, child of tears! And as he wrought, even so he fares."[^ag-iphigenia]

### The Curse

Clytemnestra claims to be an instrument of the ancient curse on the house: she prays that the "inborn frenzy of our house is ended, by my deed."[^ag-curse] When Aegisthus arrives and the Chorus defies them both, she asserts joint rule: "I and thou will rule the palace and will order all things well."[^ag-rule]

## In Aeschylus' Libation-Bearers

In the *[Libation-Bearers](../sources/aeschylus-libation-bearers.md)*, Clytemnestra is troubled by a prophetic nightmare: she dreamed she bore a serpent, swaddled it, and nursed it at her breast, and it drew blood with the milk.[^lb-dream] Frightened, she sends libations to [Agamemnon](agamemnon.md)'s tomb by her captive women.

When [Orestes](orestes.md) arrives disguised as a traveler with news of his own death, Clytemnestra welcomes him as a guest. After Aegisthus is killed, she confronts Orestes directly. She bares her breast and pleads: "Stay, child, and fear to strike. O son, this breast pillowed thine head."[^lb-breast] When Orestes is unmoved, she warns: "Beware thy mother's vengeful hounds from hell."[^lb-hounds] Her last words before being driven inside to her death are: "Ah, me! this snake it was I bore and nursed"—fulfilling her own dream.[^lb-snake]

## In Aeschylus' Eumenides

In the *[Eumenides](../sources/aeschylus-eumenides.md)*, Clytemnestra appears as a ghost at [Delphi](../places/delphi.md), rising to rouse the sleeping [Furies](../creatures/erinyes.md). She rebukes them for letting Orestes escape: "Sleep on! awake! what skills your sleep to me—me, among all the dead by you dishonoured."[^eum-ghost] She reminds them of the libations and offerings she once made to them, and demands they resume the hunt: "Blow forth on him the breath of wrath and blood."[^eum-blow]

## In Sophocles' Electra

In [Sophocles](../sources/sophocles-electra.md)' tragedy, Clytemnestra openly justifies killing [Agamemnon](agamemnon.md): he sacrificed [Iphigenia](iphigenia.md) for the sake of Menelaus's war, and therefore deserved death. She is challenged by [Electra](electra.md), who retorts that Agamemnon acted under divine compulsion and that Clytemnestra's real motive was [Aegisthus](aegisthus.md). Clytemnestra's own defence is unambiguous: "So I did: I know it well: that I deny not; for not I alone but Justice slew him."[^soph-el-justice]

### The Prophetic Dream

Clytemnestra has been frightened by a prophetic dream: Agamemnon's ghost returned and planted his sceptre on the hearth, and from it a shoot grew that shadowed all Mycenae. She sends [Chrysothemis](chrysothemis.md) with offerings to Agamemnon's tomb in response. She also prays to [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) for protection and release from her fears.

### The False Report

When the tutor arrives with the false news of Orestes' death in a chariot race, Clytemnestra receives it with mixed feeling: "To be a mother hath a marvellous power: no injury can make one hate one's child."[^soph-el-mother] Yet she is ultimately relieved — the threat to her life is removed: "this day's chance hath freed me from all fear of him."[^soph-el-freed]

### Death

Killed by Orestes offstage. Her cries are heard within: "O son, have pity! Pity the womb that bare thee."[^soph-el-womb] Electra, standing at the door, answers her.

## Variant Traditions

Clytemnestra's role in the murder varies significantly across sources. In the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md), she is a secondary figure alongside [Aegisthus](aegisthus.md). In the [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md), both conspire equally. In the [Fabulae](../sources/hyginus.md), she is motivated by Oiax's false report about Cassandra. In Aeschylus' *Agamemnon*, she is the sole planner and executioner, with Aegisthus arriving only afterward to claim credit.

The murder weapon also differs: the Bibliotheca describes "a shirt without sleeves and without a neck" (a garment-trap); Hyginus says "an axe"; Aeschylus describes a robe-net and a sword (or axe).
