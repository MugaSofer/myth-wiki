## Overview

**Erysichthon** is a Thessalian king who desecrated [Demeter](../deities/demeter.md)'s sacred grove and was punished with an insatiable hunger that ultimately consumed him. His story in the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md) is told by the river-god Achelous to [Theseus](theseus.md).

## In Callimachus's Hymns

### The Sacrilege (Hymn VI.24-65)

Callimachus tells the earliest surviving full account. [Demeter](../deities/demeter.md) had a sacred grove at Dotium among the Pelasgians, "abounding in trees; hardly would an arrow have passed through them."[^call-grove] Erysichthon "hastened with twenty attendants, all in their prime, all men-giants able to lift a whole city, arming them both with double axes and with hatchets, and they rushed shameless into the grove of Demeter."[^call-rush]

When they struck a great poplar, it "cried a woeful cry to the others." Demeter disguised herself as her priestess Nicippe and warned him: "My child, who cuttest down the trees which are dedicated to the gods, stay, my child, child of thy parents' many prayers, cease and turn back thine attendants, lest the lady Demeter be angered."[^call-warning]

He replied with savage defiance, threatening to bury his axe in her flesh and build a banquet-hall from the wood. Nemesis recorded his speech. Then Demeter revealed herself: "Her steps touched the earth, but her head reached unto Olympus." His men fled, "half-dead when they beheld the lady goddess," leaving their axes in the trees. Demeter cursed him: "Yea, yea, build thy house, dog, dog, that thou art, wherein thou shalt hold festival; for frequent banquets shall be thine hereafter."[^call-curse]

### The Hunger (Hymn VI.66-117)

"Straightway she sent on him a cruel and evil hunger — a burning hunger and a strong — and he was tormented by a grievous disease. Wretched man, as much as he ate, so much did he desire again. Twenty prepared the banquet for him, and twelve drew wine."[^call-hunger]

His parents hid him from society, inventing elaborate excuses — a wound from a boar, a fall from a chariot, counting flocks on Othrys — whenever guests came calling. He consumed everything: "the mules they loosed from the great wains and he ate the heifer that his mother was feeding for [Hestia](../deities/hestia.md) and the racing horse and the war charger, and the cat at which the little vermin trembled."[^call-ate]

His father Triopas appealed in vain to [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) (Triopas's divine father through Canace, daughter of Aeolus): "False father, behold this the third generation of thy sons... Either do thou remove from him his cruel disease or take and feed him thyself; for my tables are already exhausted."[^call-triopas] Finally, "when his teeth dried up the rich house, then the king's son sat at the crossways, begging for crusts and the cast out refuse of the feast."[^call-begging]

[^call-grove]: "a fair grove abounding in trees; hardly would an arrow have passed through them. Therein was pine, and therein were mighty elms, and therein were pear-trees" (Callimachus, Hymn VI.26-28, trans. A.W. Mair)
[^call-rush]: "He hastened with twenty attendants, all in their prime, all men-giants able to lift a whole city, arming them both with double axes and with hatchets, and they rushed shameless into the grove of Demeter" (Callimachus, Hymn VI.31-36)
[^call-warning]: "My child, who cuttest down the trees which are dedicated to the gods, stay, my child, child of thy parents' many prayers, cease and turn back thine attendants, lest the lady Demeter be angered" (Callimachus, Hymn VI.43-49)
[^call-curse]: "Her steps touched the earth, but her head reached unto Olympus... Yea, yea, build thy house, dog, dog, that thou art, wherein thou shalt hold festival; for frequent banquets shall be thine hereafter" (Callimachus, Hymn VI.58-65)
[^call-hunger]: "Straightway she sent on him a cruel and evil hunger — a burning hunger and a strong... as much as he ate, so much did he desire again. Twenty prepared the banquet for him, and twelve drew wine" (Callimachus, Hymn VI.66-71)
[^call-ate]: "the mules they loosed from the great wains and he ate the heifer that his mother was feeding for Hestia and the racing horse and the war charger, and the cat at which the little vermin trembled" (Callimachus, Hymn VI.107-110)
[^call-triopas]: "False father, behold this the third generation of thy sons... Either do thou remove from him his cruel disease or take and feed him thyself; for my tables are already exhausted" (Callimachus, Hymn VI.96-106)
[^call-begging]: "when his teeth dried up the rich house, then the king's son sat at the crossways, begging for crusts and the cast out refuse of the feast" (Callimachus, Hymn VI.111-113)

## Variant Traditions

The two main sources — Callimachus (Hymn VI) and Ovid ([Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md) 8) — differ in several details:

- **The tree**: In Callimachus, it is a poplar in a general grove; in Ovid, it is a specific enormous oak containing a dryad
- **Demeter's warning**: In Callimachus, Demeter herself appears disguised as her priestess; in Ovid, she sends the abstract personification of Famine from Scythia
- **The end**: Callimachus has Erysichthon reduced to begging at crossroads; Ovid has him gnawing his own flesh. Callimachus does not mention the daughter Mestra, while Ovid includes her shape-shifting as a major episode
- **Tone**: Callimachus's version is more darkly comic (the elaborate parental excuses); Ovid's is more horrific (the vivid personification of Famine, the self-cannibalism)

## In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md)

### The Sacred Oak (8.738-776)

Erysichthon "spurned the majesty of all the Gods, and gave no honor to their altars." He took an axe to [Demeter](../deities/demeter.md)'s sacred grove and cut at an enormous ancient oak — so large that "alone it seemed a standing forest." When a servant tried to restrain him, Erysichthon "turned the poised axe from the tree, and clove his head sheer from his body."[^met-ery-servant]

As the axe struck the oak, "red blood poured from the wound." A dryad dwelling within spoke: "Covered by the bark of this oak tree I long have dwelt a Nymph, beloved of Ceres, and before my death it has been granted me to prophesy, that I may die contented. Punishment for this vile deed stands waiting at your side."[^met-ery-dryad]

### The Curse of Famine (8.777-842)

The sister dryads appealed to [Demeter](../deities/demeter.md), who sent an Oread to the frozen wastes of Scythia to summon Famine herself. The personification of Famine is described vividly: "her hollow eyes glared in her ghastly face, her lips were filthy and her throat was rough and blotched, and all her entrails could be seen, enclosed in nothing but her shriveled skin; her crooked loins were dry uncovered bones, and where her belly should be was a void."[^met-ery-famine]

Famine came to Erysichthon at midnight and "breathed her pestilential poison through his mouth and throat and breast, and spread the curse of utmost hunger in his aching veins."[^met-ery-curse] He awoke to a ravenous hunger that could not be sated: "The food of cities and a nation failed to satisfy the cravings of one man. The more his stomach gets, the more it needs."[^met-ery-hunger]

### Mestra and the End (8.843-878)

When all his wealth was consumed, Erysichthon sold his own daughter Mestra into slavery. She prayed to [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md), who had seduced her, and the god granted her the power to change shape — transforming her into a fisherman to escape her master. Her father, discovering this ability, "often sold her first to one and then another — all of whom she cheated — as a mare, bird, a cow, or as a stag she got away; and so brought food, dishonestly, to ease his greed."[^met-ery-mestra]

But even this was not enough. "His anguish burned him with increasing heat. He gnawed his own flesh, and he tore his limbs and fed his body all he took from it."[^met-ery-end]

[^met-ery-servant]: "he turned the poised axe from the tree, and clove his head sheer from his body, and again began to chop the hard oak" (Metamorphoses 8.758-761, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-ery-dryad]: "Covered by the bark of this oak tree I long have dwelt a Nymph, beloved of Ceres, and before my death it has been granted me to prophesy, that I may die contented. Punishment for this vile deed stands waiting at your side" (Metamorphoses 8.762-768, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-ery-famine]: "her hollow eyes glared in her ghastly face, her lips were filthy and her throat was rough and blotched, and all her entrails could be seen, enclosed in nothing but her shriveled skin; her crooked loins were dry uncovered bones, and where her belly should be was a void" (Metamorphoses 8.801-808, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-ery-curse]: "she breathed her pestilential poison through his mouth and throat and breast, and spread the curse of utmost hunger in his aching veins" (Metamorphoses 8.818-821, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-ery-hunger]: "The food of cities and a nation failed to satisfy the cravings of one man. The more his stomach gets, the more it needs" (Metamorphoses 8.836-838, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-ery-mestra]: "he often sold her first to one and then another — all of whom she cheated — as a mare, bird, a cow, or as a stag she got away; and so brought food, dishonestly, to ease his greed" (Metamorphoses 8.869-873, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-ery-end]: "He gnawed his own flesh, and he tore his limbs and fed his body all he took from it" (Metamorphoses 8.877-878, trans. Brookes More)
