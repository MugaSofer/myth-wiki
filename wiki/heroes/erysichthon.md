## Overview

**Erysichthon** is a Thessalian king who desecrated [Demeter](../deities/demeter.md)'s sacred grove and was punished with an insatiable hunger that ultimately consumed him. His story in the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md) is told by the river-god Achelous to [Theseus](theseus.md).

## In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md)

### The Sacred Oak (8.738-776)

Erysichthon "spurned the majesty of all the Gods, and gave no honor to their altars." He took an axe to [Demeter](../deities/demeter.md)'s sacred grove and cut at an enormous ancient oak — so large that "alone it seemed a standing forest." When a servant tried to restrain him, Erysichthon "turned the poised axe from the tree, and clove his head sheer from his body."[^met-ery-servant]

As the axe struck the oak, "red blood poured from the wound." A dryad dwelling within spoke: "Covered by the bark of this oak tree I long have dwelt a Nymph, beloved of Ceres, and before my death it has been granted me to prophesy, that I may die contented. Punishment for this vile deed stands waiting at your side."[^met-ery-dryad]

### The Curse of Famine (8.777-842)

The sister dryads appealed to [Demeter](../deities/demeter.md), who sent an Oread to the frozen wastes of Scythia to summon Famine herself. The personification of Famine is described vividly: "her hollow eyes glared in her ghastly face, her lips were filthy and her throat was rough and blotched, and all her entrails could be seen, enclosed in nothing but her shriveled skin; her crooked loins were dry uncovered bones, and where her belly should be was a void."[^met-ery-famine]

Famine came to Erysichthon at midnight and "breathed her pestilential poison through his mouth and throat and breast, and spread the curse of utmost hunger in his aching veins."[^met-ery-curse] He awoke to a ravenous hunger that could not be sated: "The food of cities and a nation failed to satisfy the cravings of one man. The more his stomach gets, the more it needs."[^met-ery-hunger]

### Mestra and the End (8.843-878)

When all his wealth was consumed, Erysichthon sold his own daughter Mestra into slavery. She prayed to [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md), who had seduced her, and the god granted her the power to change shape — transforming her into a fisherman to escape her master. Her father, discovering this ability, "often sold her first to one and then another — all of whom she cheated — as a mare, bird, a cow, or as a stag she got away; and so brought food, dishonestly, to ease his greed."[^met-ery-mestra]

But even this was not enough. "His anguish burned him with increasing heat. He gnawed his own flesh, and he tore his limbs and fed his body all he took from it."[^met-ery-end]
