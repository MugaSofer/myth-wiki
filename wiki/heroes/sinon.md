## Overview

**Sinon** was the Greek warrior who volunteered to remain outside the Wooden Horse and deceive the Trojans into bringing it within their walls. His role required extraordinary endurance: the Trojans tortured him, cutting off his ears and nose, yet he maintained his false story. His resolve was the hinge on which the stratagem — and the fall of [Troy](../places/troy.md) — turned.

## In the [Posthomerica](../sources/posthomerica.md)

### The Volunteer (Book XII)

When [Odysseus](odysseus.md) outlined his plan for the Wooden Horse, he called for "some brave man, one whom the Trojans know not" to remain outside and deceive them. "When all others feared," Sinon alone stepped forward, "marked of destiny to bring the great work to accomplishment." He pledged himself with total resolve: "yea, though they torture me, though into fire living they thrust me; for mine heart is fixed not to escape, but die by hands of foes, except I crown with glory your desire."[^post-volunteer]

The Greeks were astonished: "How the Gods have given to-day high courage to this man! He hath not been heretofore valiant. Heaven is kindling him to be the Trojans' ruin, but to us salvation."[^post-courage]

### The Torture (Book XII)

When the Trojans found Sinon beside the Horse, they questioned him "first with unangry words, then with terrible threatenings." Then they tortured him: "Firm as a rock abode the unquivering limbs, the unconquerable will. His ears, his nose, at last they shore away in every wise tormenting him." He endured "their cruel stripes, yea, and the bitter torment of the fire; for strong endurance into him [Hera](../deities/hera.md) breathed."[^post-torture]

Throughout, he maintained his cover story: that the Argives had fled, that the Horse was an offering to [Athena](../deities/athena.md) to propitiate her wrath for the stolen Palladium, and that he himself had been marked for sacrifice to the sea-powers but escaped by clinging to the Horse's feet.[^post-story]

### The Deception Succeeds (Book XII)

"Of the Trojans some believed him, others for a wily knave held him, of whose mind was Laocoon." When Laocoon urged them to burn the Horse, Athena struck him blind, and the Trojans, "dread of the Prey-giver" falling on them, pitied Sinon at last and "led him in friendly wise to Troy."[^post-success]

### Honour after the Victory (Book XIV)

After Troy fell, the Greeks celebrated Sinon at their feast: "Far-famed Sinon they extolled for that dire torment he endured of foes; yea, song and honour-guerdons without end all rendered him: and that resolved soul glad-hearted joyed for the Argives' victory, and for his own misfeaturing sorrowed not. For to the wise and prudent man renown is better far than gold, than goodlihead, than all good things men have or hope to win."[^post-honour]

## In Other Sources

In the [Aeneid](../sources/aeneid.md), Sinon deceives the Trojans with a false story about being left behind as a sacrifice, persuading them to bring the Horse within the walls. His deception is a central episode of Book II.
