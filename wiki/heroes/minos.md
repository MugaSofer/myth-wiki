# Minos

King of **[Crete](../places/crete.md)**, son of **[Zeus](../deities/zeus.md)** and **Europa**. Minos became the great lawgiver of the Cretans and, after extending his rule over almost all the islands, was the first to obtain dominion of the sea. After death he serves as a judge in **[Hades](../deities/hades.md)**.

## In the Bibliotheca (3.1.1-3.3.2)

### Birth and the Kingdom

Europa bore three sons to Zeus in Crete: Minos, Sarpedon, and Rhadamanthys.[^apd-europa-sons] The Catalogue of Women gives a fuller account of Zeus's abduction: "she crossed the briny water from afar to Crete, beguiled by the wiles of Zeus. Secretly did the Father snatch her away and gave her a gift, the golden necklace, the toy which [Hephaestus](../deities/hephaestus.md) the famed craftsman once made." Of the three sons, the Catalogue adds that Minos was "the ruler" and "most kingly of mortal kings... holding the sceptre of Zeus wherewith he ruled many," while Sarpedon "reigned mightily over wide Lycia" and Zeus "ordained that he should live for three generations of mortal men."[^cat-europa]

A shorter fragment gives additional detail: "Zeus saw Europa the daughter of Phoenix gathering flowers in a meadow with some nymphs and fell in love with her. So he came down and changed himself into a bull and breathed from his mouth a crocus." He "deceived Europa, carried her off and crossed the sea to Crete where he had intercourse with her."[^cat-crocus]

[^cat-europa]: "she crossed the briny water from afar to Crete, beguiled by the wiles of Zeus. Secretly did the Father snatch her away and gave her a gift, the golden necklace, the toy which Hephaestus the famed craftsman once made... Minos the ruler, and just Rhadamanthys and noble Sarpedon the blameless and strong" (Catalogue of Women, Fragment 19A, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^cat-crocus]: "Zeus saw Europa the daughter of Phoenix gathering flowers in a meadow with some nymphs and fell in love with her. So he came down and changed himself into a bull and breathed from his mouth a crocus" (Catalogue of Women, Fragment 19, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

Asterius, prince of the Cretans, married Europa and raised her children. When the brothers grew up they quarrelled over a boy called Miletus, son of **[Apollo](../deities/apollo.md)**, and Minos prevailed in the resulting war.[^apd-minos-quarrel]

When Asterius died childless, Minos claimed the throne but was opposed. He alleged divine right and prayed to **[Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md)** to send a bull from the sea, promising to sacrifice it. Poseidon sent up a fine bull and Minos obtained the kingdom — but he kept the bull and sacrificed another in its place.[^apd-minos-bull]

### The Minotaur

Angered at the deception, Poseidon made the bull savage and contrived that Pasiphae, Minos's wife (daughter of the Sun), should conceive a passion for it. With the help of **Daedalus**, who constructed a hollow wooden cow, Pasiphae coupled with the bull and gave birth to Asterius, called the **Minotaur** — he had the face of a bull but the rest of him was human. Minos shut him in the **Labyrinth**, also built by Daedalus.[^apd-minotaur-birth]

### Children of Minos

By Pasiphae, Minos had sons Catreus, Deucalion, Glaucus, and Androgeus, and daughters Acalle, Xenodice, **[Ariadne](../heroes/ariadne.md)**, and Phaedra.[^apd-minos-children]

Catreus, learning from an oracle that he would die by the hand of one of his children, saw his son Althaemenes flee to Rhodes to avoid the prophecy. He gave daughters Aerope and Clymene to Nauplius to sell abroad — Aerope became wife of Plisthenes and mother of **Agamemnon** and **Menelaus**.[^apd-catreus] In old age Catreus travelled to Rhodes to pass the kingdom to Althaemenes, but was killed by his own son, who did not recognize him in the dark — thus fulfilling the oracle.[^apd-catreus-death]

Glaucus, while still a child, fell into a jar of honey and drowned. The seer Polyidus found him by divination and was shut up with the corpse; there he observed a serpent revive its dead companion with a herb, and applied the same herb to raise Glaucus from the dead.[^apd-glaucus-honey]

### The Tribute and Death

Androgeus was killed at Athens — some say sent against the bull of Marathon by Aegeus, others say waylaid by competitors at the games of Laius.[^apd-androgeus] In vengeance Minos attacked Athens with a fleet and, after the city was struck with famine and pestilence, forced the Athenians to send seven youths and seven maidens as tribute to the Minotaur.[^apd-minos-tribute]

Minos met his end pursuing Daedalus to Sicily. He carried a spiral shell as a test, promising reward to whoever could thread it. At Camicus, King Cocalus took the shell and gave it to Daedalus, who threaded it by fastening it to an ant. When Minos demanded Daedalus's surrender, the daughters of Cocalus killed Minos in his bath — some say by drenching him with boiling water.[^apd-minos-death]

## In the Fabulae

### Pasiphae and the Bull (§40)

The Fabulae attributes Pasiphae's passion to [Venus](../deities/aphrodite.md): "Pasiphae, daughter of [Sol](../deities/helius.md) and wife of Minos, for several years did not make offerings to the goddess Venus. Because of this Venus inspired in her an unnatural love for a bull."[^hyg40-curse]

Daedalus aided her: "At the time when Daedalus came there as an exile, he asked her to help him. For her he made a wooden heifer, and put in it the hide of a real heifer, and in this she lay with the bull. From this intercourse she bore the Minotaur, with bull's head but human body."[^hyg40-minotaur]

When Minos discovered the affair, "he cast Daedalus into prison, but Pasiphae freed him from his chains. And so Daedalus made wings and fitted them to himself and to his son Icarus, and they flew away from that place."[^hyg40-escape] The Fabulae notes an alternative: "Others say that after Theseus killed the Minotaur he brought Daedalus back to Athens, his own country."[^hyg40-variant]

[^hyg40-curse]: "Pasiphae, daughter of Sol and wife of Minos, for several years did not make offerings to the goddess Venus. Because of this Venus inspired in her an unnatural love for a bull" (Fabulae §40, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg40-minotaur]: "At the time when Daedalus came there as an exile, he asked her to help him. For her he made a wooden heifer, and put in it the hide of a real heifer, and in this she lay with the bull. From this intercourse she bore the Minotaur, with bull's head but human body. Then Daedalus made for the Minotaur a labyrinth with an undiscoverable exit in which it was confined" (Fabulae §40, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg40-escape]: "When Minos found out the affair he cast Daedalus into prison, but Pasiphae freed him from his chains. And so Daedalus made wings and fitted them to himself and to his son Icarus, and they flew away from that place. Icarus flew too high, and when the wax was melted by the sun, fell into the sea which was named Icarian for him. Daedalus flew on to King Cocalus in the island of Sicily" (Fabulae §40, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg40-variant]: "Others say that after Theseus killed the Minotaur he brought Daedalus back to Athens, his own country" (Fabulae §40, trans. Mary Grant)

### The Minotaur Tribute (§41)

Hyginus explains the tribute differently: "When Minos, son of [Jove](../deities/zeus.md) and Europa, fought with the Athenians, his son Androgeus was killed in the fight."[^hyg41-androgeus] The consequences: "After he conquered the Athenians their revenues became his; he decreed, moreover, that each year they should send seven of their children as food for the Minotaur."[^hyg41-tribute]

When [Theseus](theseus.md) volunteered, "his father sent him off" with instructions: "he charged him to have white sails for his ships if he came back as victor; those who were sent to the Minotaur journeyed with black sails."[^hyg41-sails]

[^hyg41-androgeus]: "When Minos, son of Jove and Europa, fought with the Athenians, his son Androgeus was killed in the fight" (Fabulae §41, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg41-tribute]: "After he conquered the Athenians their revenues became his; he decreed, moreover, that each year they should send seven of their children as food for the Minotaur" (Fabulae §41, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg41-sails]: "After Theseus had come from Troezene, and had learned what a calamity afflicted the state, of his own accord he promised to go against the Minotaur. When his father sent him off, he charged him to have white sails for his ships if he came back as victor; those who were sent to the Minotaur journeyed with black sails" (Fabulae §41, trans. Mary Grant)

### Polyidus and Glaucus (§136)

The Fabulae preserves the full story of Glaucus's resurrection. "When Glaucus, son of Minos and Pasiphae, was playing ball, he fell into a jar full of honey."[^hyg136-death] Apollo's oracle was cryptic: "A prodigy has been born for you. Whoever explains it will restore the child to you."[^hyg136-oracle]

The prodigy was "a bullock had been born which changed colour three times a day, every four hours — first white, then red, then black."[^hyg136-bullock] Polyidus explained: "the bullock was like a mulberry tree, for first its fruit is white, then red, and when ripe, black."[^hyg136-solution]

Minos then demanded: "You have found the body. Now restore life to it."[^hyg136-demand] Shut in the tomb with the corpse, Polyidus witnessed a miracle: "a snake suddenly made for the body of the boy, and Polyidus, judging the creature wished to devour the body, suddenly drew the sword and killed it. Another snake, seeking its mate, saw that it was dead, and came and brought a herb, and its touch restored life to the dead snake. Polyidus did the same."[^hyg136-resurrection]

After Glaucus was restored, "Minos sent Polyidus many gifts back into his country."[^hyg136-gifts]

[^hyg136-death]: "When Glaucus, son of Minos and Pasiphae, was playing ball, he fell into a jar full of honey. In the parents' search, they made inquiry of Apollo about the boy" (Fabulae §136, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg136-oracle]: "Apollo told them: A prodigy has been born for you. Whoever explains it will restore the child to you" (Fabulae §136, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg136-bullock]: "Upon hearing this reply, Minos began inquiring from his people about the prodigy. They told him that a bullock had been born which changed colour three times a day, every four hours — first white, then red, then black" (Fabulae §136, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg136-solution]: "Polyidus, son of Coeranus, showed that the bullock was like a mulberry tree, for first its fruit is white, then red, and when ripe, black" (Fabulae §136, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg136-demand]: "Then Minos said to him: According to the words of Apollo, you should be able to restore my son to me. While Polyidus was observing omens, he saw an owl sitting over the wine-cellar and putting bees to flight. He interpreted the omen, and brought out the lifeless boy from the jar. Minos said to him: You have found the body. Now restore life to it" (Fabulae §136, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg136-resurrection]: "When Polyidus said this was impossible, Minos ordered him to be shut in a tomb with the boy, and a sword placed there. When they had been shut in, a snake suddenly made for the body of the boy, and Polyidus, judging the creature wished to devour the body, suddenly drew the sword and killed it. Another snake, seeking its mate, saw that it was dead, and came and brought a herb, and its touch restored life to the dead snake. Polyidus did the same. When they called out from within, a passerby reported it to Minos, who opened the tomb and found his son safe" (Fabulae §136, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg136-gifts]: "He sent Polyidus many gifts back into his country" (Fabulae §136, trans. Mary Grant)
