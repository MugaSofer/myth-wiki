# Minos

King of **[Crete](../places/crete.md)**, son of **[Zeus](../deities/zeus.md)** and **Europa**. Minos became the great lawgiver of the Cretans and, after extending his rule over almost all the islands, was the first to obtain dominion of the sea. After death he serves as a judge in **[Hades](../deities/hades.md)**.

## In the Bibliotheca (3.1.1-3.3.2)

### Birth and the Kingdom

Europa bore three sons to Zeus in Crete: Minos, Sarpedon, and Rhadamanthys.[^apd-europa-sons] Asterius, prince of the Cretans, married Europa and raised her children. When the brothers grew up they quarrelled over a boy called Miletus, son of **[Apollo](../deities/apollo.md)**, and Minos prevailed in the resulting war.[^apd-minos-quarrel]

When Asterius died childless, Minos claimed the throne but was opposed. He alleged divine right and prayed to **[Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md)** to send a bull from the sea, promising to sacrifice it. Poseidon sent up a fine bull and Minos obtained the kingdom — but he kept the bull and sacrificed another in its place.[^apd-minos-bull]

### The Minotaur

Angered at the deception, Poseidon made the bull savage and contrived that Pasiphae, Minos's wife (daughter of the Sun), should conceive a passion for it. With the help of **Daedalus**, who constructed a hollow wooden cow, Pasiphae coupled with the bull and gave birth to Asterius, called the **Minotaur** — he had the face of a bull but the rest of him was human. Minos shut him in the **Labyrinth**, also built by Daedalus.[^apd-minotaur-birth]

### Children of Minos

By Pasiphae, Minos had sons Catreus, Deucalion, Glaucus, and Androgeus, and daughters Acalle, Xenodice, **[Ariadne](../heroes/ariadne.md)**, and Phaedra.[^apd-minos-children]

Catreus, learning from an oracle that he would die by the hand of one of his children, saw his son Althaemenes flee to Rhodes to avoid the prophecy. He gave daughters Aerope and Clymene to Nauplius to sell abroad — Aerope became wife of Plisthenes and mother of **Agamemnon** and **Menelaus**.[^apd-catreus] In old age Catreus travelled to Rhodes to pass the kingdom to Althaemenes, but was killed by his own son, who did not recognize him in the dark — thus fulfilling the oracle.[^apd-catreus-death]

Glaucus, while still a child, fell into a jar of honey and drowned. The seer Polyidus found him by divination and was shut up with the corpse; there he observed a serpent revive its dead companion with a herb, and applied the same herb to raise Glaucus from the dead.[^apd-glaucus-honey]

### The Tribute and Death

Androgeus was killed at Athens — some say sent against the bull of Marathon by Aegeus, others say waylaid by competitors at the games of Laius.[^apd-androgeus] In vengeance Minos attacked Athens with a fleet and, after the city was struck with famine and pestilence, forced the Athenians to send seven youths and seven maidens as tribute to the Minotaur.[^apd-minos-tribute]

Minos met his end pursuing Daedalus to Sicily. He carried a spiral shell as a test, promising reward to whoever could thread it. At Camicus, King Cocalus took the shell and gave it to Daedalus, who threaded it by fastening it to an ant. When Minos demanded Daedalus's surrender, the daughters of Cocalus killed Minos in his bath — some say by drenching him with boiling water.[^apd-minos-death]
