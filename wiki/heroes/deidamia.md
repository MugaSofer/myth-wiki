## Overview

**Deidamia** was a princess of [Scyros](../places/scyros.md), daughter of King Lycomedes. When [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md) hid the young [Achilles](achilles.md) among Lycomedes' daughters disguised as a maiden, Achilles fell in love with Deidamia and fathered a son, Pyrrhus — later known as [Neoptolemus](neoptolemus.md). She is mentioned briefly in the mythological handbooks but given her fullest characterisation in Statius's [Achilleid](../sources/achilleid.md).

## In the Bibliotheca

[Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) records that Thetis brought Achilles to Lycomedes' court, "and being reared with his daughters, Achilles had a secret intrigue with Deidamia, daughter of Lycomedes, and there was born a son [Neoptolemus]."[^apd-deidamia]

[^apd-deidamia]: "And being reared with his daughters, Achilles had a secret intrigue with Deidamia, daughter of Lycomedes, and there was born a son Pyrrhus, who was afterwards called Neoptolemus" (Bibliotheca 3.13.8, trans. J.G. Frazer)

## In the Fabulae

[Hyginus](../sources/hyginus.md) names Deidamia as the mother of Pyrrhus (Neoptolemus) by Achilles during his time at Lycomedes' court. Achilles was "kept among his virgin daughters in woman's attire" and "called Pyrrha because of his tawny hair."[^hyg-deidamia]

[^hyg-deidamia]: Fabulae §96. Achilles kept among Lycomedes' daughters; fathered Pyrrhus by Deidamia.

## In the Achilleid

Statius gives Deidamia her richest characterisation. She is "queen of the lovely choir" of Lycomedes' daughters, outshining her sisters: "The bright colour flames upon her rosy countenance, a more brilliant light is in her jewels, the gold has a more alluring gleam." The sight of her is what makes Achilles willing to accept the feminine disguise.[^ach-beauty]

### Courtship and Discovery

When Achilles first saw her among the princesses at a festival of [Pallas](../deities/athena.md), he "stood spellbound and drank in strange fire through all his frame."[^ach-fire] During his disguise, he pursued her relentlessly — "her he follows, and persistently besets" — teaching her the lyre and songs of [Chiron](../creatures/chiron.md)'s instruction, binding her in embraces and praising her "amid a thousand kisses." She in turn "marvels at the deep tones of his voice, how he shuns all her fellows and pierces her with too-attentive gaze."[^ach-courtship]

Only Deidamia knew Achilles' true sex. She suspected but avoided confrontation — "she like a fickle girl avoids him, and will not allow him to confess."[^ach-secret] During a Bacchic festival forbidden to men, Achilles seized her. She "filled the grove and mountain with her cries," but the revellers took it for the ritual shout. She concealed the pregnancy with her nurse's help and bore a son.[^ach-assault]

When [Odysseus](odysseus.md) arrived at court, Deidamia worked to keep Achilles hidden — she "clasped him to her soft bosom, and ever covered with her own robe his bare breast and naked arms and shoulders, and many a time forbidden him to start up from the couch."[^ach-concealment] But Odysseus's trap of arms among trinkets exposed him.

[^ach-beauty]: "The bright colour flames upon her rosy countenance, a more brilliant light is in her jewels, the gold has a more alluring gleam" (Achilleid 1.297-298, trans. J.H. Mozley)
[^ach-fire]: "The lad, ungentle as he was and heart-whole from any touch of passion, stood spellbound and drank in strange fire through all his frame" (Achilleid 1.303-305)
[^ach-courtship]: "Her he follows, and persistently besets, toward her he ever and again directs his gaze" (Achilleid 1.565-567)
[^ach-secret]: "She like a fickle girl avoids him, and will not allow him to confess" (Achilleid 1.578-579)
[^ach-assault]: Achilleid 1.640-674. During the Bacchic festival; Deidamia's concealment; birth of Pyrrhus.
[^ach-concealment]: "If Deidamia, to warn the hasty youth, had not clasped him to her soft bosom, and ever covered with her own robe his bare breast and naked arms and shoulders" (Achilleid 1.766-769)

### The Lament at Parting

Deidamia's farewell speech is the emotional climax of the poem. On the night before his departure, she addresses Achilles:

"Shall I see thee again, and lay myself on this breast of thine, O son of Aeacus? Wilt thou deign once more to look upon thy offspring?" She fears both his death and his infidelity — "soon the fair Trojan dames will sigh for thee with tears and beat their breasts, and pray that they may offer their necks to thy fetters." She asks to go with him as a companion: "Why should I not carry the standards of Mars with thee? Thou didst carry with me the wands and holy things of Bacchus." And she ends with a plea about their son: "keep him at least within thy heart, and grant this one request, that no foreign wife bear thee a child, that no captive woman give unworthy grandsons to [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md)."[^ach-lament]

The narrator's final comment is devastating: "The fickle breezes swept his words unfulfilled away."[^ach-breezes]

[^ach-lament]: "Shall I see thee again, and lay myself on this breast of thine, O son of Aeacus?... soon the fair Trojan dames will sigh for thee... Why should I not carry the standards of Mars with thee? Thou didst carry with me the wands and holy things of Bacchus... that no captive woman give unworthy grandsons to Thetis" (Achilleid 1.927-956, trans. J.H. Mozley)
[^ach-breezes]: "The fickle breezes swept his words unfulfilled away" (Achilleid 1.960)
