## Overview

**Ion** was the son of [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) and [Creusa](creusa-athens.md), daughter of [Erechtheus](erechtheus.md) king of [Athens](../places/athens.md). Exposed at birth and secretly carried to [Delphi](../places/delphi.md) by [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md), he was raised as a temple servant with no knowledge of his parents. He was later given to Xuthus by Apollo's oracle as his "son," survived a poisoning attempt by his own mother (who did not recognise him), and was eventually revealed as Apollo's child and the ancestor of the Ionian race.

## In Euripides' [Ion](../sources/euripides-ion.md)

### Early Life at Delphi

Ion was raised from infancy in Apollo's temple at Delphi, found by the Priestess who "to pity she resign'd the harsh intent." He grew up tending the shrine — sweeping with laurel boughs, sprinkling holy water, chasing birds — and regarded the temple as his home: "A mother's fondness, and a father's care I never knew: the temple of the god claims then my service, for it nurtured me."[^eur-ion-orphan] He called the Priestess his mother and considered Apollo a father-figure: "Phoebus is to me a sire."[^eur-ion-sire]

### The Oracle and Xuthus

When Xuthus received Apollo's oracle that the first person he met would be his son, he embraced Ion, to the young man's alarm. Ion initially resisted — he feared Athens would reject a foreigner's bastard — and delivered a long speech praising the humble contentment of temple life over the dangers of political ambition: "Be mine the humble blessings of private life, rather than be a king."[^eur-ion-humble] He accepted reluctantly, and was given the name "Ion" by Xuthus.

### Near-Death and Recognition

Creusa, not knowing Ion was her lost son, sent poison for his cup. Ion was saved when he poured his wine as a libation and a dove drank it and died. He discovered the plot, and the Delphian council condemned Creusa to death. At the altar where Creusa had taken refuge, the Priestess brought forth the ark in which she had found Ion as an infant. Creusa recognised it and proved her claim by naming the tokens inside unseen: a cloth woven with a Gorgon design, two golden dragons in the tradition of [Erichthonius](erechtheus.md), and a branch of [Athena](../deities/athena.md)'s olive that "never fades."[^eur-ion-tokens]

When reunited, Ion asked bluntly whether Creusa was hiding a mortal lover behind Apollo's name. She swore by victorious [Athena](../deities/athena.md) that "no one of mortal race is father to thee, but he who brought thee up, the royal Phoebus."[^eur-ion-father]

### Destiny

[Athena](../deities/athena.md) appeared as deus ex machina and confirmed Apollo's paternity. She prophesied that from Ion's line "four sons shall spring" — Geleon, Hopletes, Argades, and Aegicores — who would name the four Athenian tribes. His descendants would colonise the Aegean islands and both continents, "and shall boast their name Ionians, from the honour'd Ion call'd."[^eur-ion-destiny]

### Character

Ion is notable for his moral seriousness — he openly criticises the gods for behaving unjustly, arguing that if gods punish mortals for crimes, they should hold themselves to the same standard: "if to mortals you shall pay the penalty of forced embraces, thou, Neptune, and Jove, that reigns supreme in heaven, will leave your temples treasureless."[^eur-ion-critique] He is also surprisingly reluctant about political power, preferring his quiet temple life to Athenian kingship.

[^eur-ion-orphan]: "A mother's fondness, and a father's care I never knew: the temple of the god claims then my service, for it nurtured me" (Ion, trans. Robert Potter)
[^eur-ion-sire]: "Phoebus is to me a sire; grateful thoughts my soul inspire; nurtured by thy bounty here, thee, Apollo, I revere; as a father's I repeat" (Ion, trans. Robert Potter)
[^eur-ion-humble]: "Be mine the humble blessings of private life, rather than be a king, from the flagitious forced to choose my friends, and hate the virtuous through the fear of death" (Ion, trans. Robert Potter)
[^eur-ion-tokens]: "A Gorgon central in the warp enwoven... and like an aegis edged with serpents round... Two dragons, an old work, their jaws of gold... A branch of olive then I wreathed around thee, pluck'd from that tree which from Minerva's rock first sprung" (Ion, trans. Robert Potter)
[^eur-ion-father]: "No one of mortal race is father to thee, but he who brought thee up, the royal Phoebus" (Ion, trans. Robert Potter)
[^eur-ion-destiny]: "from his root four sons shall spring, that to the land, the tribes, the dwellers on my rock, shall give their names. Geleon the first, Hopletes, Argades, and from my aegis named Aegicores... and shall boast their name Ionians, from the honour'd Ion call'd" (Ion, trans. Robert Potter)
[^eur-ion-critique]: "if to mortals you shall pay the penalty of forced embraces, thou, Neptune, and Jove, that reigns supreme in heaven, will leave your temples treasureless by paying the mulcts of your injustice" (Ion, trans. Robert Potter)
