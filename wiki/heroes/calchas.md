## Overview

**Calchas** was the foremost seer among the Greeks during the [Trojan War](../events/trojan-war.md). He interpreted omens, declared the necessity of [Iphigenia](iphigenia.md)'s sacrifice at Aulis, prophesied that Troy would fall in ten years, and revealed that the war could not be won without [Achilles](achilles.md). He died after the war when he encountered the diviner Mopsus, who proved the wiser prophet.

## In the Iliad

Calchas is introduced as "Calchas son of Thestor, most excellent far of augurs, who knew both things that were and that should be and that had been before, and guided the ships of the Achaians to Ilios by his soothsaying that Phoebus Apollo bestowed on him."[^il1-intro]

In Book I, Calchas reveals to the Greek assembly that [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md)'s plague upon the army is caused by [Agamemnon](agamemnon.md)'s refusal to ransom Chryseis. Before speaking, he asks [Achilles](achilles.md) for protection: he knows "that he that is lord of all the Argives" will be angered by his prophecy.[^il1-protection]

## In the Bibliotheca

### Achilles Prophecy (3.13.8)

"When Achilles was nine years old, Calchas declared that Troy could not be taken without him."[^apd-achilles]

[^apd-achilles]: "When Achilles was nine years old, Calchas declared that Troy could not be taken without him" (Bibliotheca 3.13.8, trans. J.G. Frazer)

### The Serpent Omen at Aulis (E.3.15)

When the fleet assembled at Aulis, "a serpent darted from the altar beside the neighboring plane-tree, in which there was a nest; and having consumed the eight sparrows in the nest, together with the mother bird, which made the ninth, it was turned to stone. Calchas said that this sign was given them by the will of Zeus, and he inferred from what had happened that Troy was destined to be taken in a period of ten years."[^apd-serpent]

[^apd-serpent]: "a serpent darted from the altar beside the neighboring plane-tree, in which there was a nest; and having consumed the eight sparrows in the nest, together with the mother bird, which made the ninth, it was turned to stone. Calchas said that this sign was given them by the will of Zeus, and he inferred from what had happened that Troy was destined to be taken in a period of ten years" (Bibliotheca E.3.15, trans. J.G. Frazer)

### The Sacrifice of Iphigenia (E.3.21)

When the fleet was windbound at Aulis, "Calchas said that they could not sail unless the fairest of Agamemnon's daughters were presented as a sacrifice to [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md); for the goddess was angry with Agamemnon, both because, on shooting a deer, he had said, 'Artemis herself could not (do it better).'"[^apd-iphigenia]

[^apd-iphigenia]: "Calchas said that they could not sail unless the fairest of Agamemnon's daughters were presented as a sacrifice to Artemis; for the goddess was angry with Agamemnon, both because, on shooting a deer, he had said, 'Artemis herself could not (do it better)'" (Bibliotheca E.3.21, trans. J.G. Frazer)

### The Palladium Prophecy (E.5.8)

Late in the war, "Calchas prophesied to them that Troy could not be taken unless they had the bow and arrows of Hercules" and the Palladium.[^apd-palladium]

[^apd-palladium]: Bibliotheca E.5.8-10, trans. J.G. Frazer

### Death at Colophon (E.6.2-4)

After the war, Calchas journeyed by land to Colophon, "for it was foretold him that he would die if he met with a wiser diviner than himself." There he encountered Mopsus, son of [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) and Manto. Mopsus challenged Calchas with a riddle about a fig tree's fruit count, which he answered correctly. When Calchas asked about a pregnant sow, he answered "eight," but Mopsus corrected him: "not eight, as Calchas says, but nine, and that they are all male and will be farrowed without fail tomorrow at the sixth hour." When this proved true, "Calchas died of a broken heart and was buried at Notium."[^apd-death]

[^apd-death]: "Calchas died of a broken heart and was buried at Notium" (Bibliotheca E.6.2-4, trans. J.G. Frazer)

## In Aeschylus' Agamemnon

Calchas reads the omen of two eagles devouring a pregnant hare, interpreting it as a sign of Troy's fall but also a warning of [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md)'s anger — foreshadowing the sacrifice at Aulis.[^aesch-ag]

## In the Achilleid

When the Greek army assembles at Aulis and yearns for the absent [Achilles](achilles.md), [Protesilaus](protesilaus.md) rebukes Calchas, demanding he reveal where Achilles is hidden: "O son of Thestor, forgetful of Phoebus and thy own tripods, when wilt thou open thy god-possessed lips more surely, or why dost thou hide the secret things of Fate?"[^ach-rebuke]

Calchas is then seized by prophetic frenzy. Statius gives the most vivid description in ancient literature of the physical experience of divine possession:

> "Long since has the son of Thestor been glancing round about him with excited movements, and by his first pallor betrayed the incoming of the god; soon he rolls fiery, bloodshot eyes, seeing neither his comrades nor the camp, but blind and absent from the scene he now overhears the mighty councils of gods in the upper air, now accosts the prescient birds, now the stern sisters' threads, now anxiously consults the incense-laden altars, and quickly scans the shooting flames and feeds upon the sacred vapours. His hair streams out, and the fillet totters on his stiffened locks, his head rolls and he staggers in his gait."[^ach-frenzy]

When the vision breaks through, Calchas reveals both [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md)'s deception and Achilles' location on [Scyros](../places/scyros.md): "Whither bearest thou, O Nereid, by thy woman's guile great Chiron's mighty pupil? Send him hither: why dost thou carry him away? I will not suffer it: mine is he, mine!" He sees Thetis "all bewildered among the Cyclades, in base stealth seeking out the coast" and cries: "The accomplice land of Lycomedes finds favour. Ah! horrid deed! see, flowing garments drape his breast. Rend them, boy, rend them, and yield not to thy timid mother."[^ach-vision]

After the vision, "tottering he ceased, the madness lost its force, and with a shudder he collapsed and fell before the altar." His prophecy sends [Odysseus](odysseus.md) and [Diomedes](diomedes.md) to Scyros to retrieve Achilles.[^ach-collapse]

[^ach-rebuke]: "O son of Thestor, forgetful of Phoebus and thy own tripods, when wilt thou open thy god-possessed lips more surely, or why dost thou hide the secret things of Fate?" (Achilleid 1.493-498, trans. J.H. Mozley)

[^ach-collapse]: "tottering he ceased, the madness lost its force, and with a shudder he collapsed and fell before the altar" (Achilleid 1.536-537)
