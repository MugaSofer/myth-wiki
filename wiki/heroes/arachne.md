## Overview

**Arachne** was a mortal weaver of Lydia whose skill rivalled [Athena](../deities/athena.md)'s (Minerva's). After defeating the goddess in a weaving contest, she was transformed into a spider.

## In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md)

### Arachne's Reputation (6.1-25)

Arachne was "a girl who had not fame for place of birth, nor fame for birth, but only fame for skill." Her father dyed wool in Phocean purples at Colophon. "Unnumbered curious nymphs eager to witness her dexterity, deserted the lush vineyards of Timolus" to watch her work.[^met-ar-fame] Her skill was so evident that "in all her motions one might well perceive how much Minerva had instructed her: but this she ever would deny, displeased to share her fame," and dared [Athena](../deities/athena.md) to a contest.[^met-ar-deny]

### The Challenge (6.26-52)

[Athena](../deities/athena.md) came disguised as an old woman and warned Arachne to seek pardon. Arachne replied: "Silly fool, worn out and witless in your palsied age... advise your goddess to come here herself, and not avoid the contest!"[^met-ar-insult] Athena revealed herself — the nymphs and matrons worshipped her, "but not Arachne, who defiant stood; although at first she flushed up — then went pale — then blushed again."[^met-ar-reveal]

### The Weaving (6.53-128)

Both wove with extraordinary speed and skill, using "myriad tints" that "inwoven, mingled in a thousand tints, harmonious and contrasting; shot with gold." Athena depicted her contest with [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) (Neptune) for Athens — herself with shield, lance, helmet, and [aegis](../objects/aegis.md), striking the earth to produce the olive tree. In the four corners, she wove cautionary scenes of mortals punished for rivalling gods.[^met-ar-minerva]

Arachne wove scenes of the gods' deceptions and seductions: [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) (Jupiter) as a bull with Europa, a swan with Leda, a shower of gold with Danae, a satyr with Antiope; [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) as a bull, a ram, a horse, a dolphin; [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) in various disguises; [Dionysus](../deities/dionysus.md) as grapes; and [Cronus](../deities/cronus.md) (Saturn) as a horse begetting Chiron. Her work was flawless — "Minerva could not find a fleck or flaw — even Envy can not censure perfect art."[^met-ar-arachne]

### Punishment and Transformation (6.129-145)

"Enraged because Arachne had such skill she ripped the web, and ruined all the scenes that showed those wicked actions of the Gods; and with her boxwood shuttle in her hand, struck the unhappy mortal on her head — struck sharply thrice, and even once again."[^met-ar-struck] Arachne hanged herself. Athena, "moved to pity at the sight, sustained and saved her from that bitter death; but, angry still, pronounced another doom": she sprinkled Arachne with the juice of Hecate's herbs. "At once all hair fell off, her nose and ears remained not, and her head shrunk rapidly in size, as well as all her body, leaving her diminutive. Her slender fingers gathered to her sides as long thin legs... and ever since, Arachne, as a spider, weaves her web."[^met-ar-spider]

[^met-ar-fame]: "a girl who had not fame for place of birth, nor fame for birth, but only fame for skill... unnumbered curious nymphs eager to witness her dexterity, deserted the lush vineyards of Timolus" (Metamorphoses 6.7-15, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-ar-deny]: "in all her motions one might well perceive how much Minerva had instructed her: but this she ever would deny, displeased to share her fame; and said, 'Let her contend in art with me'" (Metamorphoses 6.18-22)
[^met-ar-insult]: "Silly fool, worn out and witless in your palsied age, a great age is your great misfortune!... advise your goddess to come here herself, and not avoid the contest!" (Metamorphoses 6.39-47)
[^met-ar-reveal]: "Minerva comes to you! And with those brief words, put aside the shape of the old woman, and revealed herself... All the other Nymphs and matrons of Mygdonia worshiped her; but not Arachne, who defiant stood" (Metamorphoses 6.48-53)
[^met-ar-minerva]: "Minerva worked the Athenian Hill of Mars... and showed the old contention for the name it should be given. Twelve celestial Gods surrounded Jupiter, on lofty thrones" (Metamorphoses 6.70-77)
[^met-ar-arachne]: "Minerva could not find a fleck or flaw — even Envy can not censure perfect art" (Metamorphoses 6.129)
[^met-ar-struck]: "enraged because Arachne had such skill she ripped the web, and ruined all the scenes that showed those wicked actions of the Gods; and with her boxwood shuttle in her hand, struck the unhappy mortal on her head — struck sharply thrice, and even once again" (Metamorphoses 6.129-135)
[^met-ar-spider]: "At once all hair fell off, her nose and ears remained not, and her head shrunk rapidly in size, as well as all her body, leaving her diminutive. Her slender fingers gathered to her sides as long thin legs; and all her other parts were fast absorbed in her abdomen — whence she vented a fine thread; and ever since, Arachne, as a spider, weaves her web" (Metamorphoses 6.139-145)
