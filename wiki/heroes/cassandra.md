## Overview

**Cassandra** was a daughter of [Priam](priam.md) and [Hecuba](hecuba.md), a Trojan princess endowed with the gift of prophecy by [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md). When she refused Apollo's love, he cursed her so that her prophecies would never be believed. After the fall of [Troy](../places/troy.md), she was taken as a war-prize by [Agamemnon](agamemnon.md) and murdered alongside him by [Clytemnestra](clytemnestra.md).

## In the Iliad

Cassandra is mentioned briefly. She is "the first to see" Priam returning with the body of [Hector](hector.md) and raises the alarm from the heights of [Troy](../places/troy.md).[^il-cassandra]

## In the Odyssey

[Agamemnon](agamemnon.md)'s ghost tells [Odysseus](odysseus.md) that Clytemnestra slew Cassandra alongside him: she "slew Cassandra, daughter of Priam, over me," and Cassandra's dying cries rang in his ears.[^od-cassandra]

## In the Epic Cycle

In the *Sack of Ilium*, Ajax (the Locrian) violated Cassandra at [Athena](../deities/athena.md)'s altar during the fall of Troy. Apollodorus records the same: Ajax "rushed to the image of Athena, and found Cassandra clinging to the wooden image," and "by force dragged away the suppliant maiden together with the image."[^epic-ajax]

## In the Bibliotheca

[Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) records that Apollo "would have gained her favours" but she refused after receiving the prophetic gift. He cursed her so that "nobody should believe her prophecies."[^apd-curse] After Troy's fall, she was allotted to Agamemnon. On his return to Mycenae, "they killed Cassandra also."[^apd-murder]

## In the Fabulae

[Hyginus](../sources/hyginus.md) records the false report by Oiax (brother of [Palamedes](palamedes.md)) to [Clytemnestra](clytemnestra.md) "that Cassandra was being brought as a concubine to her house," which motivated Clytemnestra's murder plot. Clytemnestra and [Aegisthus](aegisthus.md) "killed him with an axe as he was sacrificing, and Cassandra, too."[^hyg-murder]

## In Pindar

Pindar names her "the maiden prophetess" (Pythian XI) and places her death alongside Agamemnon's at Amyklai.[^pindar-cass]

## In Aeschylus' Agamemnon

Cassandra has her most developed portrayal in the *[Agamemnon](../sources/aeschylus-agamemnon.md)*. She arrives in Argos as Agamemnon's war-prize, sitting silently in his chariot while Clytemnestra lays out the purple tapestries.

### Apollo's Curse

Left alone with the Chorus, Cassandra breaks into a visionary frenzy. She reveals the source of her curse: she had pledged herself to Apollo but then refused him. "I plighted troth, then foiled the god," she tells the Chorus, and as punishment, "no man believed me."[^ag-troth] She calls Apollo "the Destroyer"—a pun on his name.[^ag-destroyer]

### Visions of Past and Future

Cassandra's prophetic sight encompasses both the past horrors of the house and its coming doom. She sees the feast of [Thyestes](../heroes/thyestes.md): children sitting as ghosts, "their hands are full / Of their own flesh," served as meat by [Atreus](../heroes/atreus.md).[^ag-thyestes] She sees Agamemnon's imminent murder in the bath: "What is this new and ghastly sight? / A net, a net of hell" and "the snare is she who shared his bed."[^ag-net]

She also prophesies [Orestes](orestes.md)' return to avenge his father: "He, to avenge his father's blood outpoured, / Shall smite and slay with matricidal hand."[^ag-orestes]

### Going to Her Death

Knowing she will die, Cassandra willingly enters the palace. She addresses her own fate: "I too will brave my doom and face the gates of death," asking only that her killers receive just punishment.[^ag-doom] As she enters, she recoils at the smell of blood: "the smell of death: a charnel-breathing air / Of blood."[^ag-smell]

## In Euripides' Hecuba

In [Euripides](../sources/euripides-hecuba.md)' *Hecuba*, Cassandra is referenced as having been allotted to Agamemnon after Troy's fall. [Hecuba](hecuba.md) invokes her as one of the sources of her grief.[^eur-hec]
