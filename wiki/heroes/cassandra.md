## Overview

**Cassandra** was a daughter of [Priam](priam.md) and [Hecuba](hecuba.md), a Trojan princess endowed with the gift of prophecy by [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md). When she refused Apollo's love, he cursed her so that her prophecies would never be believed. After the fall of [Troy](../places/troy.md), she was taken as a war-prize by [Agamemnon](agamemnon.md) and murdered alongside him by [Clytemnestra](clytemnestra.md).

## In the Iliad

Cassandra is mentioned briefly. She is "the first to see" Priam returning with the body of [Hector](hector.md) and raises the alarm from the heights of [Troy](../places/troy.md).[^il-cassandra]

## In the Odyssey

[Agamemnon](agamemnon.md)'s ghost tells [Odysseus](odysseus.md) that Clytemnestra slew Cassandra alongside him: she "slew Cassandra, daughter of Priam, over me," and Cassandra's dying cries rang in his ears.[^od-cassandra]

## In the Epic Cycle

In the *Sack of Ilium*, Ajax (the Locrian) violated Cassandra at [Athena](../deities/athena.md)'s altar during the fall of Troy. Apollodorus records the same: Ajax "rushed to the image of Athena, and found Cassandra clinging to the wooden image," and "by force dragged away the suppliant maiden together with the image."[^epic-ajax]

## In the Bibliotheca

[Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) records that Apollo "would have gained her favours" but she refused after receiving the prophetic gift. He cursed her so that "nobody should believe her prophecies."[^apd-curse] After Troy's fall, she was allotted to Agamemnon. On his return to Mycenae, "they killed Cassandra also."[^apd-murder]

## In the Fabulae

[Hyginus](../sources/hyginus.md) records the false report by Oiax (brother of [Palamedes](palamedes.md)) to [Clytemnestra](clytemnestra.md) "that Cassandra was being brought as a concubine to her house," which motivated Clytemnestra's murder plot. Clytemnestra and [Aegisthus](aegisthus.md) "killed him with an axe as he was sacrificing, and Cassandra, too."[^hyg-murder]

## In Pindar

Pindar names her "the maiden prophetess" (Pythian XI) and places her death alongside Agamemnon's at Amyklai.[^pindar-cass]

## In Aeschylus' Agamemnon

Cassandra has her most developed portrayal in the *[Agamemnon](../sources/aeschylus-agamemnon.md)*. She arrives in Argos as Agamemnon's war-prize, sitting silently in his chariot while Clytemnestra lays out the purple tapestries.

### Apollo's Curse

Left alone with the Chorus, Cassandra breaks into a visionary frenzy. She reveals the source of her curse: she had pledged herself to Apollo but then refused him. "I plighted troth, then foiled the god," she tells the Chorus, and as punishment, "no man believed me."[^ag-troth] She calls Apollo "the Destroyer"—a pun on his name.[^ag-destroyer]

### Visions of Past and Future

Cassandra's prophetic sight encompasses both the past horrors of the house and its coming doom. She sees the feast of [Thyestes](../heroes/thyestes.md): children sitting as ghosts, "their hands are full / Of their own flesh," served as meat by [Atreus](../heroes/atreus.md).[^ag-thyestes] She sees Agamemnon's imminent murder in the bath: "What is this new and ghastly sight? / A net, a net of hell" and "the snare is she who shared his bed."[^ag-net]

She also prophesies [Orestes](orestes.md)' return to avenge his father: "He, to avenge his father's blood outpoured, / Shall smite and slay with matricidal hand."[^ag-orestes]

### Going to Her Death

Knowing she will die, Cassandra willingly enters the palace. She addresses her own fate: "I too will brave my doom and face the gates of death," asking only that her killers receive just punishment.[^ag-doom] As she enters, she recoils at the smell of blood: "the smell of death: a charnel-breathing air / Of blood."[^ag-smell]

## In Euripides' Hecuba

In [Euripides](../sources/euripides-hecuba.md)' *Hecuba*, Cassandra is referenced as having been allotted to Agamemnon after Troy's fall. [Hecuba](hecuba.md) invokes her as one of the sources of her grief.[^eur-hec]

## In the [Posthomerica](../sources/posthomerica.md)

### The Warning at the Wooden Horse (Book XII)

When the [Wooden Horse](../objects/wooden-horse.md) has been brought into [Troy](../places/troy.md) and the city fills with evil portents — victims that will not burn, blood-red smoke, weeping statues, quaking walls — Cassandra alone understands their meaning. Quintus describes her as the one clear-eyed heart in Troy, whose words were always true yet never believed: "One heart was steadfast, and one soul clear-eyed, / Cassandra. Never her words were unfulfilled; / Yet was their utter truth, by Fate's decree, / Ever as idle wind in the hearers' ears."[^post-xii-intro]

She rushes forth in prophetic frenzy, her physical state vividly rendered: "Over her snowy shoulders tossed her hair / Streaming far down, and wildly blazed her eyes. / Her neck writhed, like a sapling in the wind / Shaken."[^post-xii-appear] She cries out that Troy is passing into the Land of Darkness, that fire and blood and doom surround the city, and that the Trojans have brought their own ruin inside the walls with the Argive Horse: "Fools! ye know not your doom: still ye rejoice / With one consent in madness, who to Troy / Have brought the Argive Horse where ruin lurks!"[^post-xii-speech]

A Trojan voice mocks her, calling her a babbler of empty words, compassed with madness, lacking in maiden modesty.[^post-xii-mock] Others join in the ridicule and physically restrain her when she moves to act. She seizes a blazing pine-wood brand from a hearth and in the other hand takes a two-edged halberd, rushing at the Horse to expose the hidden ambush — but the Trojans snatch the fire and steel from her hands and drive her away.[^post-xii-attack] From inside the Horse, the Argives hear the commotion and marvel that she knows their purpose so well.[^post-xii-argives]

Quintus closes the scene with a simile: like a pantheress driven off by hounds and shepherds yet turning back in savage heart even as she departs, Cassandra flees from the Horse "anguish-racked / For Troy, for all the ruin she foreknew."[^post-xii-panther]

### The Sack of Troy (Book XIII)

During the sack, [Diomedes](diomedes.md) kills Coroebus, son of Mygdon, who had come to Troy hoping to win Cassandra as his bride: "Ah fool! the bride he won not, Priam's child / Cassandra, yea, his loveliest, for whose sake / To Priam's burg but yesterday he came."[^post-xiii-coroebus] The detail establishes that Cassandra was considered among the most beautiful of Priam's children.

Later, [Athena](../deities/athena.md) herself grieves — not for Troy, but for the outrage committed within her own temple: Ajax the Locrian, lust-maddened, violated Cassandra inside the goddess's shrine. "Within her fane / Outraged Cassandra was of Oileus son / Lust-maddened."[^post-xiii-ajax] Athena turns her face away from the sacrilege but does not act immediately, setting the stage for her wrath against the Greek fleet.

### Departure from Troy (Book XIV)

As the Greeks lead away their captives, Cassandra is explicitly named as Agamemnon's prize: "Cassandra heavenly-fair was haled the prize / Of Agamemnon."[^post-xiv-prize] On the ships, the Trojan women gaze at Cassandra with wonder, remembering her prophecy of doom; but she laughs at their tears in bitter scorn, in anguish for the ruin of her land.[^post-xiv-laugh]

In Book XIV [Athena](../deities/athena.md) complains to [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) about the outrage, specifying that Cassandra had stretched out her hands to the goddess repeatedly but Ajax did not heed her: "hath pitied not / Cassandra stretching unregarded hands / Once and again to me."[^post-xiv-athena] Zeus grants Athena permission to wreak vengeance on the Greek fleet.
