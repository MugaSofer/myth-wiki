## Overview

**Creon** was a Theban nobleman, brother of [Jocasta](../heroes/jocasta.md), who served as regent or king of [Thebes](../places/thebes.md) at various points in the city's troubled history. In the [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md), he offered the kingdom to whoever solved the [Sphinx](../creatures/sphinx.md)'s riddle. In Sophocles' trilogy, he develops from a reasonable counselor into a tyrannical ruler whose refusal to bury [Polyneices](../heroes/polyneices.md) leads to the destruction of his own family.

## In the Bibliotheca

When the Sphinx ravaged Thebes, Creon proclaimed "that he who should solve the riddle should receive the kingdom and the wife of Laius" (3.5.8).[^apd-sphinx] His own son Haemon was among those killed by the Sphinx.

After the [Seven against Thebes](../events/seven-against-thebes.md), Creon "refused to allow the dead to be buried" (3.7.1). When [Antigone](../heroes/antigone.md) was caught burying Polyneices secretly, Creon "interred her alive in the tomb" (3.7.1).[^apd-antigone]

## In the Fabulae

Hyginus records that after the Sphinx's arrival, Creon offered "the kingdom and his sister Jocasta in marriage to the person solving the riddle" (§67).[^hyg-creon]

## In Sophocles' Oedipus the King

Creon serves as a trusted adviser. [Oedipus](../heroes/oedipus.md) sends him to [Delphi](../places/delphi.md) to learn how to end the plague. He returns with [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md)'s answer: the murderer of Laius must be found and expelled. When Oedipus, influenced by [Teiresias](../heroes/tiresias.md)'s accusation, suspects Creon of conspiracy, Creon defends himself reasonably, arguing he has no motive to seize the throne since he already enjoys its privileges without its burdens.[^sot-defense]

After Oedipus's fall, Creon assumes authority and agrees to exile Oedipus, saying he must first consult the oracle. He brings Antigone and [Ismene](../heroes/ismene.md) to their father for a farewell.[^sot-authority]

## In Sophocles' Oedipus at Colonus

Creon appears as antagonist, sent to bring Oedipus back to Theban territory so the city can benefit from the oracle promising victory to whoever possesses his grave. When persuasion fails, he resorts to force, seizing Antigone and Ismene. [Theseus](../heroes/theseus.md) confronts and overrules him, rescuing the daughters. Oedipus denounces him: "Thou comest to steal me, not to take me home" (~783).[^soc-creon]

## In Sophocles' Antigone

Creon is the central figure. Having assumed the throne after the mutual fratricide of [Eteocles](../heroes/eteocles.md) and Polyneices, he decrees that Eteocles shall be buried with honor while Polyneices "must lie unwept, unsepulchred" (~29-30).[^sa-edict] He justifies this as service to the state: the loyal must be honored, the treasonous punished.

When Antigone is caught, Creon condemns her despite her appeal to divine law. He dismisses his son [Haemon](../heroes/haemon.md)'s pleas and [Teiresias](../heroes/tiresias.md)'s warnings. When Teiresias prophesies that Creon will "yield a son of thine own loins / In quittance, dead for dead" (~1065-1066), Creon finally relents — too late.[^sa-teiresias]

He arrives at the tomb to find Antigone hanged and Haemon clutching her body. Haemon spits in his father's face, swings his sword at Creon, misses, and turns it on himself. Creon's wife [Eurydice](../heroes/eurydice-creon.md), hearing the news, stabs herself at the altar, cursing Creon as "the slayer of thy sons" (~1305).[^sa-eurydice]

The Chorus delivers the final judgment: "Of happiness the chiefest part / Is wisdom, and to hold the gods in awe" (~1348-1349).[^sa-chorus]

## In Euripides' Phoenissae

Creon appears as adviser during the [Seven against Thebes](../events/seven-against-thebes.md). Teiresias prophesies that Creon's son Menoeceus must be sacrificed to save the city. Creon tries to save his son, but Menoeceus sacrifices himself willingly.[^phoen-menoeceus]
