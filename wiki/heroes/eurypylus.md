# Eurypylus

> "Beseems not with great swelling words to vaunt amidst the feast, and lavish promises, but rather quietly to eat in hall, and to devise deeds worthy."[^epigraph]

## Overview

**Eurypylus** was the son of Telephus and grandson of [Heracles](heracles.md), who came to [Troy](../places/troy.md) as the last great ally of [Priam](priam.md) after [Memnon](memnon.md)'s death. Leading a vast host of Ceteians (Mysians), he drove the Greeks behind their wall and nearly burned their ships, killing [Nireus](nireus.md) and [Machaon](machaon.md) among others. Only the arrival of [Neoptolemus](neoptolemus.md) turned the tide; the two met in a titanic duel, and Neoptolemus killed him with the Pelian lance through the throat. His shield bore images of all the labours of Heracles, his grandfather.

## In the Odyssey

[Odysseus](odysseus.md) mentions Eurypylus to [Achilles](achilles.md)' ghost when praising Neoptolemus: he "smote with the sword that son of Telephus, the hero Eurypylus, and many Ceteians of his company were slain around him, by reason of a woman's bribe. He truly was the comeliest man that ever I saw, next to goodly Memnon."[^od-eurypylus]

The "woman's bribe" is unexplained in Homer but later sources identify it as Priam's gift to Eurypylus's mother Astyoche.

## In the Posthomerica

### Arrival at Troy

After [Paris](paris.md) rejected Polydamas' counsel to return [Helen](helen.md), and Memnon and [Penthesilea](penthesilea.md) were both dead, [Priam](priam.md) urged the Trojans to wait for Eurypylus. He arrived with "a countless host of swarthy" Ceteians. [Menelaus](menelaus.md) tested the Greeks' resolve by proposing retreat, but [Diomedes](diomedes.md) rebuked him, and [Calchas](calchas.md) prophesied that Achilles' son would come.[^post-arrival]

### The Shield of Heracles

Eurypylus bore a shield depicting all the labours of his grandfather [Heracles](heracles.md) — the Nemean lion, the Lernaean [Hydra](../creatures/hydra.md), the Erymanthian boar, the Ceryneian hind, the Stymphalian birds, the Augean stables, the Cretan bull, the mares of Diomedes, Hippolyte's girdle, the cattle of Geryon, [Cerberus](../creatures/cerberus.md), and the apples of the Hesperides. The ekphrasis also showed Heracles' battle with the [Centaurs](../creatures/centaurs.md) and his apotheosis on Olympus.[^post-shield]

### Killing Nireus and Machaon

In battle, Eurypylus cut down many Greeks. He killed Nireus, who "in grace and goodlihead was like the Deathless Ones, yet was not strong in bodily might," and Machaon the healer. The Greeks buried both under one mound.[^post-nireus-machaon]

[Podaleirius](podaleirius.md), Machaon's brother, was devastated — he lay fasting on his brother's tomb and sought to kill himself, "now he clutched his sword, and now amidst his herbs sought for a deadly drug." Old [Nestor](nestor.md) consoled him, speaking of his own loss of [Antilochus](antilochus.md): "Endure thy sore grief, even as I endured, who lost a son, slain by the hands of foes."[^post-podaleirius]

### Driving the Greeks to the Ships

Eurypylus fought with a fury compared to Heracles himself on Pholoe against the Centaurs. He killed Peneleos and drove the Greeks behind their wall: "they had no heart to stand before Eurypylus, for Hercules, to crown with glory his son's stalwart son, thrilled them with panic." The Greeks cowered "as goats to leeward of a hill shrink from the wild cold rushing of the wind."[^post-rout]

Only Athena's intervention prevented him from burning the ships. He taunted the Greeks from before the wall: "Coward and dastard souls! no darts of yours had given me pause, nor thrust back from your ships, had not your rampart stayed mine onset-rush."[^post-taunt]

### Duel with Neoptolemus

When [Neoptolemus](neoptolemus.md) arrived and donned Achilles' arms, the Trojans thought Achilles had returned. The next morning, Neoptolemus rode forth in Achilles' chariot. Eurypylus and Neoptolemus met face to face. Eurypylus challenged: "Who art thou? Whence hast come to brave me here?" Neoptolemus replied: "Achilles' son am I, son of the man whose long spear smote thy sire, and made him flee," adding that Achilles had also healed Telephus "upon the brink of woeful death."[^post-challenge]

Eurypylus hurled a monstrous stone at Neoptolemus's shield, but "no whit staggered by its whirlwind rush, he like a giant mountain-foreland stood." They fought like lions, "both of the seed of Blessed Ones." From heaven, gods watched with divided sympathies. At last "the Pelian lance, sped onward by a mighty thrust, hath passed clear through Eurypylus' throat. Forth poured the blood torrent-like; through the portal of the wound the soul from the body flew: darkness of death dropped o'er his eyes." He fell "like stately pine or silver fir uprooted by the fury of Boreas."[^post-death]

### Burial

The Trojans honoured Eurypylus "even as Priam's sons." They buried him "apart from all the other slain, before the Gate Dardanian — where the streams of eddying Xanthus down from Ida flow."[^post-burial]

## In Other Sources

[Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) records that "Eurypylus, son of Telephus, arrived to fight for the Trojans, bringing a great force of Mysians. He performed doughty deeds, but was slain by Neoptolemus."[^apd]

[Hyginus](../sources/hyginus.md) lists the combat matchup: "Neoptolemus with Eurypylus; Eurypylus was killed."[^hyg]

The [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md)'s mention of "a woman's bribe" is explained by Apollodorus and other sources as Priam's gift of a golden vine to Astyoche (Eurypylus's mother, Priam's sister), persuading her to send her son to fight at Troy despite Telephus's dying wish that Eurypylus not go.
