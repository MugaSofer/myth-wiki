## Overview

**Erigone** was the daughter of [Aegisthus](aegisthus.md) and [Clytemnestra](clytemnestra.md), the pair who murdered [Agamemnon](../heroes/agamemnon.md) and seized the throne of [Mycenae](../places/mycenae.md). After [Orestes](../heroes/orestes.md) killed both his mother and her lover in revenge, Erigone pursued him through the courts, bringing him to trial for their murders.

## In the Bibliotheca

After [Orestes](../heroes/orestes.md) killed his mother and [Aegisthus](aegisthus.md), he was tried for the murders at Athens. "He is variously said to have been brought to trial by the Furies, or by Tyndareus, or by Erigone, daughter of Aegisthus and Clytaemnestra; and the votes at his trial being equal he was acquitted."[^apd-trial]

Later sources suggest that [Orestes](../heroes/orestes.md) himself married Erigone: "having himself married Hermione, or, according to some, Erigone, he begat Tisamenus, and was killed by the bite of a snake at Oresteum in Arcadia."[^apd-marriage]
