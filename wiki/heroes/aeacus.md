## Overview

**Aeacus** was the son of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) and the nymph [Aegina](aegina.md), born on the island that bears her name. He is renowned for his exceptional piety and justice, qualities that led to his deification. As grandfather of the great heroes [Achilles](achilles.md) and [Ajax](ajax.md), he became a legendary ancestor of the Greek warrior elite.

## In the Bibliotheca

When [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) brought [Aegina](aegina.md) to the island then called Oenone, "Zeus cohabited with her and begot a son Aeacus on her. As Aeacus was alone in the island, Zeus made the ants into men for him."[^apd-birth] Aeacus then "married Endeis, daughter of Sciron, by whom he had two sons, Peleus and Telamon."[^apd-marriage] He also "cohabited with Psamathe, daughter of Nereus, who turned herself into a seal to avoid his embraces, and he begot a son Phocus."[^apd-psamathe]

Aeacus became legendary for his virtue: "Now Aeacus was the most pious of men. Therefore, when Greece suffered from infertility on account of Pelops, because in a war with Stymphalus, king of the Arcadians, being unable to conquer Arcadia, he slew the king under a pretence of friendship, and scattered his mangled limbs, oracles of the gods declared that Greece would be rid of its present calamities if Aeacus would offer prayers on its behalf. So Aeacus did offer prayers, and Greece was delivered from the dearth."[^apd-piety]

Even after his death, "Aeacus is honored in the abode of Pluto, and keeps the keys of Hades."[^apd-hades]

### Succession and Conflict

When Phocus proved exceptionally skilled in athletics, "his brothers Peleus and Telamon plotted against him, and the lot falling on Telamon, he killed his brother in a match by throwing a quoit at his head, and with the help of Peleus carried the body and hid it in a wood. But the murder being detected, the two were driven fugitives from Aegina by Aeacus."[^apd-fratricide]
