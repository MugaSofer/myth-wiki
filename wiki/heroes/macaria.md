## Overview

**Macaria** was a daughter of [Heracles](heracles.md) who voluntarily sacrificed herself so that Athens could defeat [Eurystheus](eurystheus.md) and protect her brothers. Her name was not preserved in the manuscript of Euripides' play but was supplied from mythographers.

## In Euripides' Heraclidae

When oracles demand the sacrifice of a noble-born virgin to "the daughter of Ceres" ([Persephone](../deities/persephone.md)) as a condition for Athenian victory over [Eurystheus](eurystheus.md), Demophoon refuses to sacrifice his own child or any citizen's. Macaria overhears and comes forward, first apologizing for her boldness: "do not impute boldness to me because of my advances; for silence and modesty are best for a woman, and to remain quietly in-doors."[^eur-hcl-modesty]

She volunteers without hesitation: "I myself, old man, before I am commanded, am prepared to die, and to stand for slaughter." She argues that it would be cowardly for suppliants to let others face danger on their behalf: "it would be ridiculous for suppliants sitting at the shrines of the Gods to mourn, but being of such a sire as we are, to be seen to be cowards."[^eur-hcl-volunteer]

When [Iolaus](iolaus.md) suggests casting lots among the sisters, Macaria refuses, insisting her sacrifice must be entirely voluntary: "I will not die, obtaining the lot by chance, for then there are no thanks; but if you accept me, and are willing to use me willing, I readily give up my life to them, but not, being compelled."[^eur-hcl-lots]

Iolaus praises her: "you surpass daring by daring, and good words by good words." Iolaus also calls her "the seed of a divine mind," sprung from [Heracles](heracles.md).[^eur-hcl-praise]

She asks to die at the hands of women rather than men, bids farewell to her brothers, and reflects on the uncertainty of the afterlife: "if indeed there be aught under the earth. May there indeed be nothing; for if we, mortals who die, are to have cares even there, I know not where one can turn, for to die is considered the greatest remedy for evils."[^eur-hcl-farewell]
