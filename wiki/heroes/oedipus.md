# Oedipus

King of **[Thebes](../places/thebes.md)**, son of Laius and Jocasta (or Epicasta). Oedipus unknowingly killed his father and married his mother, fulfilling the oracle that Laius had tried to avert.

## In the Bibliotheca (3.5.7-3.5.9)

### Birth and Exposure

The oracle warned Laius not to beget a son, for the child would kill his father. Nevertheless, "flushed with wine, he had intercourse with his wife."[^apd-oedipus-oracle] When the babe was born, Laius pierced the child's ankles with brooches and gave it to a herdsman to expose on Cithaeron. The neatherds of Polybus, king of Corinth, found the infant and brought it to his wife Periboea, who adopted him and healed his ankles. She named him Oedipus "on account of his swollen feet."[^apd-oedipus-birth]

### The Parricide

When the boy excelled his fellows in strength, they taunted him with being supposititious. He went to Delphi and inquired about his true parents. The god told him not to go to his native land, "because he would murder his father and lie with his mother."[^apd-oedipus-delphi] Believing himself the son of Polybus, he left Corinth. Riding in a chariot through Phocis, he met Laius in a narrow road. When Laius's herald Polyphontes ordered Oedipus to make way and killed one of his horses, Oedipus in a rage killed both Polyphontes and Laius.[^apd-oedipus-kills-laius]

### The Sphinx and the Throne

In his reign, **[Hera](../deities/hera.md)** sent the **[Sphinx](../creatures/sphinx.md)** — whose mother was **[Echidna](../creatures/echidna.md)** and father **[Typhoeus](../creatures/typhoeus.md)**, with the face of a woman, the breast and feet and tail of a lion, and the wings of a bird. She sat on Mount Phicium and propounded her riddle: "What is that which has one voice and yet becomes four-footed and two-footed and three-footed?"[^apd-sphinx-riddle] When many had perished, including Creon's son Haemon, Creon proclaimed that whoever solved the riddle would receive the kingdom and the wife of Laius.

Oedipus declared the answer was man — "as a babe he is four-footed, going on four limbs, as an adult he is two-footed, and as an old man he gets besides a third support in a staff." The Sphinx threw herself from the citadel.[^apd-oedipus-sphinx]

### The Incest and Fall

Oedipus succeeded to the kingdom and unknowingly married his mother, begetting sons Polynices and Eteocles and daughters Ismene and **Antigone** — though some say the children were borne by Eurygania, daughter of Hyperphas.[^apd-oedipus-marriage]

When the secret came to light, Jocasta hanged herself. Oedipus put out his eyes and cursed his sons, "who saw him cast out of the city without lifting a hand to help him." With Antigone he came to Colonus in Attica, where the precinct of the Eumenides stands, sat as a suppliant, was kindly received by **[Theseus](../heroes/theseus.md)**, and died not long afterwards.[^apd-oedipus-end]

## In the Fabulae

### Laius and the Exposure (§66)

Hyginus gives a streamlined account of Oedipus's birth: "The oracle of Apollo warned Laius, son of Labdacus, that he should beware of death at his son's hands, and so when his wife Jocasta bore a son, he ordered him to be exposed."[^hyg66-oracle] The infant was found not by herdsmen on the mountain but by "Periboea, wife of King Polybus" who "found the child as she was washing garments at the shore, and rescued him."[^hyg66-found] The name Oedipus comes from his injury: "because he had pierced feet they named him Oidipus."[^hyg66-name]

[^hyg66-oracle]: "The oracle of Apollo warned Laius, son of Labdacus, that he should beware of death at his son's hands, and so when his wife Jocasta bore a son, he ordered him to be exposed" (Fabulae §66, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg66-found]: "Periboea, wife of King Polybus, found the child as she was washing garments at the shore, and rescued him. With Polybus' consent, since they were childless, they brought him up as their son" (Fabulae §66, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg66-name]: "and because he had pierced feet they named him Oidipus" (Fabulae §66, trans. Mary Grant)

### The Full Story (§67)

The Fabulae provides extensive narrative detail. Oedipus's discovery of the truth came through taunts: "After Oidipus, son of Laeius and Jocasta, had come to manhood, he was courageous beyond the rest, and through envy his companions taunted him with not being Polybus' son, since Polybus was so mild, and he so assertive. Oidipus felt that the taunt was true."[^hyg67-taunt]

The parricide occurred differently than in Apollodorus: "When he was going to Delphi, Oidipus met him, and when servants bade him give way to the King, he refused. The King urged on his horses, and a wheel grazed Oidipus' foot. Enraged, he dragged his father from the chariot, not knowing who he was, and killed him."[^hyg67-murder]

The Sphinx's riddle is given verbatim: "She proposed a contest to Creon, that if anyone interpreted the riddle which she gave, she would depart, but that she would destroy whoever failed."[^hyg67-contest] Creon's proclamation promised "that he would give the kingdom and his sister Jocasta in marriage to the person solving the riddle of the Sphinx."[^hyg67-prize]

A unique detail involves Menoeceus: "Meanwhile barrenness of crops and want fell on [Thebes](../places/thebes.md) because of the crimes of Oidipus, and Tiresias, questioned as to why Thebes was so harassed, replied that if anyone from the dragon's blood survived and died for his country, he would free Thebes from plague. Then Menoeceus [father of Jocasta] threw himself from the walls."[^hyg67-menoeceus]

The revelation comes through combined sources: "But Periboea revealed his adoption, and Menoetes, too, the old man who had exposed him, recognized him as the son of Laius by the scars on his feet and ankles."[^hyg67-recognition]

[^hyg67-taunt]: "After Oidipus, son of Laeius and Jocasta, had come to manhood, he was courageous beyond the rest, and through envy his companions taunted him with not being Polybus' son, since Polybus was so mild, and he so assertive. Oidipus felt that the taunt was true" (Fabulae §67, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg67-murder]: "When he was going to Delphi, Oidipus met him, and when servants bade him give way to the King, he refused. The King urged on his horses, and a wheel grazed Oidipus' foot. Enraged, he dragged his father from the chariot, not knowing who he was, and killed him" (Fabulae §67, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg67-contest]: "She proposed a contest to Creon, that if anyone interpreted the riddle which she gave, she would depart, but that she would destroy whoever failed, and under no other circumstances would she leave the country" (Fabulae §67, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg67-prize]: "When the king heard this, he made a proclamation throughout Greece. He promised that he would give the kingdom and his sister Jocasta in marriage to the person solving the riddle of the Sphinx" (Fabulae §67, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg67-menoeceus]: "Meanwhile barrenness of crops and want fell on Thebes because of the crimes of Oidipus, and Tiresias, questioned as to why Thebes was so harassed, replied that if anyone from the dragon's blood survived and died for his country, he would free Thebes from plague. Then Menoeceus [father of Jocasta] threw himself from the walls" (Fabulae §67, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg67-recognition]: "But Periboea revealed his adoption, and Menoetes, too, the old man who had exposed him, recognized him as the son of Laius by the scars on his feet and ankles. When Oidipus heard this and realized he had committed such atrocious crimes, he tore the brooches from his mother's garment and blinded himself" (Fabulae §67, trans. Mary Grant)
