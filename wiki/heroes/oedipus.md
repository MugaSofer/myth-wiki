# Oedipus

King of **[Thebes](../places/thebes.md)**, son of Laius and Jocasta (or Epicasta). Oedipus unknowingly killed his father and married his mother, fulfilling the oracle that Laius had tried to avert.

## In the Bibliotheca (3.5.7-3.5.9)

### Birth and Exposure

The oracle warned Laius not to beget a son, for the child would kill his father. Nevertheless, "flushed with wine, he had intercourse with his wife."[^apd-oedipus-oracle] When the babe was born, Laius pierced the child's ankles with brooches and gave it to a herdsman to expose on Cithaeron. The neatherds of Polybus, king of Corinth, found the infant and brought it to his wife Periboea, who adopted him and healed his ankles. She named him Oedipus "on account of his swollen feet."[^apd-oedipus-birth]

### The Parricide

When the boy excelled his fellows in strength, they taunted him with being supposititious. He went to Delphi and inquired about his true parents. The god told him not to go to his native land, "because he would murder his father and lie with his mother."[^apd-oedipus-delphi] Believing himself the son of Polybus, he left Corinth. Riding in a chariot through Phocis, he met Laius in a narrow road. When Laius's herald Polyphontes ordered Oedipus to make way and killed one of his horses, Oedipus in a rage killed both Polyphontes and Laius.[^apd-oedipus-kills-laius]

### The Sphinx and the Throne

In his reign, **[Hera](../deities/hera.md)** sent the **[Sphinx](../creatures/sphinx.md)** — whose mother was **[Echidna](../creatures/echidna.md)** and father **[Typhoeus](../creatures/typhoeus.md)**, with the face of a woman, the breast and feet and tail of a lion, and the wings of a bird. She sat on Mount Phicium and propounded her riddle: "What is that which has one voice and yet becomes four-footed and two-footed and three-footed?"[^apd-sphinx-riddle] When many had perished, including Creon's son Haemon, Creon proclaimed that whoever solved the riddle would receive the kingdom and the wife of Laius.

Oedipus declared the answer was man — "as a babe he is four-footed, going on four limbs, as an adult he is two-footed, and as an old man he gets besides a third support in a staff." The Sphinx threw herself from the citadel.[^apd-oedipus-sphinx]

### The Incest and Fall

Oedipus succeeded to the kingdom and unknowingly married his mother, begetting sons Polynices and Eteocles and daughters Ismene and **Antigone** — though some say the children were borne by Eurygania, daughter of Hyperphas.[^apd-oedipus-marriage]

When the secret came to light, Jocasta hanged herself. Oedipus put out his eyes and cursed his sons, "who saw him cast out of the city without lifting a hand to help him." With Antigone he came to Colonus in Attica, where the precinct of the Eumenides stands, sat as a suppliant, was kindly received by **[Theseus](../heroes/theseus.md)**, and died not long afterwards.[^apd-oedipus-end]

## In the Fabulae

### Laius and the Exposure (§66)

Hyginus gives a streamlined account of Oedipus's birth: "The oracle of Apollo warned Laius, son of Labdacus, that he should beware of death at his son's hands, and so when his wife Jocasta bore a son, he ordered him to be exposed."[^hyg66-oracle] The infant was found not by herdsmen on the mountain but by "Periboea, wife of King Polybus" who "found the child as she was washing garments at the shore, and rescued him."[^hyg66-found] The name Oedipus comes from his injury: "because he had pierced feet they named him Oidipus."[^hyg66-name]

[^hyg66-oracle]: "The oracle of Apollo warned Laius, son of Labdacus, that he should beware of death at his son's hands, and so when his wife Jocasta bore a son, he ordered him to be exposed" (Fabulae §66, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg66-found]: "Periboea, wife of King Polybus, found the child as she was washing garments at the shore, and rescued him. With Polybus' consent, since they were childless, they brought him up as their son" (Fabulae §66, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg66-name]: "and because he had pierced feet they named him Oidipus" (Fabulae §66, trans. Mary Grant)

### The Full Story (§67)

The Fabulae provides extensive narrative detail. Oedipus's discovery of the truth came through taunts: "After Oidipus, son of Laeius and Jocasta, had come to manhood, he was courageous beyond the rest, and through envy his companions taunted him with not being Polybus' son, since Polybus was so mild, and he so assertive. Oidipus felt that the taunt was true."[^hyg67-taunt]

The parricide occurred differently than in Apollodorus: "When he was going to Delphi, Oidipus met him, and when servants bade him give way to the King, he refused. The King urged on his horses, and a wheel grazed Oidipus' foot. Enraged, he dragged his father from the chariot, not knowing who he was, and killed him."[^hyg67-murder]

The Sphinx's riddle is given verbatim: "She proposed a contest to Creon, that if anyone interpreted the riddle which she gave, she would depart, but that she would destroy whoever failed."[^hyg67-contest] Creon's proclamation promised "that he would give the kingdom and his sister Jocasta in marriage to the person solving the riddle of the Sphinx."[^hyg67-prize]

A unique detail involves Menoeceus: "Meanwhile barrenness of crops and want fell on [Thebes](../places/thebes.md) because of the crimes of Oidipus, and Tiresias, questioned as to why Thebes was so harassed, replied that if anyone from the dragon's blood survived and died for his country, he would free Thebes from plague. Then Menoeceus [father of Jocasta] threw himself from the walls."[^hyg67-menoeceus]

The revelation comes through combined sources: "But Periboea revealed his adoption, and Menoetes, too, the old man who had exposed him, recognized him as the son of Laius by the scars on his feet and ankles."[^hyg67-recognition]

[^hyg67-taunt]: "After Oidipus, son of Laeius and Jocasta, had come to manhood, he was courageous beyond the rest, and through envy his companions taunted him with not being Polybus' son, since Polybus was so mild, and he so assertive. Oidipus felt that the taunt was true" (Fabulae §67, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg67-murder]: "When he was going to Delphi, Oidipus met him, and when servants bade him give way to the King, he refused. The King urged on his horses, and a wheel grazed Oidipus' foot. Enraged, he dragged his father from the chariot, not knowing who he was, and killed him" (Fabulae §67, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg67-contest]: "She proposed a contest to Creon, that if anyone interpreted the riddle which she gave, she would depart, but that she would destroy whoever failed, and under no other circumstances would she leave the country" (Fabulae §67, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg67-prize]: "When the king heard this, he made a proclamation throughout Greece. He promised that he would give the kingdom and his sister Jocasta in marriage to the person solving the riddle of the Sphinx" (Fabulae §67, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg67-menoeceus]: "Meanwhile barrenness of crops and want fell on Thebes because of the crimes of Oidipus, and Tiresias, questioned as to why Thebes was so harassed, replied that if anyone from the dragon's blood survived and died for his country, he would free Thebes from plague. Then Menoeceus [father of Jocasta] threw himself from the walls" (Fabulae §67, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg67-recognition]: "But Periboea revealed his adoption, and Menoetes, too, the old man who had exposed him, recognized him as the son of Laius by the scars on his feet and ankles. When Oidipus heard this and realized he had committed such atrocious crimes, he tore the brooches from his mother's garment and blinded himself" (Fabulae §67, trans. Mary Grant)

## In Sophocles' Oedipus the King

### The Plague and the Oracle

The play opens with [Thebes](../places/thebes.md) in the grip of a devastating plague. Oedipus, addressed as "world-renowned king" (8), has already sent [Creon](../heroes/creon.md) to [Delphi](../places/delphi.md). Creon returns with [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md)'s answer: the plague is caused by the unpunished murder of [Laius](../heroes/laius.md), and the killer must be driven out.[^sot-plague] Oedipus pronounces a solemn curse on the unknown murderer: "Wretch, may he pine in utter wretchedness!" and adds, "for myself, if with my privity / He gain admittance to my hearth, I pray / The curse I laid on others fall on me."[^sot-curse]

### Teiresias's Accusation

[Teiresias](../heroes/tiresias.md), summoned to help, at first refuses to speak. Goaded by Oedipus's anger, he declares: "Thou art the man, / Thou the accursed polluter of this land" (~353-354).[^sot-teiresias] He prophesies that the killer "shall be proved / Father and brother both of his own children, / Of her who bare him son and husband both, / Co-partner and assassin of his sire" (~457-460).[^sot-teiresias-prophecy] Oedipus accuses Teiresias and Creon of conspiracy, dismissing the prophet as a fraud.

### Jocasta's Revelation

[Jocasta](../heroes/jocasta.md) intervenes to make peace, and inadvertently triggers Oedipus's suspicion by mentioning that Laius was killed "at a spot where three roads meet" (~716).[^sot-crossroads] Oedipus recalls killing a man at such a place. He recounts his history: raised in Corinth as son of Polybus and Merope, taunted at a feast about his parentage, he went to Delphi where "Loxias once foretold / That I should mate with mine own mother, and shed / With my own hands the blood of my own sire" (~944-946).[^sot-oracle] Fleeing Corinth, he met a man in a chariot at the crossroads and killed him.

### Discovery of the Truth

A messenger from Corinth announces Polybus's natural death, seeming to disprove the oracle. But the messenger reveals that Oedipus was not Polybus's son — the messenger himself received the infant from a Theban herdsman on [Cithaeron](../places/cithaeron.md). Oedipus's name is traced to his injury: "thy ankles should attest" (~1032).[^sot-name] Jocasta, understanding the full truth, begs Oedipus to stop his inquiry and flees. The old herdsman confirms he gave the child of Laius to the Corinthian to save it, "for it was foretold that he should slay his sire" (~1175).[^sot-herdsman]

### The Blinding

A second messenger reports that Jocasta has hanged herself. Oedipus "tore the golden brooches that upheld / Her queenly robes, upraised them high and smote / Full on his eye-balls," crying: "No more shall ye behold such sights of woe, / Deeds I have suffered and myself have wrought; / Henceforward quenched in darkness shall ye see / Those ye should ne'er have seen; now blind to those / Whom, when I saw, I vainly yearned to know."[^sot-blinding] The blinded Oedipus appears, lamenting. He begs Creon to exile him and to care for his daughters [Antigone](../heroes/antigone.md) and [Ismene](../heroes/ismene.md).

The Chorus concludes: "Therefore, look to the end, and count no mortal blest / Until he pass the goal of suffering without a tear" (~1528-1530).[^sot-chorus-end]

## In Sophocles' Oedipus at Colonus

### Arrival at the Grove

The blind Oedipus, led by [Antigone](../heroes/antigone.md), arrives at Colonus near [Athens](../places/athens.md) and sits within the sacred grove of the [Eumenides](../creatures/erinyes.md). He recognizes the place from Apollo's oracle: "for when he foretold my many woes / He told me also of a resting-place, / After long years, in some land far remote — / A seat at the shrine of the Dread Goddesses" (~87-90).[^soc-oracle]

### Defense of His Innocence

When the Chorus recoils at his identity, Oedipus defends himself: "in act I sinned not, all was done / Unwittingly" (~267-268), and "I slew a man who sought to take my life, / Pure in the eye of law, void of intent" (~271-273).[^soc-defense]

### The Oracle and Theseus's Protection

[Ismene](../heroes/ismene.md) arrives with news that the oracle now declares whichever side possesses Oedipus's grave will prevail in the coming war between his sons. [Theseus](../heroes/theseus.md), king of Athens, offers refuge. Oedipus promises that his buried body will be a blessing for Athens: "Then shall my sleeping and long-buried corpse, / Cold in death, drink their warm life-blood" (~621-622) — a defense against future Theban invasion.[^soc-gift]

### Creon's Attempt

Creon arrives with armed men, seizes Antigone and Ismene by force, and tries to compel Oedipus to return. Theseus intervenes and rescues the daughters. Oedipus denounces Creon: "Thou comest to steal me, not to take me home" (~783).[^soc-creon]

### The Curse on Polyneices

[Polyneices](../heroes/polyneices.md) comes seeking his father's support for his campaign against Thebes with the [Seven](../events/seven-against-thebes.md). Oedipus delivers a devastating curse: "That city thou canst never storm, but first / Shall fall, thou and thy brother, blood-imbrued" (~5845-5846). He disowns his sons utterly: "Didst thou not drive me, thine own father, out, / An exile, cityless" (~5827-5828), while praising his daughters: "They tend me, they preserve me, they are men / Not women in true service to their sire; / But ye are bastards, and no sons of mine" (~5838-5840). His final curse: "Never to win by arms thy native land, / No, nor return to Argos in the Vale, / But by a kinsman's hand to die and slay / Him who expelled thee" (~1383-1386).[^soc-curse]

### Mysterious Death

Thunder sounds — [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md)'s summons. Oedipus, now guiding rather than guided, walks toward his death. He calls his daughters and "Folded his arms about them both and said, / 'My children, ye will lose your sire today... / yet one word / Wipes out all score of tribulations—_love_'" (~6238-6242).[^soc-farewell] A voice summoned him: "Oedipus, Oedipus, why tarry we? / Too long, too long thy passing is delayed" (~6252-6253).[^soc-voice] Only Theseus witnessed the end: "whether he were rapt away by gods / Or the earth's base opened to receive him, / None may tell but Theseus... / without wailing or disease or pain / He passed away—an end most marvelous" (~6280-6286).[^soc-death]
