# Oedipus

King of **[Thebes](../places/thebes.md)**, son of Laius and Jocasta (or Epicasta). Oedipus unknowingly killed his father and married his mother, fulfilling the oracle that Laius had tried to avert.

## In the Bibliotheca (3.5.7-3.5.9)

### Birth and Exposure

The oracle warned Laius not to beget a son, for the child would kill his father. Nevertheless, "flushed with wine, he had intercourse with his wife."[^apd-oedipus-oracle] When the babe was born, Laius pierced the child's ankles with brooches and gave it to a herdsman to expose on Cithaeron. The neatherds of Polybus, king of Corinth, found the infant and brought it to his wife Periboea, who adopted him and healed his ankles. She named him Oedipus "on account of his swollen feet."[^apd-oedipus-birth]

### The Parricide

When the boy excelled his fellows in strength, they taunted him with being supposititious. He went to Delphi and inquired about his true parents. The god told him not to go to his native land, "because he would murder his father and lie with his mother."[^apd-oedipus-delphi] Believing himself the son of Polybus, he left Corinth. Riding in a chariot through Phocis, he met Laius in a narrow road. When Laius's herald Polyphontes ordered Oedipus to make way and killed one of his horses, Oedipus in a rage killed both Polyphontes and Laius.[^apd-oedipus-kills-laius]

### The Sphinx and the Throne

In his reign, **[Hera](../deities/hera.md)** sent the **[Sphinx](../creatures/sphinx.md)** — whose mother was **[Echidna](../creatures/echidna.md)** and father **[Typhoeus](../creatures/typhoeus.md)**, with the face of a woman, the breast and feet and tail of a lion, and the wings of a bird. She sat on Mount Phicium and propounded her riddle: "What is that which has one voice and yet becomes four-footed and two-footed and three-footed?"[^apd-sphinx-riddle] When many had perished, including Creon's son Haemon, Creon proclaimed that whoever solved the riddle would receive the kingdom and the wife of Laius.

Oedipus declared the answer was man — "as a babe he is four-footed, going on four limbs, as an adult he is two-footed, and as an old man he gets besides a third support in a staff." The Sphinx threw herself from the citadel.[^apd-oedipus-sphinx]

### The Incest and Fall

Oedipus succeeded to the kingdom and unknowingly married his mother, begetting sons Polynices and Eteocles and daughters Ismene and **Antigone** — though some say the children were borne by Eurygania, daughter of Hyperphas.[^apd-oedipus-marriage]

When the secret came to light, Jocasta hanged herself. Oedipus put out his eyes and cursed his sons, "who saw him cast out of the city without lifting a hand to help him." With Antigone he came to Colonus in Attica, where the precinct of the Eumenides stands, sat as a suppliant, was kindly received by **[Theseus](../heroes/theseus.md)**, and died not long afterwards.[^apd-oedipus-end]
