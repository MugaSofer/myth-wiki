## Overview

**Agamemnon** is the king of Mycenae and commander-in-chief of the Greek expedition against [Troy](../places/troy.md). His house is cursed through the crimes of his ancestors — [Tantalus](../sources/apollodorus.md), [Pelops](../sources/apollodorus.md), and Atreus — and his own story ends in murder at the hands of his wife and her lover.

## In the Bibliotheca

### Parentage and Rise to Power (3.2.1-2, E.2.10-16)

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) gives Agamemnon's descent through the House of Atreus. Catreus, son of [Minos](minos.md), "gave Aerope and Clymene to Nauplius to sell into foreign lands; and of these two Aerope became the wife of Plisthenes, who begat Agamemnon and Menelaus."[^apd-parentage]

Atreus and his brother Thyestes struggled for the throne of Mycenae. When Thyestes seduced Aerope and gained the golden lamb, [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) "sent [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md) to Atreus and told him to stipulate with Thyestes that Atreus should be king if the sun should go backward; and when Thyestes agreed, the sun set in the east."[^apd-sun] Atreus then took terrible revenge, slaughtering Thyestes' sons and serving them to their father at a feast.[^apd-feast]

After Atreus was killed by Aegisthus (Thyestes' son by his own daughter), "the nurse took Agamemnon and Menelaus to Polyphides, lord of Sicyon." Eventually Tyndareus restored them, "and they drove away Thyestes to dwell in Cytheria."[^apd-restored] Agamemnon married Clytaemnestra "after he had slain her spouse Tantalus, the son of Thyestes, together with his newborn babe."[^apd-marriage]

### The Trojan War (E.3.1-E.5.23)

When [Alexander](../sources/apollodorus.md) (Paris) carried off [Helen](helen.md), "Menelaus came to Agamemnon at Mycenae, and begged him to muster an army against Troy and to raise levies in Greece." Agamemnon "in person was in command of the whole army" and brought a hundred ships from Mycenae.[^apd-command]

At Aulis, [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md) demanded the sacrifice of his daughter Iphigenia, "for the goddess was angry with Agamemnon, both because, on shooting a deer, he had said, 'Artemis herself could not (do it better),' and because Atreus had not sacrificed to her the golden lamb." Agamemnon sent for Iphigenia on the pretext of marrying her to [Achilles](achilles.md), "and was about to slaughter her, when Artemis carried her off to the Taurians and appointed her to be her priestess, substituting a deer for her at the altar."[^apd-iphigenia]

### Murder and Aftermath (E.6.23-28)

"After Agamemnon had returned to Mycenae with Cassandra, he was murdered by Aegisthus and Clytaemnestra; for she gave him a shirt without sleeves and without a neck, and while he was putting it on he was cut down."[^apd-murder]

His daughter Electra "smuggled away her brother Orestes and gave him to Strophius, the Phocian, to bring up." When grown, Orestes consulted [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) at Delphi and received permission to avenge his father, killing "both his mother and Aegisthus." Pursued by the [Furies](../creatures/erinyes.md), Orestes "was tried in the Areopagus" and "the votes at his trial being equal he was acquitted."[^apd-orestes]
