## Overview

**Agamemnon** is the king of Mycenae and commander-in-chief of the Greek expedition against [Troy](../places/troy.md). His house is cursed through the crimes of his ancestors — [Tantalus](../sources/apollodorus.md), [Pelops](../sources/apollodorus.md), and Atreus — and his own story ends in murder at the hands of his wife and her lover.

## Epithets

Agamemnon's most common Homeric epithet is **"king of men"** (*anax andrōn*), used throughout the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md).[^il1-kingofmen] He is also called **"wide-ruling Agamemnon,"**[^il1-wideruling] **"son of Atreus"** (the standard patronymic),[^il3-atreid] and **"a goodly king and mighty spearman"** — [Helen](helen.md)'s description of him to [Priam](priam.md) from the walls of Troy.[^il3-helen]

[^il1-kingofmen]: "Then Agamemnon king of men made answer to him" (Iliad 1.173, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il1-wideruling]: "son of Atreus, wide-ruling Agamemnon, sore displeased" (Iliad 1.107)
[^il3-atreid]: "This is Atreides, wide-ruling Agamemnon" (Iliad 3.185)
[^il3-helen]: "This is Atreides, wide-ruling Agamemnon, one that is both a goodly king and mighty spearman. And he was my husband's brother to me, ah shameless me; if ever such an one there was" (Iliad 3.185-188)

## Appearance

When [Kalchas](../sources/iliad.md) first told him what he did not want to hear, "his eyes were like flashing fire."[^il1-fire]

The [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) gives Agamemnon the fullest divine comparison of any mortal. As the Greeks assembled for battle, "in their midst lord Agamemnon, his head and eyes like unto Zeus whose joy is in the thunder, and his waist like unto Ares and his breast unto Poseidon. Even as a bull standeth out far foremost amid the herd, for he is pre-eminent amid the pasturing kine, even such did Zeus make Atreides on that day, pre-eminent among many and chief amid heroes."[^il2-appearance]

This is a composite image: Agamemnon has the commanding gaze of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md), the warrior's build of [Ares](../deities/ares.md), and the powerful chest of [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md). The bull simile underscores his physical dominance.

### The Sceptre of the Atreidae

Agamemnon's sceptre has a divine genealogy tracing through five holders: "Agamemnon bearing his sceptre, that Hephaistos had wrought curiously. Hephaistos gave it to king Zeus son of Kronos, and then Zeus gave it to the messenger-god the slayer of Argus; and king Hermes gave it to Pelops the charioteer, and Pelops again gave it to Atreus shepherd of the host. And Atreus dying left it to Thyestes rich in flocks, and Thyestes in his turn left it to Agamemnon to bear, that over many islands and all Argos he should be lord."[^il2-sceptre]

[^il1-fire]: "his dark heart within him was greatly filled with anger, and his eyes were like flashing fire" (Iliad 1.107-109, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il2-sceptre]: "Agamemnon bearing his sceptre, that Hephaistos had wrought curiously. Hephaistos gave it to king Zeus son of Kronos, and then Zeus gave it to the messenger-god the slayer of Argus; and king Hermes gave it to Pelops the charioteer, and Pelops again gave it to Atreus shepherd of the host. And Atreus dying left it to Thyestes rich in flocks, and Thyestes in his turn left it to Agamemnon to bear, that over many islands and all Argos he should be lord" (Iliad 2.106-112)

## Equipment

### The Arming Scene (Book XI)

The [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) gives Agamemnon the most detailed arming scene of any hero. His breastplate was a guest-gift from Kinyras, king of Cyprus, who "heard the mighty rumour how that the Achaians were about to sail forth to Troy in their ships, wherefore did Kinyras give him the breastplate." The corslet was ornately decorated: "therein were ten courses of black cyanus, and twelve of gold, and twenty of tin, and dark blue snakes writhed up towards the neck, three on either side, like rainbows."[^il11-corslet]

His shield was equally grand: "the richly-dight shield of his valour that covereth all the body of a man... round about it were ten circles of bronze, and thereon were twenty white bosses of tin, and one in the midst of black cyanus. And thereon was embossed the Gorgon fell of aspect glaring terribly, and about her were Dread and Terror."[^il11-shield]

He wore "a two-crested helm with fourfold plate, and plume of horse-hair, and terribly the crest nodded from above. And he grasped two strong spears, shod with bronze and keen, and far forth from him into the heaven shone the bronze; and thereat [Hera](../deities/hera.md) and [Athena](../deities/athena.md) thundered, honouring the king of Mykene rich in gold."[^il11-helm]

[^il11-corslet]: "the breastplate that in time past Kinyras gave him for a guest-gift... therein were ten courses of black cyanus, and twelve of gold, and twenty of tin, and dark blue snakes writhed up towards the neck, three on either side, like rainbows that the son of Kronos hath set in the clouds" (Iliad 11.24-31)
[^il11-shield]: "the richly-dight shield of his valour that covereth all the body of a man, a fair shield, and round about it were ten circles of bronze, and thereon were twenty white bosses of tin, and one in the midst of black cyanus. And thereon was embossed the Gorgon fell of aspect glaring terribly, and about her were Dread and Terror" (Iliad 11.34-39)
[^il11-helm]: "on his head Agamemnon set a two-crested helm with fourfold plate, and plume of horse-hair, and terribly the crest nodded from above. And he grasped two strong spears, shod with bronze and keen, and far forth from him into the heaven shone the bronze; and thereat Hera and Athene thundered, honouring the king of Mykene rich in gold" (Iliad 11.42-46)

[^il2-appearance]: "in their midst lord Agamemnon, his head and eyes like unto Zeus whose joy is in the thunder, and his waist like unto Ares and his breast unto Poseidon. Even as a bull standeth out far foremost amid the herd, for he is pre-eminent amid the pasturing kine, even such did Zeus make Atreides on that day, pre-eminent among many and chief amid heroes" (Iliad 2.462-467, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

## In the Bibliotheca

### Parentage and Rise to Power (3.2.1-2, E.2.10-16)

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) gives Agamemnon's descent through the House of Atreus. Catreus, son of [Minos](minos.md), "gave Aerope and Clymene to Nauplius to sell into foreign lands; and of these two Aerope became the wife of Plisthenes, who begat Agamemnon and Menelaus."[^apd-parentage]

Atreus and his brother Thyestes struggled for the throne of Mycenae. When Thyestes seduced Aerope and gained the golden lamb, [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) "sent [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md) to Atreus and told him to stipulate with Thyestes that Atreus should be king if the sun should go backward; and when Thyestes agreed, the sun set in the east."[^apd-sun] Atreus then took terrible revenge, slaughtering Thyestes' sons and serving them to their father at a feast.[^apd-feast]

After Atreus was killed by Aegisthus (Thyestes' son by his own daughter), "the nurse took Agamemnon and Menelaus to Polyphides, lord of Sicyon." Eventually Tyndareus restored them, "and they drove away Thyestes to dwell in Cytheria."[^apd-restored] Agamemnon married Clytaemnestra "after he had slain her spouse Tantalus, the son of Thyestes, together with his newborn babe."[^apd-marriage]

### The Trojan War (E.3.1-E.5.23)

When [Alexander](../sources/apollodorus.md) (Paris) carried off [Helen](helen.md), "Menelaus came to Agamemnon at Mycenae, and begged him to muster an army against Troy and to raise levies in Greece." Agamemnon "in person was in command of the whole army" and brought a hundred ships from Mycenae.[^apd-command]

At Aulis, [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md) demanded the sacrifice of his daughter Iphigenia, "for the goddess was angry with Agamemnon, both because, on shooting a deer, he had said, 'Artemis herself could not (do it better),' and because Atreus had not sacrificed to her the golden lamb." Agamemnon sent for Iphigenia on the pretext of marrying her to [Achilles](achilles.md), "and was about to slaughter her, when Artemis carried her off to the Taurians and appointed her to be her priestess, substituting a deer for her at the altar."[^apd-iphigenia]

### Murder and Aftermath (E.6.23-28)

"After Agamemnon had returned to Mycenae with Cassandra, he was murdered by Aegisthus and Clytaemnestra; for she gave him a shirt without sleeves and without a neck, and while he was putting it on he was cut down."[^apd-murder]

His daughter Electra "smuggled away her brother Orestes and gave him to Strophius, the Phocian, to bring up." When grown, Orestes consulted [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) at Delphi and received permission to avenge his father, killing "both his mother and Aegisthus." Pursued by the [Furies](../creatures/erinyes.md), Orestes "was tried in the Areopagus" and "the votes at his trial being equal he was acquitted."[^apd-orestes]

## In the Fabulae

### Iphigenia at Aulis (§98)

The Fabulae provides a detailed account of the sacrifice at Aulis. The reason for [Diana](../deities/artemis.md)'s anger: "a storm kept them at Aulis because of the anger of Diana. Agamemnon had wounded a deer of hers in hunting, and had spoken rather haughtily against Diana."[^hyg98-anger]

When Calchas declared that only the sacrifice of Iphigenia could expiate the offense, "Agamemnon at first refused. Then [Ulysses](odysseus.md) by his advice won him over to a fine scheme."[^hyg98-ulysses] The deception was elaborate: "The same Ulysses along with Diomede was sent to get Iphigenia, and when he came to Clytemnestra her mother, he falsely said she was to be given in marriage to [Achilles](achilles.md)."[^hyg98-deception]

The substitution: "When she was brought to Aulis, and her father was about to sacrifice her, Diana pitied the girl, cast mist about her, and substituted a deer in her place. She bore Iphigenia through the clouds to the Tauric land, and there made her a priestess of her temple."[^hyg98-substitution]

[^hyg98-anger]: "When Agamemnon with his brother Menelaus and chosen leaders of Asia were going to Troy to recover Helen, wife of Menelaus, whom Alexander Paris had carried off, a storm kept them at Aulis because of the anger of Diana. Agamemnon had wounded a deer of hers in hunting, and had spoken rather haughtily against Diana" (Fabulae §98, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg98-ulysses]: "When he had called together the soothsayers, and Calchas had declared that he could expiate in no other way than by sacrificing his daughter, Iphigenia, Agamemnon at first refused. Then Ulysses by his advice won him over to a fine scheme" (Fabulae §98, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg98-deception]: "The same Ulysses along with Diomede was sent to get Iphigenia, and when he came to Clytemnestra her mother, he falsely said she was to be given in marriage to Achilles" (Fabulae §98, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg98-substitution]: "When she was brought to Aulis, and her father was about to sacrifice her, Diana pitied the girl, cast mist about her, and substituted a deer in her place. She bore Iphigenia through the clouds to the Tauric land, and there made her a priestess of her temple" (Fabulae §98, trans. Mary Grant)

### Clytemnestra's Murder (§117)

Hyginus attributes a different motivation to Clytemnestra's crime. "Clytemnestra, daughter of Tyndareus and wife of Agamemnon, heard from Oiax, brother of Palamedes, that Cassandra was being brought as a concubine to her house, a false statement Oiax made in order to avenge the wrong done to his brother."[^hyg117-oiax]

The murder weapon differs from Apollodorus: "Then Clytemnestra, together with Aegisthus, son of Thyestes, planned to kill Agamemnon and Cassandra. They killed him with an axe as he was sacrificing, and Cassandra, too."[^hyg117-axe]

Electra's rescue of [Orestes](orestes.md) follows: "But Electra, Agamemnon's daughter, rescued her brother, the infant Orestes, and sent him to Strophius in Phocis. Strophius had married Agamemnon's sister, Astyoche."[^hyg117-rescue]

[^hyg117-oiax]: "Clytemnestra, daughter of Tyndareus and wife of Agamemnon, heard from Oiax, brother of Palamedes, that Cassandra was being brought as a concubine to her house, a false statement Oiax made in order to avenge the wrong done to his brother" (Fabulae §117, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg117-axe]: "Then Clytemnestra, together with Aegisthus, son of Thyestes, planned to kill Agamemnon and Cassandra. They killed him with an axe as he was sacrificing, and Cassandra, too" (Fabulae §117, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg117-rescue]: "But Electra, Agamemnon's daughter, rescued her brother, the infant Orestes, and sent him to Strophius in Phocis. Strophius had married Agamemnon's sister, Astyoche" (Fabulae §117, trans. Mary Grant)

## In [Pindar](../sources/pindar.md)

### Murder at Amyklai (Pythian XI)

Pindar's Pythian XI locates the murder at Amyklai — a variant from other accounts that place it at Mycenae. "The hero himself, the son of Atreus, when after long time he came unto famous Amyklai, and drew down with him to death the maiden prophetess" — that is, Kassandra, killed alongside him.[^pin-amyklai] The son of Atreus is described as having consumed with fire the habitations of Troy, then met his death on this homecoming.

[^pin-amyklai]: "Thus died the hero himself, the son of Atreus, when after long time he came unto famous Amyklai, and drew down with him to death the maiden prophetess, after that he consumed with fire the Trojans' habitations of softness" (Pindar, Pythian XI, trans. Ernest Myers)
