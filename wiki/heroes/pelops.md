## Overview

**Pelops** was the son of Tantalus, beloved of [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md), and the legendary founder of the Olympic chariot race. He won Hippodameia by defeating her father Oinomaos with a golden chariot and winged steeds given by Poseidon. The Peloponnese ("Pelops' island") bears his name. He received hero-cult at Olympia, where "many strangers resort" to his tomb beside the Alpheos.[^pin-tomb]

[^pin-tomb]: "hath he part in honour of blood-offerings in his grave beside Alpheos' stream, and hath a frequented tomb, whereto many strangers resort" (Pindar, Olympian I, trans. Ernest Myers)

## In [Pindar](../sources/pindar.md)

### The Variant of the Feast (Olympian I)

Pindar famously rejects the traditional story that Tantalus butchered Pelops and served him to the gods. He declares: "to me it is impossible to call one of the blessed gods cannibal; I keep aloof; in telling ill tales is often little gain."[^pin-reject]

Instead, Pindar tells a different story: at Tantalus's feast on Sipylus, [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) fell in love with Pelops and snatched him away, "his heart vanquished by love," carrying him behind golden steeds to the house of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) in the highest heaven — "whither again on a like errand came Ganymede in the after time."[^pin-snatch] When Pelops vanished, "some one of the envious neighbours said secretly that over water heated to boiling they had hewn asunder with a knife thy limbs, and at the tables had shared among them and eaten sodden fragments of thy flesh" — but this, Pindar insists, was malicious rumour.[^pin-rumour]

The ivory shoulder — which other traditions attribute to the gods replacing the shoulder eaten by [Demeter](../deities/demeter.md) — Pindar attributes to his birth: "from the vessel of purifying Klotho took him with the bright ivory furnishment of his shoulder."[^pin-ivory]

### Tantalus's Punishment

[Tantalus](../heroes/tantalus.md) was honoured above all mortals by the gods, but "his high fortune he could not digest, and by excess thereof won him an overwhelming woe, in that the Father hath hung above him a mighty stone that he would fain ward from his head, and therewithal he is fallen from joy."[^pin-tantalus] His crime was stealing nectar and ambrosia from the gods and sharing them with mortal men.[^pin-theft]

### The Chariot Race (Olympian I)

The gods sent Pelops back to earth to live among mortals. When he reached manhood, he desired Hippodameia, daughter of Oinomaos of Pisa, who had already slain thirteen suitors in chariot races. Pelops went alone to the sea at night and called on Poseidon, who appeared at his feet.

Pelops prayed: "if the kind gifts of the Cyprian goddess are anywise pleasant in thine eyes, restrain Oinomaos' bronze spear, and send me unto Elis upon a chariot exceeding swift, and give the victory to my hands."[^pin-prayer] He declared: "a great peril alloweth not of a coward: and forasmuch as men must die, wherefore should one sit vainly in the dark through a dull and nameless age, and without lot in noble deeds?"[^pin-courage]

Poseidon answered: "the god made him a glorious gift of a golden car and winged untiring steeds: so he overcame Oinomaos and won the maiden for his bride."[^pin-gift]

### Legacy

Pelops "begat six sons, chieftains, whose thoughts were ever of brave deeds."[^pin-sons] He was honoured with blood-offerings at his tomb beside the Alpheos, and "from afar off he beholdeth the glory of the Olympian games in the courses called of Pelops."[^pin-tomb]

### Islands of the Blessed (Olympian II)

In Olympian II, Peleus and [Kadmos](../heroes/cadmus.md) are named as inhabitants of the Islands of the Blessed, along with [Achilles](../heroes/achilles.md), "whom his mother bare thither when her prayer had moved the heart of Zeus."[^pin-blessed] There "round the islands of the blest the Ocean-breezes blow, and golden flowers are glowing," and Rhadamanthys holds court beside [Kronos](../deities/cronos.md).[^pin-islands]

[^pin-reject]: "to me it is impossible to call one of the blessed gods cannibal; I keep aloof; in telling ill tales is often little gain" (Pindar, Olympian I)
[^pin-snatch]: "he of the Bright Trident, his heart vanquished by love, snatch thee and bear thee behind his golden steeds to the house of august Zeus in the highest, whither again on a like errand came Ganymede in the after time" (Pindar, Olympian I)
[^pin-rumour]: "some one of the envious neighbours said secretly that over water heated to boiling they had hewn asunder with a knife thy limbs, and at the tables had shared among them and eaten sodden fragments of thy flesh" (Pindar, Olympian I)
[^pin-ivory]: "from the vessel of purifying Klotho took him with the bright ivory furnishment of his shoulder" (Pindar, Olympian I)
[^pin-tantalus]: "his high fortune he could not digest, and by excess thereof won him an overwhelming woe, in that the Father hath hung above him a mighty stone that he would fain ward from his head, and therewithal he is fallen from joy" (Pindar, Olympian I)
[^pin-theft]: "he stole from the immortals and gave to his fellows at a feast the nectar and ambrosia, whereby the gods had made him incorruptible" (Pindar, Olympian I)
[^pin-prayer]: "if the kind gifts of the Cyprian goddess are anywise pleasant in thine eyes, restrain Oinomaos' bronze spear, and send me unto Elis upon a chariot exceeding swift, and give the victory to my hands" (Pindar, Olympian I)
[^pin-courage]: "a great peril alloweth not of a coward: and forasmuch as men must die, wherefore should one sit vainly in the dark through a dull and nameless age, and without lot in noble deeds?" (Pindar, Olympian I)
[^pin-gift]: "the god made him a glorious gift of a golden car and winged untiring steeds: so he overcame Oinomaos and won the maiden for his bride" (Pindar, Olympian I)
[^pin-sons]: "he begat six sons, chieftains, whose thoughts were ever of brave deeds" (Pindar, Olympian I)
[^pin-blessed]: "Peleus and Kadmos are counted of that company; and the mother of Achilles, when her prayer had moved the heart of Zeus, bare thither her son" (Pindar, Olympian II)
[^pin-islands]: "round the islands of the blest the Ocean-breezes blow, and golden flowers are glowing, some from the land on trees of splendour, and some the water feedeth" (Pindar, Olympian II)

### Cleansing by Hephaestus (E.2.9)

After committing an unspecified offence, Pelops was purified by [Hephaestus](../deities/hephaestus.md): "when Pelops had reached the Ocean and been cleansed by Hephaestus."[^apd-cleansed]

[^apd-cleansed]: "when Pelops had reached the Ocean and been cleansed by Hephaestus" (Bibliotheca E.2.9, trans. Frazer)

## Variant Traditions

Pindar's version of the Tantalus feast is explicitly polemical. He rejects the widespread tradition (found in other sources) that Tantalus served Pelops's flesh to the gods to test their omniscience, and that the gods restored him to life but [Demeter](../deities/demeter.md), distracted by grief, had eaten his shoulder, which was replaced with ivory. In Pindar's telling, the ivory shoulder was present from birth, Poseidon took Pelops to heaven out of love (paralleling the Ganymede story), and the cannibal feast was slander by envious neighbours.
