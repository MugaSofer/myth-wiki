## Overview

**Jocasta** was queen of [Thebes](../places/thebes.md), wife of [Laius](../heroes/laius.md) and later, unknowingly, of her own son [Oedipus](../heroes/oedipus.md). When the truth of the incestuous marriage was revealed, she hanged herself. Homer refers to her as Epicasta.

## In the Odyssey

In the Nekuia, Odysseus sees "the mother of Oedipodes, fair Epicaste, who wrought a dread deed unwittingly, being wedded to her son; and he that had slain his own father wedded her." When the truth was revealed, "she went down to the house of Hades... and left behind full many woes, even all that the Avengers of a mother bring to pass."[^od-epicaste]

## In the Bibliotheca

The oracle warned Laius not to beget a son. When the child was born, Laius pierced its ankles and exposed it. Oedipus later returned and "unwittingly married his mother, and begat sons by her, Polynices and Eteocles, and daughters, Ismene and Antigone." When the truth came to light, "Jocasta hanged herself in a noose."[^apd-jocasta]

## In the Fabulae

Hyginus names her throughout. After the recognition, "Jocasta, his mother and wife, hanged herself."[^hyg-jocasta]

## In Sophocles' Oedipus the King

Jocasta plays a central role. She first appears as peacemaker between Oedipus and [Creon](../heroes/creon.md): "Misguided princes, why have ye upraised / This wordy wrangle? Are ye not ashamed, / While the whole land lies stricken" (~634-636).[^sot-peacemaker]

Attempting to discredit prophecy and calm Oedipus, she inadvertently reveals the crucial detail — that Laius was killed "at a spot where three roads meet" (~716).[^sot-crossroads] She recounts the oracle to Laius: "An oracle / Once came to Laius... / His doom it was to perish by the hand / Of his own child" (~711-714).[^sot-oracle] She insists the oracle failed because "robbers" killed Laius and the child was exposed.

When the Corinthian messenger reveals Oedipus was adopted, Jocasta is the first to understand the full truth. She begs Oedipus to stop his investigation: "God help thee! — if thou dost value thine own life, / Forbear this search!" (~1060-1061).[^sot-forbear] When he refuses, she flees.

A second messenger reports her death: "she hurried straight to win / The bridal-chamber, clutching at her hair / With both her hands, and, once within the room, / She shut the doors behind her with a crash. / 'Laius,' she cried, and called her husband dead / Long, long ago." She was found "hanging there, / A running noose entwined about her neck."[^sot-death]

## In Euripides' Phoenissae

Jocasta serves as narrator of the prologue, recounting the full genealogy of the house of Thebes and her own history. She lives long enough to attempt mediation between her warring sons [Eteocles](../heroes/eteocles.md) and [Polyneices](../heroes/polyneices.md). When both sons die in mutual combat, she kills herself over their bodies on the battlefield.[^phoen-death]

## Variant Traditions

The identity of Oedipus's children's mother is disputed. While most sources name Jocasta, the [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) notes "some say the children were borne by Eurygania, daughter of Hyperphas" (3.5.8). The [Epic Cycle](../sources/epic-cycle.md)'s "Story of Oedipus" similarly names Euryganeia rather than Jocasta as the mother of the four children.
