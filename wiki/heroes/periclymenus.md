# Periclymenus

Two distinct figures bear the name Periclymenus in the sources: a shape-shifting son of [Neleus](../heroes/neleus.md) at Pylos, and a son of [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) who defended [Thebes](../places/thebes.md). Both are connected to Poseidon and both are warriors, but they belong to different generations and different myths.

## Periclymenus of Pylos

| | |
|---|---|
| **Parents** | [Neleus](../heroes/neleus.md) and Chloris |
| **Homeland** | Pylos |
| **Known for** | Shape-shifting; slain by [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) |
| **Divine patron** | [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) (grandfather) |
| **First appearance** | Hesiod, [Catalogue of Women](../sources/hesiod.md) (Fragment 10) |

### Overview

**Periclymenus** was the eldest and most valiant son of [Neleus](../heroes/neleus.md), king of Pylos, and Chloris. He was granted the power of shape-shifting by his grandfather [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md), and used it in battle against [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) when the hero attacked Pylos. Despite his transformations, he was killed — the most prominent example in the sources of a shape-shifter whose power ultimately fails him.

### Powers

Periclymenus's shape-shifting ability is described in remarkable detail across the sources, more so than any other shape-shifter except [Proteus](../deities/proteus.md).

The [Catalogue of Women](../sources/hesiod.md) gives the fullest account of his gift: "earth-shaking Poseidon gave him all manner of gifts. At one time he would appear among birds, an eagle; and again at another he would be an ant, a marvel to see; and then a shining swarm of bees; and again at another time a dread relentless snake. And he possessed all manner of gifts which cannot be told."[^hes-gifts]

[Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) states simply that "Poseidon granted the power of changing his shape."[^apd-power] The [Argonautica](../sources/argonautica.md) specifies that Poseidon "had given him boundless strength and granted him that whatever shape he should crave during the fight, that he should take in the stress of battle."[^arg-power]

[Ovid](../sources/metamorphoses.md), narrating through [Nestor](../heroes/nestor.md), says "Neptune, the founder of my family, had granted him a power to assume whatever shape he chose, and when he wished to lay that shape aside."[^met-power]

### In the Catalogue of Women

Hesiod's account describes Periclymenus's final battle. "He changed himself in one of his wonted shapes and perched on the yoke-boss of Heracles' horses, meaning to fight with the hero; but Heracles, secretly instructed by Athena, wounded him mortally with an arrow."[^hes-death] The poet notes that his gifts "ensnared him through the devising of Athene" — it was [Athena](../deities/athena.md), not Heracles alone, who overcame the shape-shifter.[^hes-athena]

### In the Bibliotheca

[Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) describes Periclymenus's death during Heracles' sack of Pylos. In the genealogical passage: "when Hercules was ravaging Pylus, in the fight Periclymenus turned himself into a lion, a snake, and a bee, but was slain by Hercules with the other sons of Neleus."[^apd-forms] [Nestor](../heroes/nestor.md) alone survived, "because he was brought up among the Gerenians."[^apd-nestor]

Later, in the account of Heracles' campaigns: "having taken the city he slew Periclymenus, the most valiant of the sons of Neleus, who used to change his shape in battle. And he slew Neleus and his sons, except Nestor."[^apd-campaign] In this same fight, Heracles "also wounded [Hades](../deities/hades.md), who was siding with the Pylians."[^apd-hades]

### In the Metamorphoses

[Ovid](../sources/metamorphoses.md) gives the most dramatic account, narrated by Nestor himself as an explanation for why he refuses to praise Heracles. Periclymenus, "in vain, had been transformed to many other shapes," then "turned into the form of that bird, which is wont to carry in his crooked talons the forked lightnings, favorite bird of Jove" — an eagle.[^met-eagle]

As an eagle, "with wings and crooked bill and sharp-hooked talons, he assailed and tore the face of Hercules." But when he soared away, "that hero aimed his too unerring bow and hit him where the new wing joined his side. The wound was not large, but his sinews cut failed to uphold him, and denied his wings their strength and motion."[^met-shot] He fell, and "the sharp arrow, which had lightly pierced the wing, was driven upward through the side into the left part of my brother's neck."[^met-death]

Nestor concludes bitterly: "why should I sing the praise of Hercules? But for my brothers I take no revenge except withholding praise of his great deeds."[^met-nestor-grudge]

### In the Fabulae

[Hyginus](../sources/hyginus.md) gives a briefer account: Heracles "slew Neleus and ten of his sons, but the eleventh, Periclymenus, was changed to an eagle by the favour of Neptune, his grandfather, and escaped death."[^hyg-escape] This is notably different from all other sources — in Hyginus, Periclymenus *survives* by taking eagle form, rather than being shot down in it.

### As Argonaut

Multiple sources list Periclymenus among the [Argonauts](../events/argonautica-voyage.md). Apollodorus includes "Periclymenus, son of Neleus" in the crew list.[^apd-argonaut] [Apollonius](../sources/argonautica.md) calls him "Neleian Periclymenus... eldest of all the sons of godlike Neleus who were born at Pylos."[^arg-argonaut] Hyginus lists him as "Periclymenus, son of Neleus and Chloris, daughter of Amphion and Niobe; he was from Pylos."[^hyg-argonaut]

### In the Odyssey

[Homer](../sources/odyssey.md) mentions Periclymenus only in passing, as one of the children Chloris bore to Neleus: "she was queen of Pylos, and bare glorious children to her lord, Nestor and Chromius, and princely Periclymenus."[^od-periclymenus] No mention is made of his shape-shifting or manner of death.

### Variant Traditions

The sources disagree on whether Periclymenus died or survived. In Hesiod, Apollodorus, and Ovid, he is killed by Heracles — shot with an arrow while in animal form (perched on a yoke-boss in Hesiod, as an eagle in Ovid, in unspecified form in Apollodorus). In Hyginus, he escapes as an eagle. Hesiod credits [Athena](../deities/athena.md) with secretly guiding Heracles; Ovid attributes it to Heracles' own marksmanship.

The specific forms he takes also vary: Hesiod lists eagle, ant, swarm of bees, and snake; Apollodorus gives lion, snake, and bee; Ovid mentions many unspecified shapes before the final eagle form.

Hyginus §157 lists "Periclymenus and Ancaeus by Astypale, daughter of Phoenix" among the sons of [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) — a different mother from the Chloris given elsewhere. This may reflect a variant tradition or confusion with the Theban Periclymenus below.[^hyg-parentage]

## Periclymenus of Thebes

| | |
|---|---|
| **Parents** | [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) |
| **Homeland** | [Thebes](../places/thebes.md) |
| **Known for** | Defending Thebes against the Seven; killed Parthenopaeus |

### Overview

A second **Periclymenus**, son of [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md), was a defender of Thebes during the war of the [Seven against Thebes](../events/seven-against-thebes.md).

### In Euripides

In the [Phoenissae](../sources/euripides-phoenissae.md), Periclymenus kills Parthenopaeus during the assault on Thebes: "Periclymenus the son of the God of the Ocean stopped him in his raging, hurling at his head a stone, a wagon-load, a pinnacle rent from the battlement; and dashed in pieces his head with its auburn hair, and crushed the suture of the bones."[^eur-parthenopaeus]

### In the Bibliotheca

[Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) notes the attribution: "Euripides says that Parthenopaeus was slain by Periclymenus, son of Poseidon."[^apd-thebes] In the same passage, Periclymenus pursued [Amphiaraus](../heroes/amphiaraus.md) as the seer fled, and "before Periclymenus could wound him in the back, Zeus cleft the earth by throwing a thunderbolt, and Amphiaraus vanished with his chariot."[^apd-amphiaraus]

### In the Thebais

A lost epic, the *Thebais*, also credited Periclymenus with killing Parthenopaeus, as reported by Pausanias: "that part of the Thebais which tells of the death of Parthenopaeus says that it was Periclymenus who killed him."[^hes-thebais]
