# Cygnus

Multiple figures in Greek mythology bear the name **Cygnus** (or Cycnus, "swan"). The most prominent are a son of [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) who fought at [Troy](../places/troy.md), a son of [Ares](../deities/ares.md) slain by [Heracles](heracles.md), and a relative of [Phaethon](phaethon.md) transformed into a swan.

## Cygnus, Son of Poseidon

| | |
|---|---|
| **Parents** | [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) and Proclia |
| **Children** | Tenes, Hemithea |
| **Known for** | [Invulnerability](../concepts/invulnerability.md), death at the hands of [Achilles](achilles.md) |

### In the Metamorphoses

Ovid gives the fullest account of this Cygnus. At the Greek landing at [Troy](../places/troy.md), "Cygnus, Neptune's son there slew a thousand men," prompting [Achilles](achilles.md) to drive his chariot straight at him.[^met-cygnus-intro]

Cygnus proved completely [invulnerable](../concepts/invulnerability.md). Achilles' spear struck true but "only bruised, as with a blunted stroke, the breast of Cygnus." Cygnus taunted Achilles: "This helmet crowned, great with its tawny horse-hair, and this shield, broad-hollowed, on my left arm, are not held for help in war: they are but ornament, as Mars wears armor. All of them shall be put off, and I will fight with you unhurt. It is a privilege that I was born not as you, of a Nereid but of him whose powerful rule is over Nereus, his daughters and their ocean."[^met-cygnus-taunt]

No weapon could harm him. Achilles hurled spear after spear, "Nor did a third spear injure Cygnus, though he stood there with his body all exposed."[^met-three-spears] Even Achilles' sword "was even blunted on the flesh."[^met-sword] Finally, Achilles resorted to brute force: he battered Cygnus with sword-hilt and shield, knocked him to the ground, "and pressing with buckler and hard knees the breast of Cygnus, he unlaced the helmet thongs, wound them about the foeman's neck and drew them tightly under his chin, till Cygnus' throat could take no breath of life."[^met-strangling]

When Achilles rose to strip the body, he found only empty armour — Poseidon had transformed his son into a white swan, "the god of ocean had changed the victim into that white bird whose name he lately bore."[^met-transformation]

### In the Bibliotheca

[Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) gives a briefer account. He records that Cygnus was the father of Tenes, ruler of Tenedos, by Proclia, daughter of Laomedon. Cygnus's second wife falsely accused Tenes of seduction, and "Cycnus believed her, and putting him and his sister in a chest he set them adrift on the sea." He later learned the truth, "stoned the flute-player to death and buried his wife alive."[^apd-tenes]

At the landing at Troy, Apollodorus describes only that "Achilles landed with the Myrmidons, and throwing a stone at the head of Cycnus, killed him."[^apd-cygnus-death] There is no mention of invulnerability.

### In the Epic Cycle

The summary of the *Cypria* notes that "Achilles then kills Cycnus, the son of Poseidon, and drives the Trojans back."[^epic-cygnus]

## Cycnus, Son of Ares

| | |
|---|---|
| **Parents** | [Ares](../deities/ares.md) |
| **Known for** | Waylaying pilgrims; slain by [Heracles](heracles.md) |

There appear to be two sons of Ares named Cycnus, both killed by Heracles.

### In the Shield of Heracles

This Cycnus waylaid pilgrims near [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md)'s temple at Pagasae. [Heracles](heracles.md) encountered "Cycnus, the gallant son of Ares" in the temple precinct, where "blameless Cycnus was glad, for he looked to slay the warlike son of Zeus and his charioteer with the sword, and to strip off their splendid armour."[^sh-cycnus-intro] Heracles killed him with a spear-thrust to the neck, then fought and wounded Ares himself. Cycnus was buried by King Ceyx, but Apollo "commanded him, because he used to watch for and despoil the rich offerings that men brought to Apollo's temple" — and sent the river Anaurus to destroy the grave.[^sh-cycnus-grave]

### In the Bibliotheca

Apollodorus mentions two encounters. During the quest for the golden apples, "Cycnus, son of Ares and Pyrene, challenged him to single combat. Ares championed the cause of Cycnus and marshalled the combat, but a thunderbolt was hurled between the two and parted the combatants."[^apd-cycnus1] Later, at Itonus, Heracles "was challenged to single combat by Cycnus a son of Ares and Pelopia; and closing with him Hercules slew him also."[^apd-cycnus2] The two different mothers suggest Apollodorus understood these as distinct individuals.

### In the Fabulae

[Hyginus](../sources/hyginus.md) lists Cycnus among the sons of Mars, and separately names "Another Cygnus, son of Mars, whom the same Hercules killed" among the most famous mortals.[^hyg-cycnus]

## Cycnus, Kinsman of Phaethon

### In the Metamorphoses

A third Cycnus — son of Sthenelus and kinsman of [Phaethon](phaethon.md) — was transformed into a swan out of grief for Phaethon's death. He "left his kingdom of Liguria, and all its peopled cities, to lament" beside the river Eridanus where Phaethon fell. As he mourned, "his manly voice began to pipe a treble, shrill; and long gray plumes concealed his hair. A slender neck extended from his breast, and reddening toes were joined together by a membrane. Wings grew from his sides, and from his mouth was made a blunted beak."[^met-phaethon-cygnus] Having become a swan, "he fears to trust the skies and Jove, for he remembers fires, unjustly sent."[^met-swan-fears]

### In the Aeneid

[Virgil](../sources/aeneid.md) alludes to this Cycnus briefly, noting "Cycnus, in grief for his beloved Phaëthon" was transformed.[^aen-cycnus]
