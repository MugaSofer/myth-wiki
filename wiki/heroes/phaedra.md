## Overview

**Phaedra** was a daughter of [Minos](minos.md) and Pasiphae, sister of [Ariadne](ariadne.md), and wife of [Theseus](theseus.md). [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md) struck her with an uncontrollable passion for her stepson [Hippolytus](hippolytus.md) as revenge for his rejection of the goddess. When Hippolytus refused her, Phaedra killed herself, leaving a false accusation that led Theseus to destroy his own son. She placed herself in a line of women cursed in love — her mother Pasiphae (the bull), her sister Ariadne ([Dionysus](../deities/dionysus.md)), and herself.

## In Euripides' Hippolytus

[Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md) announces in the prologue that she has struck Phaedra with love for [Hippolytus](hippolytus.md), acknowledging that Phaedra will die as collateral damage: "I will not make her ills of that high consequence, that will hinder my enemies from giving me such full vengeance as may content me."[^eur-prologue]

Phaedra wastes away in silence, refusing food. When her Nurse finally extracts the confession, Phaedra places her suffering in her family's cursed line: "O wretched mother, what a love didst thou love!" (Pasiphae and the bull), "Thou, too, O wretched sister, wife of Bacchus!" ([Ariadne](ariadne.md)), "And I the third, how unhappily I perish!"[^eur-line]

Phaedra insists she has fought the passion. She describes a three-stage struggle: first she tried to endure and conquer it by silence; then to overcome it by self-discipline; and when both failed, resolved to die rather than act on it. She is explicit about her concern for honour: she will not shame her husband or her children.[^eur-struggle]

The Nurse, however, reveals the secret to Hippolytus, who delivers a tirade against women. Hearing this through the door, Phaedra resolves on a final act: she will die, but leave a tablet accusing Hippolytus of assault — destroying him to protect her own reputation and, as she sees it, punish his rejection.[^eur-tablet]

## In the Bibliotheca

[Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) gives a compressed account. [Theseus](theseus.md) "received from Deucalion in marriage Phaedra, daughter of Minos." She "fell in love with the son he had by the Amazon, to wit, Hippolytus, and besought him to lie with her. Howbeit, he fled from her embraces, because he hated all women."[^apd-love]

"But Phaedra, fearing that he might accuse her to his father, cleft open the doors of her bed-chamber, rent her garments, and falsely charged Hippolytus with an assault." After [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md)'s bull killed Hippolytus, "when her passion was made public, Phaedra hanged herself."[^apd-death]

[^apd-love]: "Phaedra, after she had borne two children, Acamas and Demophon, to Theseus, fell in love with the son he had by the Amazon, to wit, Hippolytus, and besought him to lie with her. Howbeit, he fled from her embraces, because he hated all women" (Bibliotheca E.1.18, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-death]: "Phaedra, fearing that he might accuse her to his father, cleft open the doors of her bed-chamber, rent her garments, and falsely charged Hippolytus with an assault... when her passion was made public, Phaedra hanged herself" (Bibliotheca E.1.18-19, trans. J.G. Frazer)
