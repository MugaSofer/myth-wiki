## Overview

**Daedalus** is a master craftsman — "an excellent architect and the first inventor of images" — who built the Labyrinth for [Minos](minos.md) to contain the Minotaur, constructed wings for himself and his son **Icarus** to escape Crete, and fled to Sicily where Minos pursued him to his death.

## In the Bibliotheca

### Exile from Athens (3.15.8)

Daedalus "had fled from Athens, because he had thrown down from the acropolis Talos, the son of his sister Perdix; for Talos was his pupil, and Daedalus feared that with his talents he might surpass himself, seeing that he had sawed a thin stick with a jawbone of a snake which he had found." The body was discovered, "Daedalus was tried in the Areopagus, and being condemned fled to Minos."[^apd-exile]

### The Wooden Cow and the Labyrinth (3.1.4, 3.15.8)

In Crete, Pasiphae "found an accomplice in Daedalus, an architect, who had been banished from Athens for murder. He constructed a wooden cow on wheels, took it, hollowed it out in the inside, sewed it up in the hide of a cow which he had skinned, and set it in the meadow in which the bull used to graze."[^apd-cow]

Pasiphae "gave birth to Asterius, who was called the Minotaur. He had the face of a bull, but the rest of him was human; and [Minos](minos.md), in compliance with certain oracles, shut him up and guarded him in the Labyrinth." The Labyrinth "was a chamber 'that with its tangled windings perplexed the outward way.'"[^apd-labyrinth]

### Ariadne's Clue (E.1.8-9)

When [Theseus](theseus.md) came to slay the Minotaur, [Ariadne](ariadne.md) "besought Daedalus to disclose the way out of the labyrinth. And at his suggestion she gave Theseus a clue when he went in; Theseus fastened it to the door, and, drawing it after him, entered in."[^apd-clue]

### The Flight (E.1.12-13)

After Theseus escaped, "Minos shut up the guilty Daedalus in the labyrinth, along with his son Icarus, who had been borne to Daedalus by Naucrate, a female slave of Minos."[^apd-imprisoned]

"Daedalus constructed wings for himself and his son, and enjoined his son, when he took to flight, neither to fly high, lest the glue should melt in the sun and the wings should drop off, nor to fly near the sea, lest the pinions should be detached by the damp."[^apd-wings]

"But the infatuated Icarus, disregarding his father's injunctions, soared ever higher, till, the glue melting, he fell into the sea called after him Icarian, and perished. But Daedalus made his way safely to Camicus in Sicily."[^apd-fall]

### The Spiral Shell and Minos's Death (E.1.14-15)

"Minos pursued Daedalus, and in every country that he searched he carried a spiral shell and promised to give a great reward to him who should pass a thread through the shell, believing that by that means he should discover Daedalus." When [Minos](minos.md) came to Camicus, Cocalus gave the shell to Daedalus, who "fastened a thread to an ant, and, having bored a hole in the spiral shell, allowed the ant to pass through it."[^apd-shell]

When Minos discovered Daedalus and demanded his surrender, "Cocalus promised to surrender him, and made an entertainment for Minos; but after his bath Minos was undone by the daughters of Cocalus; some say, however, that he died through being drenched with boiling water."[^apd-death]

## In the Fabulae

### Murder of Perdix (§39)

The [Fabulae](../sources/hyginus.md) recounts the crime that drove Daedalus to Crete: "Daedalus, son of Eupalamus, who is said to have received the art of craftsmanship from Athena, threw down from the roof Perdix, son of his sister, envying his skill, because he first invented the saw."[^hyg-perdix] It was this murder that forced his exile: "Because of this crime he went into exile from Athens to Crete to King [Minos](minos.md)."[^hyg-exile]

[^hyg-perdix]: "Daedalus, son of Eupalamus, who is said to have received the art of craftsmanship from Athena, threw down from the roof Perdix, son of his sister, envying his skill, because he first invented the saw" (Fabulae §39, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-exile]: "Because of this crime he went into exile from Athens to Crete to King Minos" (Fabulae §39, trans. Mary Grant)

### Pasiphae's Wooden Cow and the Labyrinth (§40)

At Crete, Daedalus became entangled in the queen's unnatural passion. "Pasiphae, daughter of Sol and wife of [Minos](minos.md), for several years did not make offerings to the goddess Venus. Because of this Venus inspired in her an unnatural love for a bull."[^hyg-pasiphae] When Daedalus arrived as an exile, Pasiphae asked him for help: "For her he made a wooden heifer, and put in it the hide of a real heifer, and in this she lay with the bull. From this intercourse she bore the Minotaur, with bull's head but human body."[^hyg-cow]

Daedalus then "made for the Minotaur a labyrinth with an undiscoverable exit in which it was confined."[^hyg-labyrinth] When [Minos](minos.md) discovered the affair, "he cast Daedalus into prison, but Pasiphae freed him from his chains."[^hyg-prison]

[^hyg-pasiphae]: "Pasiphae, daughter of Sol and wife of Minos, for several years did not make offerings to the goddess Venus. Because of this Venus inspired in her an unnatural love for a bull" (Fabulae §40, trans. Mary Grant)

[^hyg-labyrinth]: "Then Daedalus made for the Minotaur a labyrinth with an undiscoverable exit in which it was confined" (Fabulae §40, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-prison]: "When Minos found out the affair he cast Daedalus into prison, but Pasiphae freed him from his chains" (Fabulae §40, trans. Mary Grant)

### Wings and Icarus's Fall (§40)

After Pasiphae freed him, "Daedalus made wings and fitted them to himself and to his son Icarus, and they flew away from that place."[^hyg-wings] But Icarus did not heed his father's warnings: "Icarus flew too high, and when the wax was melted by the sun, fell into the sea which was named Icarian for him."[^hyg-fall] Daedalus, however, "flew on to King Cocalus in the island of Sicily."[^hyg-sicily]

The Fabulae notes a variant tradition: "Others say that after [Theseus](theseus.md) killed the Minotaur he brought Daedalus back to Athens, his own country."[^hyg-variant]

[^hyg-wings]: "Daedalus made wings and fitted them to himself and to his son Icarus, and they flew away from that place" (Fabulae §40, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-fall]: "Icarus flew too high, and when the wax was melted by the sun, fell into the sea which was named Icarian for him" (Fabulae §40, trans. Mary Grant)

[^hyg-variant]: "Others say that after Theseus killed the Minotaur he brought Daedalus back to Athens, his own country" (Fabulae §40, trans. Mary Grant)

### Minos's Death at Cocalus's Court (§44)

The pursuit ended in Sicily: "[Minos](minos.md), because many misfortunes had come to him through the agency of Daedalus, followed him to Sicily, and asked King Cocalus to surrender him."[^hyg-pursuit] King Cocalus initially agreed: "When Cocalus had promised this, and Daedalus found it out, he sought help from the daughters of the king, and they killed [Minos](minos.md)."[^hyg-death-minos]

[^hyg-pursuit]: "Minos, because many misfortunes had come to him through the agency of Daedalus, followed him to Sicily, and asked King Cocalus to surrender him" (Fabulae §44, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-death-minos]: "When Cocalus had promised this, and Daedalus found it out, he sought help from the daughters of the king, and they killed Minos" (Fabulae §44, trans. Mary Grant)
