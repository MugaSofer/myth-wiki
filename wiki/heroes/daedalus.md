## Overview

**Daedalus** is a master craftsman — "an excellent architect and the first inventor of images" — who built the Labyrinth for [Minos](minos.md) to contain the Minotaur, constructed wings for himself and his son **Icarus** to escape Crete, and fled to Sicily where Minos pursued him to his death.

## In the Bibliotheca

### Exile from Athens (3.15.8)

Daedalus "had fled from Athens, because he had thrown down from the acropolis Talos, the son of his sister Perdix; for Talos was his pupil, and Daedalus feared that with his talents he might surpass himself, seeing that he had sawed a thin stick with a jawbone of a snake which he had found." The body was discovered, "Daedalus was tried in the Areopagus, and being condemned fled to Minos."[^apd-exile]

### The Wooden Cow and the Labyrinth (3.1.4, 3.15.8)

In Crete, Pasiphae "found an accomplice in Daedalus, an architect, who had been banished from Athens for murder. He constructed a wooden cow on wheels, took it, hollowed it out in the inside, sewed it up in the hide of a cow which he had skinned, and set it in the meadow in which the bull used to graze."[^apd-cow]

Pasiphae "gave birth to Asterius, who was called the Minotaur. He had the face of a bull, but the rest of him was human; and [Minos](minos.md), in compliance with certain oracles, shut him up and guarded him in the Labyrinth." The Labyrinth "was a chamber 'that with its tangled windings perplexed the outward way.'"[^apd-labyrinth]

### Ariadne's Clue (E.1.8-9)

When [Theseus](theseus.md) came to slay the Minotaur, [Ariadne](ariadne.md) "besought Daedalus to disclose the way out of the labyrinth. And at his suggestion she gave Theseus a clue when he went in; Theseus fastened it to the door, and, drawing it after him, entered in."[^apd-clue]

### The Flight (E.1.12-13)

After Theseus escaped, "Minos shut up the guilty Daedalus in the labyrinth, along with his son Icarus, who had been borne to Daedalus by Naucrate, a female slave of Minos."[^apd-imprisoned]

"Daedalus constructed wings for himself and his son, and enjoined his son, when he took to flight, neither to fly high, lest the glue should melt in the sun and the wings should drop off, nor to fly near the sea, lest the pinions should be detached by the damp."[^apd-wings]

"But the infatuated Icarus, disregarding his father's injunctions, soared ever higher, till, the glue melting, he fell into the sea called after him Icarian, and perished. But Daedalus made his way safely to Camicus in Sicily."[^apd-fall]

### The Spiral Shell and Minos's Death (E.1.14-15)

"Minos pursued Daedalus, and in every country that he searched he carried a spiral shell and promised to give a great reward to him who should pass a thread through the shell, believing that by that means he should discover Daedalus." When [Minos](minos.md) came to Camicus, Cocalus gave the shell to Daedalus, who "fastened a thread to an ant, and, having bored a hole in the spiral shell, allowed the ant to pass through it."[^apd-shell]

When Minos discovered Daedalus and demanded his surrender, "Cocalus promised to surrender him, and made an entertainment for Minos; but after his bath Minos was undone by the daughters of Cocalus; some say, however, that he died through being drenched with boiling water."[^apd-death]
