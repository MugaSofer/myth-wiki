## Overview

**Laocoon** was a Trojan priest who alone saw through the deception of the [Wooden Horse](../objects/wooden-horse.md) and urged his countrymen to burn it. For his defiance, [Athena](../deities/athena.md) struck him blind, and sent two monstrous serpents to devour his sons. His punishment — visited on the one man who spoke the truth — persuaded the Trojans to accept the Horse, sealing their fate.

## In the [Posthomerica](../sources/posthomerica.md)

### Warning Against the Horse (Book XII)

When [Sinon](sinon.md) told his false story about the Horse being an offering to [Athena](../deities/athena.md), "of the Trojans some believed him, others for a wily knave held him, of whose mind was Laocoon." He declared plainly: "A deadly fraud is this, devised by the Achaean chiefs!" and "cried to all straightway to burn the Horse, and know if aught within its timbers lurked."[^post-warning]

### Athena's Punishment (Book XII)

"Athena, fiercely wroth with him, the Trojans, and their city, shook earth's deep foundations 'neath Laocoon's feet." Terror fell on him: "round his head horror of darkness poured; a sharp pang thrilled his eyelids; swam his eyes beneath his brows; his eyeballs, stabbed with bitter anguish, throbbed even from the roots, and rolled in frenzy of pain." His eyes changed colour — "now bloodshot were his eyes, now ghastly green; anon with rheum they ran, as pours a stream down from a rugged crag." He seemed as a man distraught, "all things he saw showed double, and he groaned fearfully; yet he ceased not to exhort the men of Troy, and recked not of his pain. Then did the Goddess strike him utterly blind. Stared his fixed eyeballs white from pits of blood."[^post-blind]

The Trojans, seeing his punishment, feared they had offended Athena by tormenting Sinon. They pitied Laocoon and led Sinon "in friendly wise to Troy."[^post-pity]

### The Serpents and His Sons (Book XII)

Even blind, "Laocoon ceased not to exhort his countrymen to burn the Horse with fire: they would not hear, for dread of the Gods' wrath." Then Athena sent "a yet more hideous punishment" — two serpents from the brood of [Typhoeus](../creatures/typhoeus.md), dwelling in the rock-clefts of the isle Calydna. She summoned them to [Troy](../places/troy.md): "they shook the island as with earthquake: roared the sea; the waves disparted as they came. Onward they swept with fearful-flickering tongues: shuddered the very monsters of the deep."[^post-serpents]

"With grim jaws whetting their deadly fangs, on his hapless sons sprang they. All Trojans panic-stricken fled." No man dared stay: "ghastly dread laid hold on all shrinking in horror from the monsters." Only Laocoon and his sons remained, "for death's doom and the Goddess chained their feet." The serpents "seized and ravined up the twain, outstretching to their sightless sire agonized hands: no power to help had he." The serpents then vanished beneath the earth, entering the fane of [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) in Pergamus.[^post-sons]

The Trojans raised a cenotaph over the empty grave. "Over it their father from his blind eyes rained the tears: over the empty tomb their mother shrieked," mourning "the ruin wrought by folly of her lord" and "dreading the anger of the Blessed Ones." She is compared to a nightingale mourning fledglings taken by a serpent.[^post-tomb]

## In Other Sources

In the [Aeneid](../sources/aeneid.md) (Book II), Laocoon warns against the Horse with the famous line "I fear the Grecians even when they offer gifts." He hurls a spear into its side. Two sea-serpents then crush both Laocoon himself and his sons — unlike the Posthomerica, where only the sons are killed and Laocoon survives, blinded.

In the [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) (E.5.17-18), Laocoon is listed among those who warned the Trojans.

## Variant Traditions

The sources differ on Laocoon's fate:

- In the [Posthomerica](../sources/posthomerica.md), Athena blinds Laocoon and sends serpents that kill only his **sons**. Laocoon himself survives, blind and grieving.
- In the [Aeneid](../sources/aeneid.md), two sea-serpents kill both **Laocoon and his sons** together, crushing them in their coils.
