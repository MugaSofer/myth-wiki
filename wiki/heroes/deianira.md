## Overview

**Deianira** was the daughter of Oeneus of Calydon and the wife of [Heracles](heracles.md). She is best known for inadvertently causing her husband's death by sending him a tunic smeared with the poisoned blood of the centaur Nessus, believing it to be a love charm.

## In the Bibliotheca

### Marriage to Heracles

[Heracles](heracles.md) came to Calydon and wooed Deianira. He competed for her hand against the river-god Achelous, who "assumed the likeness of a bull; but Hercules broke off one of his horns."[^apd-dei-achelous]

### The Centaur Nessus

After Heracles accidentally killed a kinsman of Oeneus and chose exile, he departed for Trachis with Deianira. At the river Evenus, "the centaur Nessus sat and ferried passengers across for hire, alleging that he had received the ferry from the gods for his righteousness."[^apd-dei-nessus1] Heracles crossed by himself but entrusted Deianira to Nessus. "But he, in ferrying her across, attempted to violate her. She cried out, Hercules heard her, and shot Nessus to the heart when he emerged from the river."[^apd-dei-nessus2]

As he lay dying, Nessus told Deianira "that if she would have a love charm to operate on Hercules she should mix the seed he had dropped on the ground with the blood that flowed from the wound inflicted by the barb. She did so and kept it by her."[^apd-dei-charm]

### The Shirt of Nessus

Years later, when Heracles captured Oechalia and led Iole captive, Deianira learned of it from the herald Lichas. "Fearing that Hercules might love that damsel more than herself, she supposed that the spilt blood of Nessus was in truth a love-charm, and with it she smeared the tunic."[^apd-dei-shirt] The tunic's poison — the gall of the [Hydra](../creatures/hydra.md), which had been on the arrow that killed Nessus — corroded Heracles' skin when it was warmed.

"Deianira, on learning what had happened, hanged herself."[^apd-dei-death]

## In the Fabulae

### Marriage Contest with the Centaur (§33)

The [Fabulae](../sources/hyginus.md) tells how [Heracles](heracles.md) won Deianira from a centaur rival: "When [Heracles](heracles.md) had come to the court of King Dexamenus and had violated his daughter Deianira, promising he would marry her, Eurytion a centaur, son of Ixion and Nubes, after his departure sought Deianira as a wife."[^hyg-eurytion] King Dexamenus, "fearing violence, promised her to him. On the appointed day he came with his brothers to the wedding. [Heracles](heracles.md) intervened, and killed the Centaur, and led home his betrothed."[^hyg-wedding]

[^hyg-eurytion]: "When Hercules had come to the court of King Dexamenus and had violated his daughter Deianira, promising he would marry her, Eurytion a centaur, son of Ixion and Nubes, after his departure sought Deianira as a wife" (Fabulae §33, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-wedding]: "Her father, fearing violence, promised her to him. On the appointed day he came with his brothers to the wedding. Hercules intervened, and killed the Centaur, and led home his betrothed" (Fabulae §33, trans. Mary Grant)

### Nessus and the Poisoned Blood (§34)

At the river Evenus, "Nessus, son of Ixion and Nubes, a centaur, was asked by Deianira to carry her across the river Evenus, but as he was carrying her, in the very river he tried to ravish her."[^hyg-nessus-attack] When Heracles shot him with his arrows, Nessus, "knowing how poisonous the arrows were, since they had been dipped in the gall of the Lernaean Hydra, drew out some of his blood and gave it to Deianira, telling her it was a love-charm."[^hyg-blood] The deception was complete: "If she wanted her husband not to desert her, she should have his garments smeared with this blood. Deianira, believing him, kept it carefully preserved."[^hyg-charm]

[^hyg-nessus-attack]: "Nessus, son of Ixion and Nubes, a centaur, was asked by Deianira to carry her across the river Evenus, but as he was carrying her, in the very river he tried to ravish her" (Fabulae §34, trans. Mary Grant)

[^hyg-charm]: "If she wanted her husband not to desert her, she should have his garments smeared with this blood. Deianira, believing him, kept it carefully preserved" (Fabulae §34, trans. Mary Grant)

### Iole and the Poisoned Robe (§35-36)

Years later, "[Heracles](heracles.md), when he had sought in marriage Iole, daughter of Eurytus, and had been refused, attacked Oichalia."[^hyg-oichalia] When Eurytus would not yield, Heracles "threatened to kill her relatives in her presence. She, with resolute mind, suffered them to be slain before her eyes. When he had killed them all, he sent Iole as captive before him to Deianira."[^hyg-iole]

When Deianira saw Iole's beauty, she feared losing her husband and "mindful of the instructions of Nessus, she sent a servant named Lichas to take to [Heracles](heracles.md) a robe dipped in the blood of the centaur."[^hyg-robe] But before Lichas departed, "a little of it fell to the earth, and when the sun touched it, it began to burn. When Deianira saw this, she knew that Nessus had spoken falsely."[^hyg-test] She sent word to recall the messenger, but it was too late.

When Heracles put on the robe, "it started at once to blaze; when he leaped into a stream to put out the blaze, still greater flames burst forth; when he tried to take off the garment the flesh came with it."[^hyg-burning] In his agony, "[Heracles](heracles.md), whirling Lichas, who had brought the garment, round and round, threw him into the sea, and at the place where he fell a rock appeared which is called Lichas."[^hyg-lichas]

[Philoctetes](philoctetes.md) built a pyre for Heracles on Mount Oeta, and Heracles "mounted it... and cast off his mortality." For this service Heracles "gave [Philoctetes](philoctetes.md) his bow and arrows. But Deianira, because of what had happened to [Heracles](heracles.md), killed herself."[^hyg-death]

[^hyg-oichalia]: "Hercules, when he had sought in marriage Iole, daughter of Eurytus, and had been refused, attacked Oichalia" (Fabulae §35, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-iole]: "In order to bend the girl to his will, he threatened to kill her relatives in her presence. She, with resolute mind, suffered them to be slain before her eyes. When he had killed them all, he sent Iole as captive before him to Dejanira" (Fabulae §35, trans. Mary Grant)

For this service he gave Philoctetes his bow and arrows. But Dejanira, because of what had happened to Hercules, killed herself" (Fabulae §36, trans. Mary Grant)

## In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md)

### The Contest for Deianira (9.1-100)

[Achelous](../deities/achelous.md) narrates his contest with [Heracles](heracles.md) for Deianira, describing her as "the envied hope of many. She was then a lovely virgin."[^met-dei-beauty] The contest culminated in a wrestling match where Achelous shifted shapes — first to a serpent, then a bull — before Heracles broke off one of his horns.

### Nessus at the River (9.101-133)

At the river Evenus, the centaur Nessus attempted to carry Deianira across but betrayed the trust. Heracles shot him through the back with a poisoned arrow. The dying Nessus "gave his tunic, soaked with blood to Deianira as a gift; and said, 'Keep this to strengthen waning love.'"[^met-dei-tunic]

### The Poisoned Robe (9.134-175)

When Rumor told Deianira that Heracles was in love with Iole, she was at first "dissolved in tears" but then steeled herself. Ovid gives her an extended internal monologue: "Why should I give up to my sorrow while I drown my wretched spirit in weak tears? Let me consider an effectual check... shall I be silent or complain of it? Must I go back to Calydon or stay?"[^met-dei-monologue] She considered violent revenge — "O shade of Meleager, let me prove I am yet worthy to be called your sister" — before deciding to send the tunic: "at last her mind fixed on one thought: — she might still keep his love, could certainly restore it, if she sent to him the tunic soaked in Nessus' blood."[^met-dei-decision]

She gave the tunic to Lichas "unknowingly" — emphasising her innocence in the catastrophe that followed.

[^met-dei-tunic]: "he gave his tunic, soaked with blood to Deianira as a gift; and said, 'Keep this to strengthen waning love'" (Metamorphoses 9.131-133)

[^met-dei-decision]: "at last her mind fixed on one thought: — she might still keep his love, could certainly restore it, if she sent to him the tunic soaked in Nessus' blood. Unknowingly, she gave the fatal cause of her own woe to trusting Lichas" (Metamorphoses 9.155-159)
