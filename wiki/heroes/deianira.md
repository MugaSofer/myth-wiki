## Overview

**Deianira** was the daughter of Oeneus of Calydon and the wife of [Heracles](heracles.md). She is best known for inadvertently causing her husband's death by sending him a tunic smeared with the poisoned blood of the centaur Nessus, believing it to be a love charm.

## In the Bibliotheca

### Marriage to Heracles

[Heracles](heracles.md) came to Calydon and wooed Deianira. He competed for her hand against the river-god Achelous, who "assumed the likeness of a bull; but Hercules broke off one of his horns."[^apd-dei-achelous]

### The Centaur Nessus

After Heracles accidentally killed a kinsman of Oeneus and chose exile, he departed for Trachis with Deianira. At the river Evenus, "the centaur Nessus sat and ferried passengers across for hire, alleging that he had received the ferry from the gods for his righteousness."[^apd-dei-nessus1] Heracles crossed by himself but entrusted Deianira to Nessus. "But he, in ferrying her across, attempted to violate her. She cried out, Hercules heard her, and shot Nessus to the heart when he emerged from the river."[^apd-dei-nessus2]

As he lay dying, Nessus told Deianira "that if she would have a love charm to operate on Hercules she should mix the seed he had dropped on the ground with the blood that flowed from the wound inflicted by the barb. She did so and kept it by her."[^apd-dei-charm]

### The Shirt of Nessus

Years later, when Heracles captured Oechalia and led Iole captive, Deianira learned of it from the herald Lichas. "Fearing that Hercules might love that damsel more than herself, she supposed that the spilt blood of Nessus was in truth a love-charm, and with it she smeared the tunic."[^apd-dei-shirt] The tunic's poison — the gall of the [Hydra](../creatures/hydra.md), which had been on the arrow that killed Nessus — corroded Heracles' skin when it was warmed.

"Deianira, on learning what had happened, hanged herself."[^apd-dei-death]
