## Overview

**Polyneices** was the elder son of [Oedipus](../heroes/oedipus.md) and [Jocasta](../heroes/jocasta.md), and brother to [Eteocles](../heroes/eteocles.md), [Antigone](../heroes/antigone.md), and [Ismene](../heroes/ismene.md). Expelled from [Thebes](../places/thebes.md) by his younger brother, he assembled the [Seven against Thebes](../events/seven-against-thebes.md) to reclaim the throne, sought his father's blessing at Colonus and received a curse instead, and died in single combat with Eteocles. The refusal of his corpse a proper burial sets the action of Sophocles' Antigone in motion.

## In the Bibliotheca

Apollodorus names Polyneices as one of Oedipus's sons. After Oedipus died, "his sons Eteocles and Polynices came to blows with each other" over the kingship (3.6.1). Polyneices, the elder, was driven out. He went to Argos, married the daughter of King Adrastus, and with Adrastus's support assembled a force of seven champions to march against Thebes. In the siege, Polyneices killed Eteocles in single combat and was himself killed by him.[^apd-war]

After the battle, Creon refused the invaders burial. Antigone secretly buried Polyneices and was caught.[^apd-burial]

The Bibliotheca also notes that when Oedipus "saw them to have disregarded him" in his exile, he cursed his sons, and the curse was connected to a dispute over inheritance (3.5.9).[^apd-curse]

## In the Fabulae

Hyginus records the fraternal conflict in §§68-69. The brothers agreed to rule Thebes in alternating years; Eteocles, ruling first, refused to give up the throne when his year expired, and expelled Polyneices. Polyneices went to Argos, where Adrastus received him and "gave him his daughter Argeia in marriage." He assembled the seven champions and marched on Thebes.[^hyg-backstory]

Both brothers fell in single combat, and Creon, assuming power, denied burial to Polyneices and the other Argive leaders.[^hyg-death]

## In Sophocles' Oedipus at Colonus

[Ismene](../heroes/ismene.md) reports that after their father's expulsion, Polyneices and Eteocles initially agreed to leave the throne to [Creon](../heroes/creon.md), but were later seized by a "mad rivalry / To grasp at sovereignty and kingly power." The younger brother expelled the elder: "Today the hot-branded youth, the younger born, / Is keeping Polyneices from the throne, / His elder, and has thrust him from the land."[^soc-rivalry] Polyneices fled to Argos, married into the royal house there, and "swears he will stablish Argos straight as lord / Of the Cadmeian land."[^soc-flight]

Polyneices himself arrives at Colonus as a suppliant under the protection of [Theseus](../heroes/theseus.md), having been raised from the altar of Poseidon to speak. He enters weeping and describes his father's condition — "a castaway, with you, / In a strange land, an ancient beggar clad / In antic tatters" — and confesses his neglect: "All this too late I learn, wretch that I am."[^soc-arrival]

He states his case: expelled by Eteocles "not by weight of precedent, / Nor by the last arbitrament of war, / But by his popular acts," he came to Argos, married the daughter of King Adrastus, and enlisted "the foremost captains of the Apian isle."[^soc-plea] He names the Seven: Amphiaraus, Tydeus, Eteoclus, Hippomedon, Capaneus, Parthenopaeus, and himself.[^soc-seven] He appeals to Oedipus for his blessing, which the oracles say will decide the campaign's outcome.

Oedipus refuses with devastating force, cataloguing his sons' abandonment of him during his exile: "Thou art my murderer; thou didst thrust me out."[^soc-curse] He invokes a curse — that neither son shall win and they shall kill each other: "Never to win by arms thy native land, / No, nor return to Argos in the Vale, / But by a kinsman's hand to die and slay / Him who expelled thee."[^soc-doom]

Polyneices turns to his sisters and asks that if the curse is fulfilled and they return to Thebes, they grant him burial. He acknowledges Antigone's plea to turn back the army but refuses: "How could I lead again / An army that had seen their leader quail?"[^soc-refusal] He departs knowing he goes to his death.

## In Sophocles' Antigone

Polyneices does not appear as a character in Antigone but is central to its conflict. [Creon](../heroes/creon.md) describes him as "the miscreant exile who returned / Minded in flames and ashes to blot out / His father's city and his father's gods" and decrees that his body "shall not be buried."[^sa-edict] [Antigone](../heroes/antigone.md) refers to burying "my dearest brother" and justifies the act: "And last, my Polyneices, unto thee / I paid due rites."[^sa-antigone]

The chorus recalls the battle: "Save two alone, that ill-starred pair / One mother to one father bare, / Who lance in rest, one 'gainst the other / Drave, and both perished, brother slain by brother."[^sa-chorus]

## Variant Traditions

Apollodorus notes that some say the children were borne not by Jocasta but by Eurygania, daughter of Hyperphas (3.5.8). The question of which brother proposed the alternating-year arrangement — and which broke it — varies by source.
