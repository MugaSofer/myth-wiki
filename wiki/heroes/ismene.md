## Overview

**Ismene** was a daughter of [Oedipus](../heroes/oedipus.md) and [Jocasta](../heroes/jocasta.md), and sister to [Antigone](../heroes/antigone.md), [Polyneices](../heroes/polyneices.md), and [Eteocles](../heroes/eteocles.md). In Sophocles' trilogy she appears first as a young child at [Thebes](../places/thebes.md), then as a devoted daughter who travels alone to bring her exiled father news, and finally as a foil to Antigone — the cautious sister who refuses the act of defiance, then attempts to claim a share of its punishment.

## In the Bibliotheca

Apollodorus names Ismene as one of Oedipus's four children by Jocasta.[^apd-ismene]

## In Sophocles' Oedipus the King

Ismene appears only briefly at the end of the play, led in as a child alongside Antigone so that the blinded Oedipus may embrace his daughters one last time. Oedipus speaks of them: "But for my daughters twain, poor innocent maids, / Who ever sat beside me at the board / Sharing my viands, drinking of my cup, / For them, I pray thee, care."[^sot-daughters]

## In Sophocles' Oedipus at Colonus

Ismene arrives at Colonus riding alone — Antigone spots her approaching on horseback, wearing a broad Thessalian hat against the sun: "She wears for headgear a Thessalian hat / To shade her from the sun."[^soc-arrival] She has come from Thebes to deliver news in person, accompanied by only one loyal servant. Oedipus praises her for having gone previously to Thebes to bring him oracles, "Eluding the Cadmeians' vigilance, / To bring thy father all the oracles / Concerning Oedipus."[^soc-service]

She reports that Oedipus's sons, initially willing to leave the throne to [Creon](../heroes/creon.md), have now fallen into rivalry over power; the younger, [Eteocles](../heroes/eteocles.md), has expelled the elder, [Polyneices](../heroes/polyneices.md), who has fled to Argos and assembled an army. She also relays the latest oracle from Delphi: Thebes will one day seek Oedipus for the sake of his grave, since victory in battle will depend on whoever possesses it.[^soc-oracle]

When [Creon](../heroes/creon.md) arrives and resorts to force, his guards seize Ismene — she is already in custody before Creon publicly takes Antigone. The play's argument notes that Creon's men "seize Antigone and carry her off (Ismene, the other sister, they have already captured)."[^soc-seized] Theseus later rescues both sisters.

## In Sophocles' Antigone

Ismene opens the play in conversation with Antigone, who has summoned her privately outside the gates to reveal Creon's edict forbidding burial of Polyneices. Ismene recounts their losses: "since we twain / Were reft of our two brethren in one day / By double fratricide."[^sa-twain]

When Antigone asks for her help, Ismene refuses, citing powerlessness against the law: "weak women, think of that, / Not framed by nature to contend with men. / Remember this too that the stronger rules; / We must obey his orders, these or worse."[^sa-refusal] She does not betray her sister and urges secrecy instead. Antigone rejects her counsel entirely, choosing to act openly.

After Antigone is caught and brought before Creon, Ismene enters and attempts to claim shared guilt: "I did the deed, if she will have it so, / And with my sister claim to share the guilt."[^sa-claim] Antigone refuses to allow it: "That were unjust. Thou would'st not act with me / At first, and I refused thy partnership."[^sa-reject] When Ismene presses further — "O sister, scorn me not, let me but share / Thy work of piety, and with thee die" — Antigone again denies her: "Claim not a work in which thou hadst no hand; / One death sufficeth."[^sa-one-death]

Ismene asks what life holds for her without her sister. When Creon dismisses the matter, Ismene reminds him that Antigone is "thy own son's plighted bride."[^sa-bride] Creon is unmoved.
