## Overview

**The Sibyl of Cumae** was a prophetess of [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md), dwelling in a vast cavern at Cumae. She guided [Aeneas](aeneas.md) through the underworld and is notable for a devastating bargain with Apollo: she was granted as many years of life as grains in a handful of sand, but forgot to ask for eternal youth.

## In the [Aeneid](../sources/aeneid.md)

### Priestess of Apollo and Trivia (Book VI)

The [Aeneid](../sources/aeneid.md) identifies the Sibyl as "the priestess of Phoebus and Trivia, Deïphobe daughter of Glaucus."[^aen-sib-name] She dwells in "the lone mystery of the awful Sibyl's cavern depth, over whose mind and soul the prophetic Delian breathes high inspiration and reveals futurity."[^aen-sib-cavern]

### The Prophetic Frenzy

When [Aeneas](aeneas.md) reaches the threshold, the Sibyl is seized by [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md): "suddenly countenance nor colour nor ranged tresses stayed the same; her wild heart heaves madly in her panting bosom; and she expands to sight, and her voice is more than mortal, now the god breathes on her in nearer deity."[^aen-sib-frenzy] Even after speaking, "the prophetess, not yet tame to Phoebus' hand, rages fiercely in the cavern, so she may shake the mighty godhead from her breast; so much the more does he tire her maddened mouth and subdue her wild breast and shape her to his pressure."[^aen-sib-struggle]

### The Prophecy and the Golden Bough

Through the Sibyl, Apollo delivers the prophecy for Italy: "Wars, grim wars I discern, and Tiber afoam with streams of blood... another Achilles is already found for Latium, he too goddess-born; nor shall Juno's presence ever leave the Teucrians."[^aen-sib-prophecy]

She then points out the golden bough in the woods of [Juno](../deities/hera.md) of Avernus and commands him to pluck it — the key to entering the underworld.[^aen-sib-bough] With the bough secured, she guides Aeneas through the realm of the dead to find his father Anchises in [Elysium](../places/elysium.md).

[^aen-sib-struggle]: "the prophetess, not yet tame to Phoebus' hand, rages fiercely in the cavern, so she may shake the mighty godhead from her breast; so much the more does he tire her maddened mouth and subdue her wild breast and shape her to his pressure" (Aeneid 6.77-80)

## In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md)

### Apollo's Offer and the Grains of Sand (14.101-153)

In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md), the Sibyl tells [Aeneas](aeneas.md) her own story. She denies being a goddess: "I am no goddess, nor is it well to honor any mortal head with tribute of the holy frankincense."[^met-sib-mortal]

[Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) had offered her eternal life in exchange for her virginity: "life eternal without end was offered to me, if I would but yield virginity to Phoebus for his love." He attempted to bribe her: "Maiden of Cumae choose whatever you may wish, and you shall gain all that you wish."[^met-sib-offer]

She pointed to a heap of dust and asked for as many years as there were grains of sand — "but I forgot to wish them days of changeless youth." Apollo offered youth as well if she would yield to him, but she refused: "He gave long life and offered youth besides, if I would grant his wish. This I refused, I live unwedded still."[^met-sib-youth]

By the time of Aeneas's visit, she has lived seven centuries with three hundred more to come: "You find me ending seven long centuries, and there remain for me, before my years equal the number of those grains of sand, three hundred harvests, three hundred vintages!"[^met-sib-centuries]

She prophesies her own fate — to shrink until she is nothing but a voice: "The time will come, when long increase of days will so contract me from my present size and so far waste away my limbs with age that I shall dwindle to a trifling weight, so trifling, it will never be believed I once was loved and even pleased a god. Perhaps, even Phoebus will not recognize me, or will deny he ever bore me love. But, though I change till eye would never know me, my voice shall live, the fates will leave my voice."[^met-sib-voice]

[^met-sib-voice]: "The time will come, when long increase of days will so contract me from my present size and so far waste away my limbs with age that I shall dwindle to a trifling weight, so trifling, it will never be believed I once was loved and even pleased a god. Perhaps, even Phoebus will not recognize me, or will deny he ever bore me love. But, though I change till eye would never know me, my voice shall live, the fates will leave my voice" (Metamorphoses 14.155-163)
