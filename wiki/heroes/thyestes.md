## Overview

**Thyestes** was the son of [Pelops](pelops.md) and brother of [Atreus](atreus.md). Their rivalry for the throne of Mycenae produced the most horrific crime in the cursed House of Atreus: Thyestes seduced his brother's wife and stole the golden lamb, but Atreus, after reclaiming the throne through [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md)'s intervention, slaughtered Thyestes' children and served them to their father at a feast. Thyestes' curse on the house of Pelops drove the cycle of vengeance through subsequent generations.

## In the Iliad

Thyestes appears in the lineage of the divine sceptre: "Atreus dying left it to Thyestes rich in flocks, and Thyestes in his turn left it to [Agamemnon](agamemnon.md) to bear."[^il2-sceptre]

## In the Bibliotheca

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) gives the full sequence of the brothers' conflict. Thyestes seduced Atreus's wife Aerope and through her gained possession of the golden lamb that Atreus had promised to [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md). He used the lamb to claim the throne, but [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) reversed the sun's course to vindicate Atreus.[^apd-sun]

Atreus then took terrible revenge: "he slaughtered the sons, Aglaus, Callileon, and Orchomenus... And having cut them limb from limb and boiled them, he served them up to Thyestes without the extremities; and when Thyestes had eaten heartily of them, he showed him the extremities."[^apd-feast]

Following an oracle, Thyestes fathered [Aegisthus](aegisthus.md) upon his own daughter Pelopia in order to produce an avenger. The infant was exposed but rescued and raised by Atreus as his own. When Aegisthus learned his true parentage, he slew Atreus, and Thyestes reclaimed the throne.[^apd-aegisthus]

After [Agamemnon](agamemnon.md) and [Menelaus](menelaus.md) were restored by Tyndareus, "they drove away Thyestes to dwell in Cytheria."[^apd-exile] Clytemnestra had first been married to Thyestes' son Tantalus before Agamemnon killed him.[^apd-tantalus]

## In Aeschylus' Agamemnon

[Aegisthus](aegisthus.md) recounts his father's suffering: [Atreus](atreus.md) "feigned to hold in loyal joy a day of festal cheer" and set before Thyestes "flesh that was his children once." When Thyestes discovered the truth, "with horror's bitter cry back-starting, spewing forth the fragments foul, on Pelops' house a deadly curse he spake."[^ag-feast] Aegisthus claims Agamemnon's murder as the fulfillment of that curse.

[Cassandra](cassandra.md) sees the same horror in vision: the children as ghosts, "their hands are full / Of their own flesh."[^ag-cassandra]

[^il2-sceptre]: "Atreus dying left it to Thyestes rich in flocks, and Thyestes in his turn left it to Agamemnon to bear, that over many islands and all Argos he should be lord" (Iliad 2.107-112, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^apd-sun]: "Zeus sent Hermes to Atreus and told him to stipulate with Thyestes that Atreus should be king if the sun should go backward; and when Thyestes agreed, the sun set in the east" (Bibliotheca E.2.12, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-feast]: "he slaughtered the sons, Aglaus, Callileon, and Orchomenus... And having cut them limb from limb and boiled them, he served them up to Thyestes without the extremities; and when Thyestes had eaten heartily of them, he showed him the extremities" (Bibliotheca E.2.13, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-aegisthus]: Bibliotheca E.2.14, trans. J.G. Frazer
[^apd-exile]: "they drove away Thyestes to dwell in Cytheria" (Bibliotheca E.2.15, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-tantalus]: "Agamemnon getting Clytaemnestra to wife, after he had slain her spouse Tantalus, the son of Thyestes, together with his newborn babe" (Bibliotheca E.2.15, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^ag-feast]: "flesh that was his children once... with horror's bitter cry back-starting, spewing forth the fragments foul, on Pelops' house a deadly curse he spake" (Agamemnon ~1577-1600, trans. E.D.A. Morshead)
[^ag-cassandra]: Agamemnon ~1095-1100, trans. E.D.A. Morshead
