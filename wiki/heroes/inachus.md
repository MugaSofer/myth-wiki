## Overview

**Inachus** was a river god of [Argos](../places/argos.md), son of the Titans [Ocean](../deities/ocean.md) and [Tethys](../deities/tethys.md). He was father of Phoroneus and ancestor of the Argive royal line. His most prominent role in mythology is as father (or alleged father) of [Io](io.md), the mortal woman transformed into a cow by [Hera's](../deities/hera.md) jealousy. A river in Argos is named after him.

## In the Bibliotheca

### Genealogy and Children

According to Apollodorus, "Ocean and Tethys had a son Inachus, after whom a river in Argos is called Inachus. He and Melia, daughter of Ocean, had sons, Phoroneus, and Aegialeus."[^apd-genealogy] Phoroneus went on to rule the land later called the Peloponnese, while "Aegialeus having died childless, the whole country was called Aegialia."[^apd-aegialeus]

### Io's Parentage: Variant Traditions

Inachus is implicated in competing traditions about [Io's](io.md) parentage. Apollodorus notes that "Argus and Ismene, daughter of Asopus, had a son Iasus, who is said to have been the father of Io. But the annalist Castor and many of the tragedians allege that Io was a daughter of Inachus; and Hesiod and Acusilaus say that she was a daughter of Piren."[^apd-io-variants]

Additionally, Apollodorus records a variant about the identity of Argus, [Io's](io.md) guardian. While some sources claim Argus was "a son of Arestor," others report that "Asclepiades says that he was a son of Inachus."[^apd-argus-variants]

### Poseidon's Wrath

Inachus plays a crucial role in the geography of [Argos](../places/argos.md) through an act of testimony that angered [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md). When [Danaus](danaus.md) brought his fifty daughters to [Argos](../places/argos.md), they found "the country being waterless, because Poseidon had dried up even the springs out of anger at Inachus for testifying that the land belonged to [Hera](../deities/hera.md)."[^apd-poseidon] This divine punishment explains why [Danaus](danaus.md) "sent his daughters to draw water,"[^apd-water] initiating the story of the Danaids.

## In Aeschylus' Suppliant Maidens

The Danaids invoke Inachus by name as they appeal for protection in [Argos](../places/argos.md). Recognizing their descent from [Io](io.md), who wandered to Egypt and became ancestress of [Danaus](danaus.md), they appeal to "the waters wan Of Inachus, and gods most high" for aid.[^sm-inachus] This invocation acknowledges both Inachus' role as the river of their ancestral homeland and his connection to [Io](io.md).

## In Prometheus Bound

[Aeschylus](../sources/aeschylus-prometheus-bound.md) refers to the genealogy tracing from [Io](io.md) to the Danaids: "And from Epaphus sprang Libya, and from Libya, Belus; and from Belus, Aegyptus and Danaus."[^pb-genealogy] This passage, while not mentioning Inachus directly, establishes the connection between [Io](io.md) (whose father or alternative paternity is disputed between Inachus and others) and the royal houses of Egypt and [Argos](../places/argos.md).

[^apd-aegialeus]: "Aegialeus having died childless, the whole country was called Aegialia; and Phoroneus, reigning over the whole land afterwards named Peloponnese, begat Apis and Niobe by a nymph Teledice" (Bibliotheca 2.1.1, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-io-variants]: "Argus and Ismene, daughter of Asopus, had a son Iasus, who is said to have been the father of Io. But the annalist Castor and many of the tragedians allege that Io was a daughter of Inachus; and Hesiod and Acusilaus say that she was a daughter of Piren" (Bibliotheca 2.1.3, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-argus-variants]: "Pherecydes says that this Argus was a son of Arestor; but Asclepiades says that he was a son of Inachus" (Bibliotheca 2.1.3, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-poseidon]: "the country being waterless, because Poseidon had dried up even the springs out of anger at Inachus for testifying that the land belonged to Hera" (Bibliotheca 2.1.4, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-water]: "Danaus sent his daughters to draw water" (Bibliotheca 2.1.4, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^sm-inachus]: "City, and land, and waters wan Of Inachus, and gods most high" (Suppliant Maidens ~469-470, trans. E.D.A. Morshead)
[^pb-genealogy]: "And from Epaphus sprang Libya, and from Libya, Belus; and from Belus, Aegyptus and Danaus" (Prometheus Bound, Argument, trans. E.D.A. Morshead)
