## Overview

**Creon** was the king of [Corinth](../places/corinth.md) during the time when [Jason](../heroes/jason.md) and [Medea](../heroes/medea.md) came to the city after fleeing Colchis. He is primarily remembered for his decision to betroth his daughter Glauce to the famous hero [Jason](../heroes/jason.md), and for his own death as a consequence of [Medea](../heroes/medea.md)'s terrible revenge.

## In the Bibliotheca

When [Jason](../heroes/jason.md) and [Medea](../heroes/medea.md) arrived in Corinth, they lived peacefully for a time: "They went to Corinth, and lived there happily for ten years, till Creon, king of Corinth, betrothed his daughter Glauce to Jason, who married her and divorced Medea."[^apd-betrothal]

However, "[Medea] invoked the gods by whom Jason had sworn, and after often upbraiding him with his ingratitude she sent the bride a robe steeped in poison, which when Glauce had put on, she was consumed with fierce fire along with her father, who went to her rescue."[^apd-death]
