## Overview

**Danae** was a princess of Argos, daughter of King Acrisius. Imprisoned by her father to prevent a prophecy that her son would kill him, she was nonetheless visited by [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) in the form of golden rain and bore [Perseus](perseus.md).

## In the [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md)

### The Oracle and Imprisonment

Acrisius, seeking male children, was told by the oracle "that his daughter would give birth to a son who would kill him."[^apd-dan-oracle] In response, "Acrisius built a brazen chamber under ground and there guarded Danae."[^apd-dan-chamber]

### Zeus and Perseus

Despite the imprisonment, Danae conceived. Apollodorus notes a variant tradition: she "was seduced, as some say, by Proetus, whence arose the quarrel between them; but some say that Zeus had intercourse with her in the shape of a stream of gold which poured through the roof into Danae's lap."[^apd-dan-zeus] She bore a son, [Perseus](perseus.md).

### Cast to Sea

Acrisius "would not believe that she had been seduced by Zeus, and putting his daughter with the child in a chest, he cast it into the sea."[^apd-dan-chest] The chest washed ashore on Seriphus, where Dictys rescued and reared the boy.

### On Seriphus

Polydectes, king of Seriphus, desired Danae but could not reach her because [Perseus](perseus.md) protected her. After Perseus was sent away on the Gorgon quest, Danae and Dictys "had taken refuge at the altars on account of the violence of Polydectes."[^apd-dan-altars] She was freed when Perseus returned and turned Polydectes to stone.

Danae's parentage is given earlier in the text: "Acrisius had a daughter Danae by Eurydice, daughter of Lacedaemon."[^apd-dan-parentage]
