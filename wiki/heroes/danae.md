## Overview

**Danae** was a princess of Argos, daughter of King Acrisius. Imprisoned by her father to prevent a prophecy that her son would kill him, she was nonetheless visited by [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) in the form of golden rain and bore [Perseus](perseus.md).

## In the [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md)

### The Oracle and Imprisonment

Acrisius, seeking male children, was told by the oracle "that his daughter would give birth to a son who would kill him."[^apd-dan-oracle] In response, "Acrisius built a brazen chamber under ground and there guarded Danae."[^apd-dan-chamber]

### Zeus and Perseus

Despite the imprisonment, Danae conceived. Apollodorus notes a variant tradition: she "was seduced, as some say, by Proetus, whence arose the quarrel between them; but some say that Zeus had intercourse with her in the shape of a stream of gold which poured through the roof into Danae's lap."[^apd-dan-zeus] She bore a son, [Perseus](perseus.md).

### Cast to Sea

Acrisius "would not believe that she had been seduced by Zeus, and putting his daughter with the child in a chest, he cast it into the sea."[^apd-dan-chest] The chest washed ashore on Seriphus, where Dictys rescued and reared the boy.

### On Seriphus

Polydectes, king of Seriphus, desired Danae but could not reach her because [Perseus](perseus.md) protected her. After Perseus was sent away on the Gorgon quest, Danae and Dictys "had taken refuge at the altars on account of the violence of Polydectes."[^apd-dan-altars] She was freed when Perseus returned and turned Polydectes to stone.

Danae's parentage is given earlier in the text: "Acrisius had a daughter Danae by Eurydice, daughter of Lacedaemon."[^apd-dan-parentage]

[^apd-dan-oracle]: "When Acrisius inquired of the oracle how he should get male children, the god said that his daughter would give birth to a son who would kill him" (Bibliotheca 2.4.1, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-dan-chamber]: "Acrisius built a brazen chamber under ground and there guarded Danae" (Bibliotheca 2.4.1)
[^apd-dan-zeus]: "she was seduced, as some say, by Proetus, whence arose the quarrel between them; but some say that Zeus had intercourse with her in the shape of a stream of gold which poured through the roof into Danae's lap" (Bibliotheca 2.4.1)
[^apd-dan-chest]: "he would not believe that she had been seduced by Zeus, and putting his daughter with the child in a chest, he cast it into the sea" (Bibliotheca 2.4.1)
[^apd-dan-altars]: "his mother and Dictys had taken refuge at the altars on account of the violence of Polydectes" (Bibliotheca 2.4.3)
[^apd-dan-parentage]: "Acrisius had a daughter Danae by Eurydice, daughter of Lacedaemon" (Bibliotheca 2.2.1)

## In the Fabulae

The [Fabulae](../sources/hyginus.md) gives a complete narrative with several distinctive details about the aftermath of Perseus's birth.

### The Prophecy and Imprisonment

"Danae was the daughter of Acrisius and Aganippe. A prophecy about her said that the child she bore would kill Acrisius, and Acrisius, fearing this, shut her in a stone-walled prison."[^hyg-63-prison] The Fabulae names her mother as Aganippe (rather than Eurydice) and specifies a "stone-walled prison" rather than the Bibliotheca's "brazen chamber under ground."

### Zeus and Birth

"But Jove, changing into a shower of gold, lay with Danae, and from this embrace Perseus was born."[^hyg-63-birth]

### Cast to Sea

"Because of her sin her father shut her up in a chest with Perseus and cast it into the sea."[^hyg-63-chest]

### Arrival at Seriphus

"By Jove's will it was borne to the island of Seriphos, and when the fisherman Dictys found it and broke it open, he discovered the mother and child. He took them to King Polydectes, who married Danae and brought up Perseus in the temple of Minerva."[^hyg-63-rescue]

> **VARIANT:** The Fabulae uniquely states that Polydectes "married Danae" rather than merely desiring her. It also specifies Perseus was raised "in the temple of Minerva" — a detail not found in other sources.

### Acrisius Comes to Seriphus

"When Acrisius discovered they were staying at Polydectes' court, he started out to get them, but at his arrival Polydectes interceded for them, and Perseus swore an oath to his grandfather that he would never kill him."[^hyg-63-oath]

### The Prophecy Fulfilled

"When Acrisius was detained there by a storm, Polydectes died, and at his funeral games the wind blew a discus from Perseus' hand at Acrisius' head which killed him."[^hyg-63-death] The Fabulae gives specific circumstances: Acrisius is detained by a storm when Polydectes dies, and at the funeral games the wind itself causes the fatal accident.

"Thus what he did not do of his own will was accomplished by the gods. When Polydectes was buried, Perseus set out for Argos and took possession of his grandfather's kingdom."[^hyg-63-kingdom]

[^hyg-63-prison]: "Danae was the daughter of Acrisius and Aganippe. A prophecy about her said that the child she bore would kill Acrisius, and Acrisius, fearing this, shut her in a stone-walled prison" (Fabulae §63, trans. Mary Grant)
