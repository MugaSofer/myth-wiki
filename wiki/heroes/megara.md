## Overview

**Megara** was a Theban princess, daughter of Creon, and the first wife of [Heracles](heracles.md). She bore him several children, all of whom Heracles killed in a fit of madness sent by [Hera](../deities/hera.md). Her death at Heracles' hands is one of the defining tragedies of his story.

## In the Bibliotheca

[Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) records that after Heracles defeated Erginus and the Minyans, "Creon gave him his elder daughter Megara." When Heracles was later driven mad by Hera, "he flung his own children whom he had by Megara and two children of Iphicles into the fire." In some versions, he subsequently "gave Megara to Iolaus."[^apd-megara]

[^apd-megara]: "Creon gave him his elder daughter Megara... he flung his own children whom he had by Megara and two children of Iphicles into the fire" (Bibliotheca 2.4.11-2.4.12, trans. J.G. Frazer)

## In the Fabulae

[Hyginus](../sources/hyginus.md) names Megara's children as Therimachus and Ophites. He records that Lycus, son of [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md), tried to kill Megara and the children, but Heracles killed Lycus first. Then "Juno sent madness upon him, and he killed Megara and his sons Therimachus and Ophites."[^hyg-megara]

[^hyg-megara]: "Lycus, son of Neptune, tried to kill Megara, daughter of Creon, and her sons Therimachus and Ophites, and Amphitryon, in order to seize the kingdom. Hercules killed Lycus. After this Juno sent madness upon him, and he killed Megara and his sons Therimachus and Ophites" (Fabulae §32, trans. Mary Grant)

## In Euripides' Heracles

In the [Heracles](../sources/euripides-heracles.md), Megara appears as a dignified and courageous figure facing death. With [Heracles](heracles.md) absent in [Hades](../deities/hades.md), the usurper Lycus threatens to kill her, the children, and [Amphitryon](amphitryon.md). Megara accepts her fate with nobility, preferring a dignified death to prolonged suffering: she proposes that they dress the children in burial garments and go to death willingly rather than beg.[^eur-her-meg-death]

When Heracles returns and kills Lycus, the family celebrates — but then [Hera](../deities/hera.md) sends madness upon Heracles. In his frenzy, as he imagined himself attacking [Eurystheus](eurystheus.md), he killed his sons one by one. Megara died shielding their last child: "the bolt impelled through both, laid dead at once the mother and the child."[^eur-her-meg-killed]

[^eur-her-meg-death]: Heracles ~280-311, trans. Michael Wodhull
[^eur-her-meg-killed]: "the bolt impelled through both, laid dead at once the mother and the child" (Heracles ~1000, trans. Michael Wodhull)
