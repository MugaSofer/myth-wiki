## Overview

**Leda** was the wife of [Tyndareus](tyndareus.md), king of Sparta, and by his marriage to her became mother of the Dioscuri and [Helen](helen.md). According to multiple sources, [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) consorted with her in the form of a swan on the same night that [Tyndareus](tyndareus.md) lay with her, resulting in the birth of divine and mortal children.

## In Apollodorus

### Marriage to Tyndareus

When [Tyndareus](tyndareus.md) was expelled from Lacedaemon by his brother [Hippocoon](hippocoon.md), he fled to [Thestius](thestius.md), king of Aetolia. There he married Leda, daughter of [Thestius](thestius.md): "They fled to Thestius and allied themselves with him in the war which he waged with his neighbors; and Tyndareus married Leda, daughter of Thestius."[^apd-marriage] Later, when [Heracles](heracles.md) slew [Hippocoon](hippocoon.md) and his sons, [Tyndareus](tyndareus.md) returned to his kingdom.[^apd-return]

[^apd-marriage]: "They fled to Thestius and allied themselves with him in the war which he waged with his neighbors; and Tyndareus married Leda, daughter of Thestius" (Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 3.10.5, trans. J.G. Frazer)

[^apd-return]: "But afterwards, when Hercules slew Hippocoon and his sons, they returned, and Tyndareus succeeded to the kingdom" (Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 3.10.5, trans. J.G. Frazer)

### Her Children

[Tyndareus](tyndareus.md) and Leda had several daughters: "Tyndareus and Leda had daughters, to wit, Timandra, whom Echemus married, and Clytaemnestra, whom Agamemnon married; also another daughter Phylonoe, whom Artemis made immortal."[^apd-daughters]

[^apd-daughters]: "Tyndareus and Leda had daughters, to wit, Timandra, whom Echemus married, and Clytaemnestra, whom Agamemnon married; also another daughter Phylonoe, whom Artemis made immortal" (Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 3.10.6, trans. J.G. Frazer)

### Zeus' Seduction

According to [Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md), [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) visited Leda in the form of a swan. "Zeus in the form of a swan consorted with Leda, and on the same night Tyndareus cohabited with her; and she bore Pollux and Helen to Zeus, and Castor and Clytaemnestra to Tyndareus."[^apd-swan]

[^apd-swan]: "But Zeus in the form of a swan consorted with Leda, and on the same night Tyndareus cohabited with her; and she bore Pollux and Helen to Zeus, and Castor and Clytaemnestra to Tyndareus" (Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 3.10.7, trans. J.G. Frazer)

### Variant Account of Helen's Parentage

[Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) notes an alternative tradition regarding [Helen](helen.md)'s parentage: "But some say that Helen was a daughter of Nemesis and Zeus; for that she, flying from the arms of Zeus, changed herself into a goose, but Zeus in his turn took the likeness of a swan and so enjoyed her; and as the fruit of their loves she laid an egg, and a certain shepherd found it in the groves and brought and gave it to Leda; and she put it in a chest and kept it; and when Helen was hatched in due time, Leda brought her up as her own daughter."[^apd-nemesis]

[^apd-nemesis]: "But some say that Helen was a daughter of Nemesis and Zeus; for that she, flying from the arms of Zeus, changed herself into a goose, but Zeus in his turn took the likeness of a swan and so enjoyed her; and as the fruit of their loves she laid an egg, and a certain shepherd found it in the groves and brought and gave it to Leda; and she put it in a chest and kept it; and when Helen was hatched in due time, Leda brought her up as her own daughter" (Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 3.10.7, trans. J.G. Frazer)

## In Hesiod's Fragments

In a hymn to the Dioscuri, Hesiod describes Leda as "neat-ankled" and places her beneath Mount Taygetus: "Beneath the heights of Taygetus stately Leda bare them, when the dark-clouded Son of Cronos had privily bent her to his will."[^hesiod-taygetus]

[^hesiod-taygetus]: "Beneath the heights of Taygetus stately Leda bare them, when the dark-clouded Son of Cronos had privily bent her to his will" (Hesiod, Hymn to the Dioscuri, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

The Homeric Hymn to the Dioscuri similarly describes the Dioscuri as "glorious children of neat-ankled Leda" and recounts: "When Leda had lain with the dark-clouded Son of Cronos, she bare them beneath the peak of the great hill Taygetus."[^hesiod-dioscuri]

[^hesiod-dioscuri]: "Bright-eyed Muses, tell of the Tyndaridae, the Sons of Zeus, glorious children of neat-ankled Leda, Castor the tamer of horses, and blameless Polydeuces. When Leda had lain with the dark-clouded Son of Cronos, she bare them beneath the peak of the great hill Taygetus" (Hesiod, Homeric Hymn XXXIII to the Dioscuri, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Variant Traditions

The sources differ on [Helen](helen.md)'s paternity. [Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) reports the more common account—that [Helen](helen.md) was born to Leda and [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md)—but also preserves an alternative tradition that [Helen](helen.md) was the daughter of [Nemesis](../deities/nemesis.md) and [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md), with Leda serving as her foster-mother after discovering the egg in which [Helen](helen.md) hatched.

A fragment attributed to Hesiod presents yet another version: "Hesiod, however, makes Helen the child neither of Leda nor Nemesis, but daughter of Ocean and Zeus."[^hesiod-helen]

[^hesiod-helen]: "Hesiod, however, makes Helen the child neither of Leda nor Nemesis, but daughter of Ocean and Zeus" (Hesiod Fragments, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
