## Overview

**Ceyx** and **Alcyone** (Halcyone) are a devoted royal couple whose separation by sea, shipwreck, and grief result in their joint transformation into halcyon birds (kingfishers). Their story in the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md) contains Ovid's most elaborate storm scene and his vivid description of the Cave of Sleep.

## In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md)

### Peleus at Trachis (11.266-409)

Ceyx first appears hosting [Peleus](peleus.md), who has come to Trachis after killing his half-brother Phocus. Ceyx tells the story of his brother Daedalion, transformed into a hawk by [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) after leaping from a cliff in grief over his daughter Chione (killed by [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md) for boasting she surpassed the goddess in beauty).[^met-ceyx-daedalion]

When a monstrous wolf sent by the sea-nymph Psamathe attacks Peleus's cattle, Ceyx arms to help, but [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md) intercedes and the wolf is turned to marble.[^met-ceyx-wolf]

### The Voyage and Alcyone's Farewell (11.410-473)

Disturbed by prodigies, Ceyx resolved to consult the oracle at Claros. Alcyone begged him not to go by sea: "The sea affrights me with its tragic face." She pleaded to go with him: "if this new resolve can not be altered by my prayers and fears, and if you are determined, take me, too: some comfort may be gained, if in the storms we may be tossed together."[^met-ceyx-plea]

Ceyx promised to return "before the moon has rounded twice her orb." Alcyone saw him off from shore, "she followed with her gaze the fading hull; and, when that too was lost far in the distance, she remained and gazed at the white topsails, waving from the mast."[^met-ceyx-farewell]

### The Shipwreck (11.474-572)

The storm is described at great length. "The sea grew white with its increasing waves, while boisterous east winds blew with violence." The captain lost control: "he did not know the status of the ship, and could not order nor forbid the men — so great the storm, so far beyond his skill."[^met-ceyx-storm]

As the ship broke apart, Ceyx "clung to a fragment of the wreck with that majestic hand which often before had proudly swayed the sceptre." While swimming he called "Halcyone — far off, as often as the billows would allow his lips to open, and among the waves his darling's name was murmured, till at last a night-black arch of water swept above the highest waves and buried him."[^met-ceyx-drown]

### The Cave of Sleep (11.573-649)

Meanwhile Alcyone prayed to [Hera](../deities/hera.md) for Ceyx's safe return. Hera, unable to accept prayers for one already dead, sent Iris to the Cave of Sleep: "Near the Cimmerian Land there is a cave... the home of slothful Sleep. To that dark cave the Sun, when rising or in middle skies, or setting, never can approach with light." Before the doors bloom "most fertile poppies and a wealth of herbs," and from a rock trickle Lethean waters. Within, the god of sleep lies on an ebony couch surrounded by unsubstantial dreams "as many as the uncounted ears of corn at harvest."[^met-ceyx-sleep]

Sleep sent his son Morpheus, who "flew through the night of darkness, on his wings that make no sound." Taking Ceyx's drowned form, Morpheus appeared to Alcyone: "Most wretched wife, can you still recognize your own loved Ceyx, or have my looks changed so much with death you can not? — Look at me."[^met-ceyx-morpheus]

### Transformation (11.710-748)

At dawn Alcyone went to the shore and saw a body floating on the water. As it drifted closer she recognized Ceyx. She leaped onto a man-made mole and "while beating the light air with wings that instant formed upon her, she flew on, a mourning bird, and skimmed above the waves." She embraced his body with her new wings and "gave cold kisses with her hardened bill."[^met-ceyx-transform]

Through the pity of the gods, both were changed to birds. "Their love lived on, nor in these birds were marriage bonds dissolved." Each winter Alcyone broods on her floating nest during "seven full days of calm" — "the passage of the deep is free from storms, throughout those seven full days; and Aeolus restraining harmful winds, within their cave, for his descendants' sake gives halcyon seas."[^met-ceyx-halcyon]

[^met-ceyx-daedalion]: "Apollo pitied him.—And when Daedalion leaped over the steep cliff, Apollo's power transformed him to a bird" (Metamorphoses 11.337-342, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-ceyx-wolf]: "Thetis, interceding on behalf of her afflicted husband, moved her will" (Metamorphoses 11.397-400, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-ceyx-plea]: "if this new resolve can not be altered by my prayers and fears, and if you are determined, take me, too: some comfort may be gained, if in the storms we may be tossed together. I shall fear only the ills that really come to us" (Metamorphoses 11.438-443, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-ceyx-farewell]: "she followed with her gaze the fading hull; and, when that too was lost far in the distance, she remained and gazed at the white topsails, waving from the mast. But, when she could no longer see the sails, with anxious heart she sought her lonely couch" (Metamorphoses 11.473-481, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-ceyx-storm]: "he did not know the status of the ship, and could not order nor forbid the men — so great the storm, so far beyond his skill" (Metamorphoses 11.504-506, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-ceyx-drown]: "Swimming, he called Halcyone — far off, as often as the billows would allow his lips to open, and among the waves his darling's name was murmured, till at last a night-black arch of water swept above the highest waves and buried him beneath engulfing billows" (Metamorphoses 11.540-546, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-ceyx-sleep]: "Near the Cimmerian Land there is a cave, with a long entrance, in a hallowed mountain, the home of slothful Sleep. To that dark cave the Sun, when rising or in middle skies, or setting, never can approach with light" (Metamorphoses 11.592-596, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-ceyx-morpheus]: "Most wretched wife, can you still recognize your own loved Ceyx, or have my looks changed so much with death you can not? — Look at me" (Metamorphoses 11.653-656, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-ceyx-transform]: "while beating the light air with wings that instant formed upon her, she flew on, a mourning bird, and skimmed above the waves... embracing his dear limbs with her new wings, she gave cold kisses with her hardened bill" (Metamorphoses 11.729-737, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-ceyx-halcyon]: "Their love lived on, nor in these birds were marriage bonds dissolved... Each winter during seven full days of calm Halcyone broods on her floating nest — her nest that sails upon a halcyon sea" (Metamorphoses 11.743-750, trans. Brookes More)
