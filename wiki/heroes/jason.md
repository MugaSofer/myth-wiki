## Overview

**Jason** is the son of Aeson and Polymede, a hero who led the Argonauts to Colchis to retrieve the Golden Fleece. His story is told at length in the [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) (1.9.16-1.9.28).

## In the [Argonautica](../sources/argonautica.md)

### Background and the Quest

In Apollonius's telling, Pelias received an oracle "to beware of the man with a single sandal" and Jason "in crossing the river Anaurus" lost a sandal in the flood.[^arg1-sandal] He is the son of Aeson, who is grandson of Cretheus, making him kin to the sons of Phrixus through the brotherhood of Cretheus and Athamas.[^arg2-kin]

[^arg1-sandal]: The poem opens with Pelias's oracle about one sandal and Jason crossing the Anaurus (Argonautica 1.1-5, trans. R.C. Seaton)
[^arg2-kin]: "Cretheus and Athamas were brothers. I am the grandson of Cretheus" (Argonautica 2.1170-1171)

### Appearance

Jason was repeatedly compared to the gods in beauty. At departure, he shone "like [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md)" and his comrades wondered at him "radiant with manifold graces."[^arg3-beauty] When [Hera](../deities/hera.md) enhanced his appearance before the meeting with [Medea](medea.md), "Never yet had there been such a man in the days of old, neither of all the heroes of the lineage of Zeus himself... as on that day the bride of Zeus made Jason, both to look upon and to hold converse with."[^arg3-hera-beauty] Medea saw him approaching "like Sirius coming from ocean, which rises fair and clear to see, but brings unspeakable mischief to flocks."[^arg3-sirius]

[^arg3-beauty]: "Even his comrades wondered as they gazed upon him, radiant with manifold graces" (Argonautica 3.924)
[^arg3-hera-beauty]: "Never yet had there been such a man in the days of old, neither of all the heroes of the lineage of Zeus himself, nor of those who sprung from the blood of the other gods, as on that day the bride of Zeus made Jason, both to look upon and to hold converse with" (Argonautica 3.919-923)
[^arg3-sirius]: "like Sirius coming from ocean, which rises fair and clear to see, but brings unspeakable mischief to flocks; thus then did Aeson's son come to her, fair to see, but the sight of him brought love-sick care" (Argonautica 3.960-962)

### Leadership and Character

Apollonius portrays Jason not as a conventional warrior-hero but as a leader burdened by constant anxiety. After passing the Symplegades, Jason confessed: "I have erred and am distraught in wretched and helpless ruin... ever when day is done I pass a night of groans from the time when ye first gathered together for my sake, while I take thought for all things."[^arg2-despair] When his comrades shouted encouragement, "his heart was warmed within him at their cry" and his courage returned.[^arg2-rallied]

After the deaths of Idmon and Tiphys, Jason was again despairing: "where are these steersmen of thine?... I forebode an evil doom for us even as for the dead."[^arg2-gloom] Yet he always recovered when urged by his companions. He emphasised persuasion over force, preferring to approach Aeetes with words: "Oftentimes, I ween, does speech accomplish at need what prowess could hardly carry through."[^arg3-speech]

[^arg2-despair]: "I have erred and am distraught in wretched and helpless ruin... ever when day is done I pass a night of groans from the time when ye first gathered together for my sake, while I take thought for all things" (Argonautica 2.621-634)
[^arg2-rallied]: "his heart was warmed within him at their cry and again he spake outright among them" (Argonautica 2.638-639)
[^arg2-gloom]: "where are these steersmen of thine? For those whom we once deemed to be men of skill, they even more than I are bowed with vexation of heart" (Argonautica 2.888-890)
[^arg3-speech]: "Oftentimes, I ween, does speech accomplish at need what prowess could hardly carry through, smoothing the path in manner befitting" (Argonautica 3.190-191)

### Hera's Patronage

[Hera](../deities/hera.md) explained her devotion to Jason: "at the mouth of Anaurus in flood, as I was making trial of men's righteousness, he met me on his return from the chase... And he took pity on me in the likeness of an old crone, and raising me on his shoulders himself bore me through the headlong tide."[^arg3-hera] She actively intervened throughout: conspiring with [Athena](../deities/athena.md) and [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md) to send [Eros](../deities/eros.md) against Medea, spreading mist to conceal the heroes, enhancing Jason's beauty, and directing the return voyage.

[^arg3-hera]: "at the mouth of Anaurus in flood, as I was making trial of men's righteousness, he met me on his return from the chase... And he took pity on me in the likeness of an old crone, and raising me on his shoulders himself bore me through the headlong tide" (Argonautica 3.69-76)

### At Colchis

When Aeetes set his challenge, Jason "fixing his eyes on the ground, sat just as he was, speechless, helpless in his evil plight" and could not take on the task with courage.[^arg3-helpless] He accepted nonetheless: "fate and the ruthless command of a presumptuous king urged me."[^arg3-accept] Medea gave him the charm of Prometheus — a plant sprung from the ichor of Prometheus's wound — and instructions for a midnight sacrifice to [Hecate](../deities/hecate.md).

Jason performed the rite: he "bathed his tender body reverently in the sacred river" and called on Hecate Brimo, who came "from the uttermost depths" with serpents, torches, and "the hounds of hell."[^arg3-hecate] The charm made him invulnerable — his comrades' weapons could not bend his spear, and Idas's sword "leapt back repelled by the shock, like a hammer from the anvil."[^arg3-invulnerable]

He yoked the fire-breathing bronze-footed bulls, ploughed four plough-gates, sowed the dragon's teeth, and threw a massive stone among the rising warriors so they fought each other. He then mowed down the survivors "as a fiery star leaps from heaven, trailing a furrow of light."[^arg3-trial]

[^arg3-helpless]: "Jason, fixing his eyes on the ground, sat just as he was, speechless, helpless in his evil plight. For a long time he turned the matter this way and that, and could in no way take on him the task with courage" (Argonautica 3.417-421)
[^arg3-accept]: "fate and the ruthless command of a presumptuous king urged me" (Argonautica 3.427)
[^arg3-hecate]: "she heard him, the dread goddess, from the uttermost depths and came to the sacrifice of Aeson's son; and round her horrible serpents twined themselves among the oak boughs; and there was a gleam of countless torches; and sharply howled around her the hounds of hell" (Argonautica 3.1212-1218)
[^arg3-invulnerable]: "the edge leapt back repelled by the shock, like a hammer from the anvil; and the heroes shouted with joy for their hope in the contest" (Argonautica 3.1252-1253)
[^arg3-trial]: "even as a fiery star leaps from heaven, trailing a furrow of light, a portent to men... in such wise did Aeson's son rush upon the earthborn men" (Argonautica 3.1374-1378)

### Winning the Fleece

Medea sang the guardian serpent to sleep and sprinkled its eyes with a juniper charm. "Hereupon Jason snatched the golden fleece from the oak, at the maiden bidding."[^arg4-snatch] The fleece was immense: "great as is the hide of a yearling ox... all golden above. Heavy it was, thickly clustered with flocks; and as he moved along, even beneath his feet the sheen rose up from the earth."[^arg4-fleece-desc]

[^arg4-snatch]: "Hereupon Jason snatched the golden fleece from the oak, at the maiden bidding" (Argonautica 4.162)
[^arg4-fleece-desc]: "great as is the hide of a yearling ox or stag... so great in extent was the fleece all golden above. Heavy it was, thickly clustered with flocks; and as he moved along, even beneath his feet the sheen rose up from the earth" (Argonautica 4.171-176)

### The Murder of Apsyrtus

Jason swore to Medea: "Let Zeus of Olympus himself be witness to my oath, and Hera, queen of marriage, bride of Zeus, that I will set thee in my halls my own wedded wife."[^arg4-oath] When trapped by the Colchian fleet, Medea proposed luring Apsyrtus. Jason ambushed him at a temple of [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md) and "struck him down, as a butcher strikes down a mighty strong-horned bull."[^arg4-murder] He then performed a ritual of purification: "thrice licked up some blood and thrice spat the pollution from his teeth, as it is right for the slayer to do, to atone for a treacherous murder."[^arg4-rite]

[^arg4-oath]: "Let Zeus of Olympus himself be witness to my oath, and Hera, queen of marriage, bride of Zeus, that I will set thee in my halls my own wedded wife, when we have reached the land of Hellas on our return" (Argonautica 4.99-103)
[^arg4-murder]: "Jason marked him and struck him down, as a butcher strikes down a mighty strong-horned bull, hard by the temple which the Brygi on the mainland opposite had once built for Artemis" (Argonautica 4.467-470)
[^arg4-rite]: "thrice licked up some blood and thrice spat the pollution from his teeth, as it is right for the slayer to do, to atone for a treacherous murder" (Argonautica 4.477-479)

### The Return

[Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) ordained purification, and the Argo's Dodonian beam spoke, directing them to [Circe](../deities/circe.md). They sailed through the Eridanus, the Rhodanus, past the Stoechades, to Aeaea. Circe purified them but condemned their deed. They passed the [Sirens](../creatures/sirens.md) (Orpheus sang over them), the Wandering Rocks ([Thetis](../deities/thetis.md) and the Nereids guided the ship through), and reached Phaeacia. King Alcinous judged that if Medea was still a maid she must return to her father, but if married, she stayed with Jason. Arete warned Jason through a herald; they married that night in the sacred cave of Macris. At Crete, Medea bewitched and destroyed the bronze giant Talos. After darkness at sea, [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) appeared and revealed the isle of Anaphe. They returned home to Pagasae.

## In the Bibliotheca

### The Oracle and the Single Sandal

Jason dwelt in Iolcus, where Pelias was king. Pelias "consulted the oracle concerning the kingdom" and "the god warned him to beware of the man with a single sandal."[^apd-oracle] When Pelias held a sacrifice to [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md), Jason hastened to attend, "and in crossing the river Anaurus he lost a sandal in the stream and landed with only one."[^apd-sandal]

Pelias asked Jason what he would do if he received an oracle that he should be murdered by a citizen. Jason answered — "whether at haphazard or instigated by the angry [Hera](../deities/hera.md) in order that [Medea](medea.md) should prove a curse to Pelias, who did not honor Hera" — that he would command the man to bring the Golden Fleece.[^apd-answer]

[^apd-oracle]: "when Pelias consulted the oracle concerning the kingdom, the god warned him to beware of the man with a single sandal" (Bibliotheca 1.9.16, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-sandal]: "in crossing the river Anaurus he lost a sandal in the stream and landed with only one" (Bibliotheca 1.9.16, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-answer]: "Jason answered, whether at haphazard or instigated by the angry Hera in order that Medea should prove a curse to Pelias, who did not honor Hera, 'I would command him,' said he, 'to bring the Golden Fleece'" (Bibliotheca 1.9.16, trans. Frazer)

### Building the Argo

Jason "called in the help of Argus, son of Phrixus; and Argus, by [Athena](../deities/athena.md)'s advice, built a ship of fifty oars named Argo after its builder; and at the prow Athena fitted in a speaking timber from the oak of Dodona."[^apd-argo]

[^apd-argo]: "Argus, by Athena's advice, built a ship of fifty oars named Argo after its builder; and at the prow Athena fitted in a speaking timber from the oak of Dodona" (Bibliotheca 1.9.16, trans. Frazer)

### The Voyage

The Argonauts' journey included many episodes:

- **Lemnos** (1.9.17): The Argonauts landed at Lemnos, bereft of men after the women killed their fathers and husbands (caused by [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md)'s curse). Jason bedded with Hypsipyle and bore sons Euneus and Nebrophonus.
- **Doliones** (1.9.18): Received kindly by King Cyzicus, but on departing by night they were driven back and fought the Doliones in mutual ignorance, slaying Cyzicus.
- **Mysia** (1.9.19): [Heracles](heracles.md) was left behind while searching for Hylas, who was "ravished away by nymphs on account of his beauty."[^apd-hylas]
- **Bebryces** (1.9.20): King Amycus, son of [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md), forced strangers to box. Pollux killed him with a blow on the elbow.
- **Phineus and the Harpies** (1.9.21): Phineus, a blind seer, was tormented by the [Harpies](../creatures/harpies.md). Zetes and Calais chased them away, and Phineus advised the Argonauts about the Clashing Rocks.
- **Clashing Rocks** (1.9.22): They sent a dove ahead; it passed safely (losing only the tip of its tail), and "with hard rowing and the help of [Hera](../deities/hera.md), they passed through."[^apd-clashing]
- **Colchis** (1.9.23): Jason was challenged to yoke brazen-footed fire-breathing bulls (gifts of [Hephaestus](../deities/hephaestus.md)) and sow dragon's teeth. [Medea](medea.md), "a witch, daughter of Aeetes," gave him a drug that made him immune to fire and iron for a single day.[^apd-medea-drug]

[^apd-hylas]: "Hylas, son of Thiodamas, a minion of Hercules, had been sent to draw water and was ravished away by nymphs on account of his beauty" (Bibliotheca 1.9.19, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-clashing]: "with hard rowing and the help of Hera, they passed through, the extremity of the ship's ornamented poop being shorn away right round" (Bibliotheca 1.9.22, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-medea-drug]: "she gave him a drug with which she bade him anoint his shield, spear, and body when he was about to yoke the bulls; for she said that, anointed with it, he could for a single day be harmed neither by fire nor by iron" (Bibliotheca 1.9.23, trans. Frazer)

### Winning the Fleece

Jason yoked the bulls, sowed the dragon's teeth, and slew the armed men that sprang from the ground. But Aeetes would not give the fleece and planned to burn the Argo. [Medea](medea.md) "brought Jason by night to the fleece, and having lulled to sleep by her drugs the dragon that guarded it, she possessed herself of the fleece and in Jason's company came to the Argo."[^apd-fleece]

[^apd-fleece]: "Medea brought Jason by night to the fleece, and having lulled to sleep by her drugs the dragon that guarded it, she possessed herself of the fleece and in Jason's company came to the Argo" (Bibliotheca 1.9.23, trans. Frazer)

### The Return

On the return voyage, [Medea](medea.md) murdered her brother Apsyrtus to delay Aeetes' pursuit. [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) sent a storm in anger, and the Argo spoke, saying they must be purified by [Circe](../deities/circe.md). They were purified at Aeaea, then passed the [Sirens](../creatures/sirens.md) (countered by Orpheus), [Scylla](../creatures/scylla.md) and the Wandering Rocks (steered through by [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md) and the Nereids at [Hera](../deities/hera.md)'s summons), and Crete (where Talos was defeated by Medea's wiles). They reached Iolcus "having completed the whole voyage in four months."[^apd-return]

[^apd-return]: "they sailed betwixt Euboea and Locris and came to Iolcus, having completed the whole voyage in four months" (Bibliotheca 1.9.26, trans. Frazer)

### After the Quest

Jason "surrendered the fleece, but though he longed to avenge his wrongs he bided his time." His father Aeson had been forced to suicide, his mother had hanged herself, and Pelias had slain her infant son. Jason "exhorted Medea to devise how he could punish Pelias." Medea persuaded Pelias's daughters to cut up their father and boil him, promising to make him young again — "she cut up a ram and made it into a lamb by boiling it. So they believed her, made mince meat of their father and boiled him."[^apd-pelias]

Acastus buried his father and expelled Jason and Medea from Iolcus. They went to Corinth, "and lived there happily for ten years." Then Jason married Glauce, daughter of King Creon, and divorced Medea. She killed the bride and Creon with a poisoned robe, slew her own children Mermerus and Pheres, and "having got from the Sun a car drawn by winged dragons she fled on it to Athens."[^apd-corinth]

[^apd-pelias]: "she repaired to the palace of Pelias and persuaded his daughters to make mince meat of their father and boil him, promising to make him young again by her drugs; and to win their confidence she cut up a ram and made it into a lamb by boiling it. So they believed her, made mince meat of their father and boiled him" (Bibliotheca 1.9.27, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-corinth]: "she sent the bride a robe steeped in poison, which when Glauce had put on, she was consumed with fierce fire along with her father, who went to her rescue. But Mermerus and Pheres, the children whom Medea had by Jason, she killed" (Bibliotheca 1.9.28, trans. Frazer)

## In the Odyssey

[Hera](../deities/hera.md) is said to have sent the Argo past the Wandering Rocks "for love of Jason."[^od12-argo]

[^od12-argo]: "One ship only of all that fare by sea hath passed that way, even Argo, that is in all men's minds, on her voyage from Aeetes. And even her the wave would lightly have cast there upon the mighty rocks, but Here sent her by for love of Jason." (Odyssey 12.72-75, trans. Butcher and Lang)

## In the Catalogue of Women

The Catalogue confirms Jason's parentage and adds his upbringing by [Chiron](../creatures/chiron.md): "Aeson, who begot a son Iason, shepherd of the people, whom Chiron brought up in woody Pelion."[^cat-jason]

[^cat-jason]: "Aeson, who begot a son Iason, shepherd of the people, whom Chiron brought up in woody Pelion" (Catalogue of Women, Fragment 13, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## In the Fabulae

### Pelias and the Oracle (§12)

Hyginus gives an oracle to Pelias different from the Bibliotheca's version: "An oracle bade Pelias, son of Cretheus and Tyro, sacrifice to [Neptune](../deities/poseidon.md), and told him his death was drawing near if a monocrepis, that is, a man wearing only one sandal, arrived."[^hyg12-oracle]

Jason arrived at the sacrifice having lost one sandal crossing "the river Evenus" (not Anaurus as in the Bibliotheca), and Pelias, "remembering the warning of the oracle, he bade him procure from King Aeetes, his enemy, the Golden Fleece of the ram which Phrixus had dedicated to Mars at Colchis."[^hyg12-task]

[^hyg12-oracle]: "An oracle bade Pelias, son of Cretheus and Tyro, sacrifice to Neptune, and told him his death was drawing near if a monocrepis, that is, a man wearing only one sandal, arrived" (Fabulae §12, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg12-task]: "When Pelias noticed this, remembering the warning of the oracle, he bade him procure from King Aeetes, his enemy, the Golden Fleece of the ram which Phrixus had dedicated to Mars at Colchis" (Fabulae §12, trans. Mary Grant)

### Juno at the River (§13)

The Fabulae preserves a fuller account of [Hera](../deities/hera.md)'s involvement: "When [Juno](../deities/hera.md), near the river Evenus, had changed her form to that of an old woman, and was waiting to test men's minds to see if they would carry her across the river Evenus, no one offered till Jason, son of Aeson and Alcimede, took her across."[^hyg13-juno] Her favor toward Jason was earned through this act of kindness, and "angry at Pelias for failing to sacrifice to her, she caused Jason to leave one sandal in the mud."[^hyg13-sandal]

[^hyg13-juno]: "When Juno, near the river Evenus, had changed her form to that of an old woman, and was waiting to test men's minds to see if they would carry her across the river Evenus, no one offered till Jason, son of Aeson and Alcimede, took her across" (Fabulae §13, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg13-sandal]: "But, angry at Pelias for failing to sacrifice to her, she caused Jason to leave one sandal in the mud" (Fabulae §13, trans. Mary Grant)

### The Argonauts Assembled (§14-14.5)

The Fabulae provides an extensive catalog of the Argonauts with genealogies and home cities. Jason is listed as "Jason, son of Aeson and Alcimede, Clymene's daughter, leader of the Thessalians."[^hyg14-jason] The list includes detailed information about each hero, their parentage, and their cities of origin, totaling "all these were called Minyae, either because daughters of Minyas bore most of them, or because Jason's mother was a daughter of Clymene, daughter of Minyas."[^hyg14-minyae]

The Fabulae also records the positions on the ship: "Jason, therefore, directed them. Argus, son of Danaus, was shipbuilder; Tiphys was pilot. After his death Ancaeus, son of Neptune, steered. Lynceus, son of Aphareus, who had keen sight, was the lookout man at the prow."[^hyg14-5-positions]

[^hyg14-jason]: "Jason, son of Aeson and Alcimede, Clymene's daughter, leader of the Thessalians" (Fabulae §14, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg14-minyae]: "Moreover, all these were called Minyae, either because daughters of Minyas bore most of them, or because Jason's mother was a daughter of Clymene, daughter of Minyas" (Fabulae §14.4, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg14-5-positions]: "Jason, therefore, directed them. Argus, son of Danaus, was shipbuilder; Tiphys was pilot. After his death Ancaeus, son of Neptune, steered. Lynceus, son of Aphareus, who had keen sight, was the lookout man at the prow" (Fabulae §14.5, trans. Mary Grant)

### Aeetes' Tasks (§22)

In Hyginus's account, Aeetes sets the tasks because "An oracle told Aeetes, son of [Sol](../deities/helius.md), that he would keep his kingdom as long as the fleece which Phrixus had dedicated should remain in the shrine of Mars."[^hyg22-oracle] The tasks are similar to other accounts: "to yoke with yoke of adamant the bronze-footed bulls which breathed flames from their nostrils, and plow, and sow from a helmet the dragon's teeth, from which a tribe of armed men should arise and slay each other."[^hyg22-tasks]

[Juno](../deities/hera.md)'s involvement is explained through Jason's earlier kindness: "Juno, however, wished to save Jason, because once when she had come to a river and wished to test the minds of men, she assumed an old woman's form, and asked to be carried across. He had carried her across when others who had passed over despised her."[^hyg22-juno] She arranged for [Venus](../deities/aphrodite.md) to inspire [Medea](medea.md) with love, "and so since she knew that Jason could not perform the commands without help of Medea, she asked Venus to inspire Medea with love."[^hyg22-venus]

[^hyg22-oracle]: "An oracle told Aeetes, son of Sol, that he would keep his kingdom as long as the fleece which Phrixus had dedicated should remain in the shrine of Mars" (Fabulae §22, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg22-tasks]: "to yoke with yoke of adamant the bronze-footed bulls which breathed flames from their nostrils, and plow, and sow from a helmet the dragon's teeth, from which a tribe of armed men should arise and slay each other" (Fabulae §22, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg22-juno]: "Juno, however, wished to save Jason, because once when she had come to a river and wished to test the minds of men, she assumed an old woman's form, and asked to be carried across. He had carried her across when others who had passed over despised her" (Fabulae §22, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg22-venus]: "And so since she knew that Jason could not perform the commands without help of Medea, she asked Venus to inspire Medea with love. At Venus' instigation, Jason was loved by Medea" (Fabulae §22, trans. Mary Grant)

### The Daughters of Pelias (§24)

After the quest, Jason's revenge on Pelias is described in detail. [Medea](medea.md) disguised herself "in the guise of a priestess of [Diana](../deities/artemis.md)" and promised to make Pelias young again.[^hyg24-disguise] When Pelias's eldest daughter Alcestis doubted, "Medea cast mist before them, and by means of drugs formed many strange things which seemed to be like reality, putting an old ram in a brazen vessel, from which a very fine young lamb seemed to spring."[^hyg24-ram]

Convinced by this demonstration, "the daughters of Pelias — namely, Alcestis, Pelopia, Medusa, Pisidice, and Hippothoe — at Medea's instigation slew their father and cooked him in a brazen caldron."[^hyg24-murder] After they realized the deception, "Jason, at a given signal of Medea, made himself the master of the palace, and handed over the rule to Acastus, son of Pelias, brother of the Peliades, because he had gone with him to Colchis."[^hyg24-acastus]

[^hyg24-disguise]: "And so, when they were now far from Colchis, she bade the ship be hidden in a secret place, and she herself in the guise of a priestess of Diana came to the daughters of Pelias" (Fabulae §24, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg24-ram]: "In order more easily to bend her to her will, Medea cast mist before them, and by means of drugs formed many strange things which seemed to be like reality, putting an old ram in a brazen vessel, from which a very fine young lamb seemed to spring" (Fabulae §24, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg24-murder]: "So in the same way the daughters of Pelias — namely, Alcestis, Pelopia, Medusa, Pisidice, and Hippothoe — at Medea's instigation slew their father and cooked him in a brazen caldron" (Fabulae §24, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg24-acastus]: "But Jason, at a given signal of Medea, made himself the master of the palace, and handed over the rule to Acastus, son of Pelias, brother of the Peliades, because he had gone with him to Colchis. He himself with Medea departed for Corinth" (Fabulae §24, trans. Mary Grant)

## In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md)

### Jason and Medea at Colchis (7.1-158)

Ovid tells the Colchis episode entirely through [Medea](medea.md)'s perspective, with Jason as the object of her passion rather than the active hero. When Jason arrives at Aeetes' court to demand the Golden Fleece, Medea is consumed with love at the sight of him: "she saw the son of Aeson, dying flames leaped up again... so now her love that had been smoldering, and which you would have thought was almost dead, when she had see again his manly youth, blazed up once more."[^met-jason-1]

Jason speaks to Medea and promises marriage, "grasping her right hand," and she gives him the magic herbs to protect him against the fire-breathing bulls.[^met-jason-2] On the Field of [Ares](../deities/ares.md), Jason tames the brazen-footed bulls and sows dragon's teeth. When earth-born warriors rise to attack him, he hurls a stone into their midst so that "those earth-born brothers fought among themselves till all were slaughtered in blood-thirsty strife."[^met-jason-3] He then lulls the dragon guarding the [Golden Fleece](../objects/golden-fleece.md) with Lethean herbs, and "proudly sailed away bearing his treasure and the willing maid."[^met-jason-4]

### Rejuvenation of Aeson (7.159-293)

After the return to Iolcus, Jason grieves that his father Aeson is worn out with age. He begs Medea: "take from my life some years that I should live and add them to my father's ending days."[^met-jason-5] Medea refuses to shorten Jason's life but promises a greater feat, and through elaborate ritual magic restores Aeson to the vigor of youth.

[^met-jason-1]: "she saw the son of Aeson, dying flames leaped up again... so now her love that had been smoldering, and which you would have thought was almost dead, when she had see again his manly youth, blazed up once more" (Metamorphoses 7.77-84, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-jason-2]: "he spoke to her, and promised marriage, grasping her right hand... He swore that she could trust in him" (Metamorphoses 7.86-93, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-jason-3]: "those earth-born brothers fought among themselves till all were slaughtered in blood-thirsty strife" (Metamorphoses 7.140-141, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-jason-4]: "proudly sailed away bearing his treasure and the willing maid, (whose aid had saved him) to his native port Iolcus—victorious with the Argonauts" (Metamorphoses 7.149-158, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-jason-5]: "take from my life some years that I should live and add them to my father's ending days" (Metamorphoses 7.166-167, trans. Brookes More)

Pindar's Pythian IV offers a rich narrative of Jason's career. He had been raised for twenty years in Chiron's cave — "from Chariklo and Philyra I come, from the cave where the Centaur's pure daughters reared me up, and now have I fulfilled twenty years among them without deceitful word or deed."[^pin-chiron]

His arrival in Iolkos is described in vivid detail. He came "wielding two spears" and was dressed distinctively: "the vesture that was upon him was twofold, the garb of the Magnetes' country close fitting to his splendid limbs, but above he wore a leopard-skin to turn the hissing showers; nor were the bright locks of his hair shorn from him but over all his back ran rippling down."[^pin-appearance] Those who saw him wondered whether he was [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) or Ares. Pelias "was astonied when he gazed on the plain sign of the single sandal on the right foot."[^pin-sandal]

### Jason's Speech and the Quest (Pythian IV)

Jason addressed Pelias with measured diplomatic language, laying out his ancestral claim to the throne while explicitly offering peace: he would yield all herds and lands, but sought the throne itself. In response, Pelias charged him with fetching the fleece — invoking the ghost of Phrixos, which demanded it.[^pin-pelias]

### The Crew of the Argo (Pythian IV)

Pindar names several of the Argonauts assembled for the voyage: "three sons of Zeus" — including sons of [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md) (Echion and Eurytos), Zetes and Kalaïs with "bright wings shooting from their backs" (sons of Boreas), Orpheus ("the minstrel father of song"), and [Heracles](heracles.md).[^pin-crew] [Hera](../deities/hera.md) "kindled within those sons of gods the all-persuading sweet desire for the ship Argo, that none should be left behind and stay by his mother's side in savourless and riskless life."[^pin-hera-argo]

### Aphrodite's Wryneck Charm (Pythian IV)

At Colchis, [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md) brought "the frenzied bird, the speckled wry-neck, binding it to a four-spoked wheel without deliverance, and taught the son of Aison to be wise in prayers and charms, that he might make Medea take no thought to honour her parents, and longing for Hellas might drive her by persuasion's lash, her heart afire with love."[^pin-wryneck]

Medea "showed him the accomplishment of the tasks her father set, and mixing drugs with oil gave him for his anointment antidotes of cruel pain, and they vowed to be joined together in sweet wedlock."[^pin-medea-help] He ploughed with the fire-breathing bulls, sowed the dragon's teeth, and slew the "glaring speckled dragon... by subtlety."[^pin-dragon]

Pindar calls Medea "the murderess of Pelias" in a brief epithet summing up her later role.[^pin-medea-pelias]

[^pin-hera-argo]: "Hera kindled within those sons of gods the all-persuading sweet desire for the ship Argo, that none should be left behind and stay by his mother's side in savourless and riskless life, but each, even were death the price, achieve in company with his peers a magic potency of his valour" (Pindar, Pythian IV, trans.

## In Euripides' [Medea](../sources/euripides-medea.md)

### Jason's Defense

In Euripides' play, set in Corinth after Jason has married Glauce, Jason defends his new marriage as a pragmatic choice. He claims [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md), not [Medea](medea.md), saved him: "Venus alone both of Gods and men was the protectress of my voyage."[^eur-med-venus] He argues the marriage was for the family's benefit: "I thought worthy to wed thee... that we might live honorably, and might not be in want... and that having begotten brothers to those children sprung from thee, I might place them on the same footing."[^eur-med-brothers] He even claims: "It were well then that men should generate children from some other source, and that the female race should not exist."[^eur-med-misogyny]

[^eur-med-venus]: "Venus alone both of Gods and men was the protectress of my voyage" (Medea 527, trans. T.A. Buckley)
[^eur-med-brothers]: "that we might live honorably, and might not be in want... and that having begotten brothers to those children sprung from thee, I might place them on the same footing, and having united the family, I might flourish" (Medea 559-564)
[^eur-med-misogyny]: "It were well then that men should generate children from some other source, and that the female race should not exist, and thus there would not have been any evil among men" (Medea 573-575)

### Loss and Prophesied Death

After Medea kills their children, Jason arrives too late. The Chorus tells him: "Thy children are dead by their mother's hand."[^eur-med-dead] He calls Medea "a lioness, no woman, having a nature more savage than the Tuscan [Scylla](../creatures/scylla.md)."[^eur-med-lioness] He begs to touch the children's bodies: "Grant me, by the Gods, to touch the soft skin of my sons."[^eur-med-touch] Medea refuses and prophesies his death: "thou, wretch, as is fit, shalt die wretchedly, struck on thy head with a relic of thy ship [Argo](../objects/argo.md)."[^eur-med-prophecy]

[^eur-med-dead]: "Thy children are dead by their mother's hand" (Medea 1309)
[^eur-med-lioness]: "a lioness, no woman, having a nature more savage than the Tuscan Scylla" (Medea 1342-1343)
[^eur-med-touch]: "Grant me, by the Gods, to touch the soft skin of my sons" (Medea 1403)
[^eur-med-prophecy]: "thou, wretch, as is fit, shalt die wretchedly, struck on thy head with a relic of thy ship Argo, having seen the bitter end of my marriage" (Medea 1386-1388)
