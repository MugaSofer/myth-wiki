## Overview

**Jason** is the son of Aeson and Polymede, a hero who led the Argonauts to Colchis to retrieve the Golden Fleece. His story is told at length in the [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) (1.9.16-1.9.28).

## In the Bibliotheca

### The Oracle and the Single Sandal

Jason dwelt in Iolcus, where Pelias was king. Pelias "consulted the oracle concerning the kingdom" and "the god warned him to beware of the man with a single sandal."[^apd-oracle] When Pelias held a sacrifice to [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md), Jason hastened to attend, "and in crossing the river Anaurus he lost a sandal in the stream and landed with only one."[^apd-sandal]

Pelias asked Jason what he would do if he received an oracle that he should be murdered by a citizen. Jason answered — "whether at haphazard or instigated by the angry [Hera](../deities/hera.md) in order that [Medea](medea.md) should prove a curse to Pelias, who did not honor Hera" — that he would command the man to bring the Golden Fleece.[^apd-answer]

[^apd-oracle]: "when Pelias consulted the oracle concerning the kingdom, the god warned him to beware of the man with a single sandal" (Bibliotheca 1.9.16, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-sandal]: "in crossing the river Anaurus he lost a sandal in the stream and landed with only one" (Bibliotheca 1.9.16, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-answer]: "Jason answered, whether at haphazard or instigated by the angry Hera in order that Medea should prove a curse to Pelias, who did not honor Hera, 'I would command him,' said he, 'to bring the Golden Fleece'" (Bibliotheca 1.9.16, trans. Frazer)

### Building the Argo

Jason "called in the help of Argus, son of Phrixus; and Argus, by [Athena](../deities/athena.md)'s advice, built a ship of fifty oars named Argo after its builder; and at the prow Athena fitted in a speaking timber from the oak of Dodona."[^apd-argo]

[^apd-argo]: "Argus, by Athena's advice, built a ship of fifty oars named Argo after its builder; and at the prow Athena fitted in a speaking timber from the oak of Dodona" (Bibliotheca 1.9.16, trans. Frazer)

### The Voyage

The Argonauts' journey included many episodes:

- **Lemnos** (1.9.17): The Argonauts landed at Lemnos, bereft of men after the women killed their fathers and husbands (caused by [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md)'s curse). Jason bedded with Hypsipyle and bore sons Euneus and Nebrophonus.
- **Doliones** (1.9.18): Received kindly by King Cyzicus, but on departing by night they were driven back and fought the Doliones in mutual ignorance, slaying Cyzicus.
- **Mysia** (1.9.19): [Heracles](heracles.md) was left behind while searching for Hylas, who was "ravished away by nymphs on account of his beauty."[^apd-hylas]
- **Bebryces** (1.9.20): King Amycus, son of [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md), forced strangers to box. Pollux killed him with a blow on the elbow.
- **Phineus and the Harpies** (1.9.21): Phineus, a blind seer, was tormented by the [Harpies](../creatures/harpies.md). Zetes and Calais chased them away, and Phineus advised the Argonauts about the Clashing Rocks.
- **Clashing Rocks** (1.9.22): They sent a dove ahead; it passed safely (losing only the tip of its tail), and "with hard rowing and the help of [Hera](../deities/hera.md), they passed through."[^apd-clashing]
- **Colchis** (1.9.23): Jason was challenged to yoke brazen-footed fire-breathing bulls (gifts of [Hephaestus](../deities/hephaestus.md)) and sow dragon's teeth. [Medea](medea.md), "a witch, daughter of Aeetes," gave him a drug that made him immune to fire and iron for a single day.[^apd-medea-drug]

[^apd-hylas]: "Hylas, son of Thiodamas, a minion of Hercules, had been sent to draw water and was ravished away by nymphs on account of his beauty" (Bibliotheca 1.9.19, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-clashing]: "with hard rowing and the help of Hera, they passed through, the extremity of the ship's ornamented poop being shorn away right round" (Bibliotheca 1.9.22, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-medea-drug]: "she gave him a drug with which she bade him anoint his shield, spear, and body when he was about to yoke the bulls; for she said that, anointed with it, he could for a single day be harmed neither by fire nor by iron" (Bibliotheca 1.9.23, trans. Frazer)

### Winning the Fleece

Jason yoked the bulls, sowed the dragon's teeth, and slew the armed men that sprang from the ground. But Aeetes would not give the fleece and planned to burn the Argo. [Medea](medea.md) "brought Jason by night to the fleece, and having lulled to sleep by her drugs the dragon that guarded it, she possessed herself of the fleece and in Jason's company came to the Argo."[^apd-fleece]

[^apd-fleece]: "Medea brought Jason by night to the fleece, and having lulled to sleep by her drugs the dragon that guarded it, she possessed herself of the fleece and in Jason's company came to the Argo" (Bibliotheca 1.9.23, trans. Frazer)

### The Return

On the return voyage, [Medea](medea.md) murdered her brother Apsyrtus to delay Aeetes' pursuit. [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) sent a storm in anger, and the Argo spoke, saying they must be purified by [Circe](../deities/circe.md). They were purified at Aeaea, then passed the [Sirens](../creatures/sirens.md) (countered by Orpheus), [Scylla](../creatures/scylla.md) and the Wandering Rocks (steered through by [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md) and the Nereids at [Hera](../deities/hera.md)'s summons), and Crete (where Talos was defeated by Medea's wiles). They reached Iolcus "having completed the whole voyage in four months."[^apd-return]

[^apd-return]: "they sailed betwixt Euboea and Locris and came to Iolcus, having completed the whole voyage in four months" (Bibliotheca 1.9.26, trans. Frazer)

### After the Quest

Jason "surrendered the fleece, but though he longed to avenge his wrongs he bided his time." His father Aeson had been forced to suicide, his mother had hanged herself, and Pelias had slain her infant son. Jason "exhorted Medea to devise how he could punish Pelias." Medea persuaded Pelias's daughters to cut up their father and boil him, promising to make him young again — "she cut up a ram and made it into a lamb by boiling it. So they believed her, made mince meat of their father and boiled him."[^apd-pelias]

Acastus buried his father and expelled Jason and Medea from Iolcus. They went to Corinth, "and lived there happily for ten years." Then Jason married Glauce, daughter of King Creon, and divorced Medea. She killed the bride and Creon with a poisoned robe, slew her own children Mermerus and Pheres, and "having got from the Sun a car drawn by winged dragons she fled on it to Athens."[^apd-corinth]

[^apd-pelias]: "she repaired to the palace of Pelias and persuaded his daughters to make mince meat of their father and boil him, promising to make him young again by her drugs; and to win their confidence she cut up a ram and made it into a lamb by boiling it. So they believed her, made mince meat of their father and boiled him" (Bibliotheca 1.9.27, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-corinth]: "she sent the bride a robe steeped in poison, which when Glauce had put on, she was consumed with fierce fire along with her father, who went to her rescue. But Mermerus and Pheres, the children whom Medea had by Jason, she killed" (Bibliotheca 1.9.28, trans. Frazer)

## In the Odyssey

[Hera](../deities/hera.md) is said to have sent the Argo past the Wandering Rocks "for love of Jason."[^od12-argo]

[^od12-argo]: "One ship only of all that fare by sea hath passed that way, even Argo, that is in all men's minds, on her voyage from Aeetes. And even her the wave would lightly have cast there upon the mighty rocks, but Here sent her by for love of Jason." (Odyssey XII.6597-6600, trans. Butcher and Lang)

## In the Catalogue of Women

The Catalogue confirms Jason's parentage and adds his upbringing by [Chiron](../creatures/chiron.md): "Aeson, who begot a son Iason, shepherd of the people, whom Chiron brought up in woody Pelion."[^cat-jason]

[^cat-jason]: "Aeson, who begot a son Iason, shepherd of the people, whom Chiron brought up in woody Pelion" (Catalogue of Women, Fragment 13, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## In the Fabulae

### Pelias and the Oracle (§12)

Hyginus gives an oracle to Pelias different from the Bibliotheca's version: "An oracle bade Pelias, son of Cretheus and Tyro, sacrifice to [Neptune](../deities/poseidon.md), and told him his death was drawing near if a monocrepis, that is, a man wearing only one sandal, arrived."[^hyg12-oracle]

Jason arrived at the sacrifice having lost one sandal crossing "the river Evenus" (not Anaurus as in the Bibliotheca), and Pelias, "remembering the warning of the oracle, he bade him procure from King Aeetes, his enemy, the Golden Fleece of the ram which Phrixus had dedicated to Mars at Colchis."[^hyg12-task]

[^hyg12-oracle]: "An oracle bade Pelias, son of Cretheus and Tyro, sacrifice to Neptune, and told him his death was drawing near if a monocrepis, that is, a man wearing only one sandal, arrived" (Fabulae §12, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg12-task]: "When Pelias noticed this, remembering the warning of the oracle, he bade him procure from King Aeetes, his enemy, the Golden Fleece of the ram which Phrixus had dedicated to Mars at Colchis" (Fabulae §12, trans. Mary Grant)

### Juno at the River (§13)

The Fabulae preserves a fuller account of [Hera](../deities/hera.md)'s involvement: "When [Juno](../deities/hera.md), near the river Evenus, had changed her form to that of an old woman, and was waiting to test men's minds to see if they would carry her across the river Evenus, no one offered till Jason, son of Aeson and Alcimede, took her across."[^hyg13-juno] Her favor toward Jason was earned through this act of kindness, and "angry at Pelias for failing to sacrifice to her, she caused Jason to leave one sandal in the mud."[^hyg13-sandal]

[^hyg13-juno]: "When Juno, near the river Evenus, had changed her form to that of an old woman, and was waiting to test men's minds to see if they would carry her across the river Evenus, no one offered till Jason, son of Aeson and Alcimede, took her across" (Fabulae §13, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg13-sandal]: "But, angry at Pelias for failing to sacrifice to her, she caused Jason to leave one sandal in the mud" (Fabulae §13, trans. Mary Grant)

### The Argonauts Assembled (§14-14.5)

The Fabulae provides an extensive catalog of the Argonauts with genealogies and home cities. Jason is listed as "Jason, son of Aeson and Alcimede, Clymene's daughter, leader of the Thessalians."[^hyg14-jason] The list includes detailed information about each hero, their parentage, and their cities of origin, totaling "all these were called Minyae, either because daughters of Minyas bore most of them, or because Jason's mother was a daughter of Clymene, daughter of Minyas."[^hyg14-minyae]

The Fabulae also records the positions on the ship: "Jason, therefore, directed them. Argus, son of Danaus, was shipbuilder; Tiphys was pilot. After his death Ancaeus, son of Neptune, steered. Lynceus, son of Aphareus, who had keen sight, was the lookout man at the prow."[^hyg14-5-positions]

[^hyg14-jason]: "Jason, son of Aeson and Alcimede, Clymene's daughter, leader of the Thessalians" (Fabulae §14, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg14-minyae]: "Moreover, all these were called Minyae, either because daughters of Minyas bore most of them, or because Jason's mother was a daughter of Clymene, daughter of Minyas" (Fabulae §14.4, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg14-5-positions]: "Jason, therefore, directed them. Argus, son of Danaus, was shipbuilder; Tiphys was pilot. After his death Ancaeus, son of Neptune, steered. Lynceus, son of Aphareus, who had keen sight, was the lookout man at the prow" (Fabulae §14.5, trans. Mary Grant)

### Aeetes' Tasks (§22)

In Hyginus's account, Aeetes sets the tasks because "An oracle told Aeetes, son of [Sol](../deities/helius.md), that he would keep his kingdom as long as the fleece which Phrixus had dedicated should remain in the shrine of Mars."[^hyg22-oracle] The tasks are similar to other accounts: "to yoke with yoke of adamant the bronze-footed bulls which breathed flames from their nostrils, and plow, and sow from a helmet the dragon's teeth, from which a tribe of armed men should arise and slay each other."[^hyg22-tasks]

[Juno](../deities/hera.md)'s involvement is explained through Jason's earlier kindness: "Juno, however, wished to save Jason, because once when she had come to a river and wished to test the minds of men, she assumed an old woman's form, and asked to be carried across. He had carried her across when others who had passed over despised her."[^hyg22-juno] She arranged for [Venus](../deities/aphrodite.md) to inspire [Medea](medea.md) with love, "and so since she knew that Jason could not perform the commands without help of Medea, she asked Venus to inspire Medea with love."[^hyg22-venus]

[^hyg22-oracle]: "An oracle told Aeetes, son of Sol, that he would keep his kingdom as long as the fleece which Phrixus had dedicated should remain in the shrine of Mars" (Fabulae §22, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg22-tasks]: "to yoke with yoke of adamant the bronze-footed bulls which breathed flames from their nostrils, and plow, and sow from a helmet the dragon's teeth, from which a tribe of armed men should arise and slay each other" (Fabulae §22, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg22-juno]: "Juno, however, wished to save Jason, because once when she had come to a river and wished to test the minds of men, she assumed an old woman's form, and asked to be carried across. He had carried her across when others who had passed over despised her" (Fabulae §22, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg22-venus]: "And so since she knew that Jason could not perform the commands without help of Medea, she asked Venus to inspire Medea with love. At Venus' instigation, Jason was loved by Medea" (Fabulae §22, trans. Mary Grant)

### The Daughters of Pelias (§24)

After the quest, Jason's revenge on Pelias is described in detail. [Medea](medea.md) disguised herself "in the guise of a priestess of [Diana](../deities/artemis.md)" and promised to make Pelias young again.[^hyg24-disguise] When Pelias's eldest daughter Alcestis doubted, "Medea cast mist before them, and by means of drugs formed many strange things which seemed to be like reality, putting an old ram in a brazen vessel, from which a very fine young lamb seemed to spring."[^hyg24-ram]

Convinced by this demonstration, "the daughters of Pelias — namely, Alcestis, Pelopia, Medusa, Pisidice, and Hippothoe — at Medea's instigation slew their father and cooked him in a brazen caldron."[^hyg24-murder] After they realized the deception, "Jason, at a given signal of Medea, made himself the master of the palace, and handed over the rule to Acastus, son of Pelias, brother of the Peliades, because he had gone with him to Colchis."[^hyg24-acastus]

[^hyg24-disguise]: "And so, when they were now far from Colchis, she bade the ship be hidden in a secret place, and she herself in the guise of a priestess of Diana came to the daughters of Pelias" (Fabulae §24, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg24-ram]: "In order more easily to bend her to her will, Medea cast mist before them, and by means of drugs formed many strange things which seemed to be like reality, putting an old ram in a brazen vessel, from which a very fine young lamb seemed to spring" (Fabulae §24, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg24-murder]: "So in the same way the daughters of Pelias — namely, Alcestis, Pelopia, Medusa, Pisidice, and Hippothoe — at Medea's instigation slew their father and cooked him in a brazen caldron" (Fabulae §24, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg24-acastus]: "But Jason, at a given signal of Medea, made himself the master of the palace, and handed over the rule to Acastus, son of Pelias, brother of the Peliades, because he had gone with him to Colchis. He himself with Medea departed for Corinth" (Fabulae §24, trans. Mary Grant)
