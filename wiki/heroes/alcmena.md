## Overview

**Alcmena** was the mortal mother of [Heracles](heracles.md), whom she conceived by [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md). She was descended from [Perseus](perseus.md) through her father Electryon. In old age, she became a fierce protector of her grandchildren against [Eurystheus](eurystheus.md).

## In the Fabulae

Hyginus describes [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) prolonging the night to spend "one day and doubled two nights" with Alcmena, assuming Amphitryon's form and telling her of the sack of Oechalia. When Amphitryon returned and saw her lack of surprise, he realized a divinity had taken his place.[^hyg-zeus]

[^hyg-zeus]: Fabulae §29

## In Euripides' Heraclidae

Alcmena shelters her granddaughters inside the temple at Marathon while [Iolaus](iolaus.md) guards the boys at the altar. She is described as "the aged mother of your father" and "the old woman in the house."[^eur-hcl-shelter]

When the messenger first arrives with news of the battle, Alcmena's fierceness is immediately apparent — even before learning he brings good news, she threatens any herald who might try to take the children: "you shall never drag these away while I am living; else may I no longer be thought to be his mother; but if you touch them with your hand, you will have no honorable contest with two old people."[^eur-hcl-fierce]

### Confrontation with Eurystheus

Upon learning of [Eurystheus](eurystheus.md)'s capture, Alcmena's first reaction is to demand his death: "Thou needs must die miserably, and you shall gain every thing, for you ought to die not once only, having wrought many evil deeds."[^eur-hcl-revenge] She enumerates his crimes: sending [Heracles](heracles.md) against hydras and lions, driving her and the children out of all Greece as suppliants.

When told that Athenian law forbids killing prisoners of war, Alcmena is undeterred: "as for this man, since he has come into my power, there is no mortal who shall take him from me. For this, whoever will may call me bold, and thinking things too much for a woman; but this deed shall be done by me."[^eur-hcl-bold]

She finds a legal compromise — she will kill him and then return the body to his friends for burial, satisfying her vengeance while technically releasing the corpse. After hearing Eurystheus's prophecy that his burial will protect Athens, she seizes upon it as further reason to kill him: "Why then do ye delay, if you are fated to accomplish safety to the city and to your descendants, to slay this man?"[^eur-hcl-slay]
