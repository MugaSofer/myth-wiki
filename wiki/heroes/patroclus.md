|---|---|
| **Also known as** | Patroklos, the strong son of Menoitios |
| **Type** | Hero / Mortal |
| **Parents** | Menoitios (son of Actor) |
| **First appearance** | [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) I |

## Overview

**Patroclus** is Achilles' closest companion and the figure whose death drives the second half of the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md). He is killed by [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md), stripped of his armour by the god's own hands, and his death triggers Achilles' return to battle, the divine armour from [Hephaestus](../deities/hephaestus.md), and ultimately the fall of Hector. His ghost's appearance in Book XXIII is one of the poem's most important passages on the nature of the afterlife.

## Epithets

- **"Patroklos son of Menoitios"** / **"the strong son of Menoitios"** -- the standard patronymic[^ep-menoitios]

- **"knightly Patroklos"** -- used in his dying speech and other solemn passages[^ep-knightly]
- **"knight Patroklos"** / **"O knight Patroklos"** -- the narrator's direct address, a rare and poignant device[^ep-address]

## Parentage and Early Life

Patroclus is the son of Menoitios. The Catalogue of Women makes Menoitios the brother of Peleus, which would make Patroclus and [Achilles](achilles.md) first cousins: "Hesiod says that Menoethius the father of Patroclus, was a brother of Peleus, so that in that case they were first cousins."[^cat-cousin] This kinship is not stated in the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) but deepens their bond beyond mere companionship.

His ghost reveals his early history: Menoitios brought him as a child from Opoeis to Achilles' household "by reason of a grievous man-slaying, on the day when I slew Amphidamas' son, not willing it, in childish wrath over the dice. Then took me the knight Peleus into his house and reared me kindly and named me thy squire."[^il23-childhood]

[^cat-cousin]: "Hesiod says that Menoethius the father of Patroclus, was a brother of Peleus, so that in that case they were first cousins" (Catalogue of Women, Fragment 61, cited by Eustathius, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

[^il23-childhood]: "Menoitios brought me yet a little one from Opoeis to your country by reason of a grievous man-slaying, on the day when I slew Amphidamas' son, not willing it, in childish wrath over the dice. Then took me the knight Peleus into his house and reared me kindly and named me thy squire" (Iliad 23.97-102, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

## Appearance

The [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) gives no direct description of Patroclus's natural appearance. His visual presence in the poem is defined by borrowed equipment: in Book XVI, he arms himself in Achilles' own divine armour -- "his goodly greaves, fitted with silver clasps, he first girt round his legs, and next did on around his breast the well-dight starry corslet of the swift-footed son of Aiakos. And round his shoulders he cast a sword of bronze, with studs of silver, and next took the great and mighty shield, and on his proud head set a well-wrought helm with a horse-hair crest, and terribly nodded the crest from above."[^app-arming] The intent is that the Trojans "may take me for thee," suggesting he and Achilles are similar enough in build that the armour makes the deception plausible.

The only description of his features comes after death, when his ghost appears to Achilles: "in all things like his living self, in stature, and fair eyes, and voice, and the raiment of his body was the same."[^app-ghost] This tells us he had "fair eyes" and a recognisable stature, but nothing more specific.

[^app-arming]: "His goodly greaves, fitted with silver clasps, he first girt round his legs, and next did on around his breast the well-dight starry corslet of the swift-footed son of Aiakos. And round his shoulders he cast a sword of bronze, with studs of silver, and next took the great and mighty shield, and on his proud head set a well-wrought helm with a horse-hair crest, and terribly nodded the crest from above." (Iliad 16.157-165, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^app-ghost]: "in all things like his living self, in stature, and fair eyes, and voice, and the raiment of his body was the same" (Iliad 23.78-79, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

## In the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md)

### Achilles' Companion (Books I, IX)

From the poem's opening, Patroclus is at Achilles' side. When the heralds come to take Briseis, "Patroklos hearkened to his dear comrade, and led forth from the hut fair-cheeked Briseis."[^il1-briseis] In Book IX, during the embassy, Patroclus silently attends Achilles, preparing the meal and spreading beds for the envoys.

[^il1-briseis]: "Patroklos hearkened to his dear comrade, and led forth from the hut fair-cheeked Briseis" (Iliad 1.342, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

### The Appeal to Achilles (Book XVI)

In the pivotal scene of Book XVI, Patroclus comes weeping to Achilles as the Achaian ships burn. Achilles compares him to a little girl crying for her mother: "Wherefore weepest thou, Patroklos, like a fond little maid, that runs by her mother's side, and bids her mother take her up, snatching at her gown?"[^il16-weeping]

Patroclus lists the wounded heroes and rebukes Achilles' intransigence: "Pitiless that thou art, the knight Peleus was not then thy father, nor [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md) thy mother, but the grey sea bare thee, and the sheer cliffs, so untoward is thy spirit."[^il16-rebuke] He asks to wear Achilles' armour and lead the Myrmidons, "if perchance the Trojans may take me for thee, and so abstain from battle."

Achilles consents but warns him to go no further than driving the Trojans from the ships: "long not thou apart from me to fight with the war-loving Trojans... lest one of the eternal gods from Olympus come against thee; right dearly doth Apollo the Far-darter love them."[^il16-warning]

[^il16-weeping]: "Wherefore weepest thou, Patroklos, like a fond little maid, that runs by her mother's side, and bids her mother take her up, snatching at her gown, and hinders her in her going, and tearfully looks at her, till the mother takes her up?" (Iliad 16.18-22, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il16-rebuke]: "Pitiless that thou art, the knight Peleus was not then thy father, nor Thetis thy mother, but the grey sea bare thee, and the sheer cliffs, so untoward is thy spirit" (Iliad 16.49-52, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il16-warning]: "long not thou apart from me to fight with the war-loving Trojans; thereby wilt thou minish mine honour... lest one of the eternal gods from Olympus come against thee; right dearly doth Apollo the Far-darter love them" (Iliad 16.97-103, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

### Borrowing Achilles' Armour (Book XVI)

Patroclus arms himself in Achilles' divine equipment -- greaves, corslet, shield, helm, sword -- but notably not the Pelian spear: "he took not the spear of the noble son of Aiakos, heavy, and huge, and stalwart, that none other of the Achaians could wield."[^il16-spear] This detail is significant: even wearing Achilles' armour, Patroclus cannot fully become Achilles. The spear that no other man can lift marks the irreducible gap between them.

[^il16-spear]: "he took not the spear of the noble son of Aiakos, heavy, and huge, and stalwart, that none other of the Achaians could wield" (Iliad 16.167-170, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

### Apollo Drives Him from Troy's Wall (Book XVI)

Patroclus pushes the Trojans back, but exceeds Achilles' warning and assaults Troy itself. [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) drives him back three times: "Thrice clomb Patroklos on the corner of the lofty wall, and thrice did Apollo force him back and smote the shining shield with his immortal hands." On the fourth attempt, the god issues a terrible warning: "Give back, Patroklos of the seed of Zeus! Not beneath thy spear is it fated that the city of the valiant Trojans shall fall, nay nor beneath Achilles, a man far better than thou."[^il16-wall]

[^il16-wall]: "Thrice clomb Patroklos on the corner of the lofty wall, and thrice did Apollo force him back and smote the shining shield with his immortal hands. But when for the fourth time he came on like a god, then cried far-darting Apollo terribly, and spake winged words: 'Give back, Patroklos of the seed of Zeus! Not beneath thy spear is it fated that the city of the valiant Trojans shall fall, nay nor beneath Achilles, a man far better than thou'" (Iliad 16.637-647, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

### Apollo Slays Patroclus (Book XVI)

The death of Patroclus is one of the most carefully described divine interventions in the poem. [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) attacks from behind, hidden in mist, and systematically strips him of all his borrowed divine equipment:

"Phoebus met thee in the strong battle, in dreadful wise. And Patroklos was not ware of him coming through the press, for hidden in thick mist did he meet him, and stood behind him, and smote his back and broad shoulders with a down-stroke of his hand, and his eyes were dazed. And from his head Phoebus Apollo smote the helmet... And all the long-shadowed spear was shattered in the hands of Patroklos... while from his shoulders the tasselled shield with the baldric fell to the ground. And the prince Apollo, son of Zeus, loosed his corslet, and blindness seized his heart and his shining limbs were unstrung."[^il16-apollo-strikes]

The stripping is theological: Apollo removes each piece of borrowed divine armour, returning Patroclus to his mortal vulnerability. Euphorbus wounds him from behind, and finally Hector delivers the killing blow.

[^il16-apollo-strikes]: "Phoebus met thee in the strong battle, in dreadful wise. And Patroklos was not ware of him coming through the press, for hidden in thick mist did he meet him, and stood behind him, and smote his back and broad shoulders with a down-stroke of his hand, and his eyes were dazed. And from his head Phoebus Apollo smote the helmet... And all the long-shadowed spear was shattered in the hands of Patroklos... while from his shoulders the tasselled shield with the baldric fell to the ground. And the prince Apollo, son of Zeus, loosed his corslet, and blindness seized his heart and his shining limbs were unstrung" (Iliad 16.750-768, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

### Dying Words (Book XVI)

Patroclus's last words attribute his death to god and fate before any mortal: "Boast greatly, as now, Hector, for to thee have Zeus, son of Kronos, and Apollo given the victory, who lightly have subdued me; for themselves stripped my harness from my shoulders. But if twenty such as thou had encountered me, here had they all perished, subdued beneath my spear. But me have ruinous Fate and the son of Leto slain, and of men Euphorbos, but thou art the third in my slaying."[^il16-dying]

He then prophesies Hector's own death: "verily thou thyself art not long to live, but already doth Death stand hard by thee, and strong Fate, that thou art to be subdued by the hands of noble Achilles."[^il16-prophecy]

"And his soul, fleeting from his limbs, went down to the house of Hades, wailing its own doom, leaving manhood and youth."[^il16-soul]

[^il16-dying]: "me have ruinous Fate and the son of Leto slain, and of men Euphorbos, but thou art the third in my slaying" (Iliad 16.827-829, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il16-prophecy]: "verily thou thyself art not long to live, but already doth Death stand hard by thee, and strong Fate, that thou art to be subdued by the hands of noble Achilles, of the seed of Aiakos" (Iliad 16.832-836, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il16-soul]: "his soul, fleeting from his limbs, went down to the house of Hades, wailing its own doom, leaving manhood and youth" (Iliad 16.840-842, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

### Achilles' Grief and Thetis's Lament (Book XVIII)

The news of Patroclus's death triggers one of the poem's great mythological sequences. Achilles' grief summons [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md) from the sea with the Nereids, who lament: "Fallen is Patroklos." Thetis confirms Achilles' doom: "Short-lived, I ween, must thou be then, my child, by what thou sayest, for straightway after Hector is death appointed unto thee."[^il18-thetis]

[Athena](../deities/athena.md) then casts her aegis around Achilles and sets blazing fire on his head -- "Pallas Athene uttered her voice, and spread terror unspeakable among the men of Troy" -- enabling him to recover the body. Thetis commissions new divine armour from [Hephaestus](../deities/hephaestus.md).[^il18-shout]

[^il18-thetis]: "Short-lived, I ween, must thou be then, my child, by what thou sayest, for straightway after Hector is death appointed unto thee" (Iliad 18.109-111, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il18-shout]: See [Athena](../deities/athena.md) -- "Pallas Athene uttered her voice, and spread terror unspeakable among the men of Troy" (Iliad 18.155, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

### The Ghost of Patroclus (Book XXIII)

Patroclus's ghost appears to Achilles in sleep, and the passage is one of the most theologically significant in the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md). The ghost appears "in all things like his living self, in stature, and fair eyes, and voice, and the raiment of his body was the same."[^il23-ghost-appears]

He asks for burial so that he may enter the underworld: "Bury me with all speed, that I pass the gates of Hades. Far off the spirits banish me, the phantoms of men outworn, nor suffer me to mingle with them beyond the River, but vainly I wander along the wide-gated dwelling of Hades."[^il23-ghost-plea]

He asks that their bones be placed together: "Lay not my bones apart from thine, Achilles, but together, even as we were nurtured in your house."[^il23-ghost-bones]

When Achilles reaches out to embrace him, "like a vapour the spirit was gone beneath the earth with a faint shriek." Achilles' reaction is a key theological statement: "Ay me, there remaineth then even in the house of Hades a spirit and phantom of the dead, albeit the life be not anywise therein."[^il23-ghost-vanish]

This passage establishes that the dead possess form and identity but not the "heart of life" -- they are recognisable but ultimately insubstantial. The unburied dead are denied entry even to this diminished existence.

[^il23-ghost-appears]: "then came there unto him the spirit of hapless Patroklos, in all things like his living self, in stature, and fair eyes, and voice, and the raiment of his body was the same" (Iliad 23.76-79, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il23-ghost-plea]: "Bury me with all speed, that I pass the gates of Hades. Far off the spirits banish me, the phantoms of men outworn, nor suffer me to mingle with them beyond the River, but vainly I wander along the wide-gated dwelling of Hades" (Iliad 23.81-86, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il23-ghost-bones]: "Lay not my bones apart from thine, Achilles, but together, even as we were nurtured in your house" (Iliad 23.95-96, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il23-ghost-vanish]: "like a vapour the spirit was gone beneath the earth with a faint shriek... Ay me, there remaineth then even in the house of Hades a spirit and phantom of the dead, albeit the life be not anywise therein" (Iliad 23.114-118, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

## In the [Epic Cycle](../sources/epic-cycle.md)

### The Cypria

In the Cypria, Patroclus is mentioned as having killed "Sarpedon's son" during the early fighting at Troy -- a detail absent from the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md), where his only major martial action occurs in Book XVI.[^cyp-patroclus]

[^cyp-patroclus]: Cypria, summary by Proclus (trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## In the Fabulae

### The Death of Patroclus (§106)

In Hyginus's account, when [Agamemnon](agamemnon.md) took Briseis from [Achilles](achilles.md), "Achilles, at Patroclus' pleading, gave him his armor."[^hyg-106-armor] Wearing Achilles' equipment, Patroclus "put the Trojans to flight, since they thought he was Achilles, and he slew Sarpedon, son of [Jove](../deities/zeus.md) and Europa."[^hyg-106-sarpedon]

"Later Patroclus himself was killed by [Hector](hector.md) and the armor taken from his body."[^hyg-106-death] This prompted Achilles to reconcile with Agamemnon; [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md) then secured new armor from [Vulcan](../deities/hephaestus.md), and "the Nereids brought it to him over the sea."[^hyg-106-armor-new]
