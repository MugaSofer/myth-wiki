## Overview

**Actaeon** was a hunter trained by the centaur [Chiron](../creatures/chiron.md). He is famous for being transformed into a stag by the goddess [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md) and subsequently devoured by his own hunting dogs—a fate that became proverbial for death brought about by one's own means.

## In the Bibliotheca

According to Apollodorus, Actaeon "was bred by Chiron to be a hunter and then afterwards was devoured on Cithaeron by his own dogs."[^apd-death] The reasons for his fate differ between sources: "He perished in that way, according to Acusilaus, because Zeus was angry at him for wooing Semele; but according to the more general opinion, it was because he saw Artemis bathing."[^apd-causes]

When he saw the goddess bathing, "the goddess at once transformed him into a deer, and drove mad the fifty dogs in his pack, which devoured him unwittingly."[^apd-transformation] After his death, "the dogs sought their master howling lamentably, and in the search they came to the cave of Chiron, who fashioned an image of Actaeon, which soothed their grief."[^apd-chiron]

## In the Fabulae

Hyginus records a similar account: "Actaeon, son of Aristaeus and Autonoe, a shepherd, saw Diana bathing and desired to ravish her. Angry at this, Diana made horns grow on his head, and he was devoured by his own dogs."[^hyg-actaeon]
