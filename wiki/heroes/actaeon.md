## Overview

**Actaeon** was a hunter trained by the centaur [Chiron](../creatures/chiron.md). He is famous for being transformed into a stag by the goddess [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md) and subsequently devoured by his own hunting dogs—a fate that became proverbial for death brought about by one's own means.

## In the Bibliotheca

According to Apollodorus, Actaeon "was bred by Chiron to be a hunter and then afterwards was devoured on Cithaeron by his own dogs."[^apd-death] The reasons for his fate differ between sources: "He perished in that way, according to Acusilaus, because Zeus was angry at him for wooing Semele; but according to the more general opinion, it was because he saw Artemis bathing."[^apd-causes]

When he saw the goddess bathing, "the goddess at once transformed him into a deer, and drove mad the fifty dogs in his pack, which devoured him unwittingly."[^apd-transformation] After his death, "the dogs sought their master howling lamentably, and in the search they came to the cave of Chiron, who fashioned an image of Actaeon, which soothed their grief."[^apd-chiron]

## In Callimachus's Hymns

In Hymn V (On the Bath of Pallas), [Athena](../deities/athena.md) prophesies Actaeon's fate while consoling Chariclo, the mother of [Teiresias](teiresias.md), after blinding her son. Athena compares the two cases: "How many burnt offerings shall the daughter of Cadmus burn in the days to come? How many [Aristaeus](aristaeus.md)? — praying that they might see their only son, the young Actaeon, blind." But Actaeon's fate will be far worse: "neither the chase nor comradeship in archery on the hills shall save in that hour, when, albeit unwillingly, he shall behold the beauteous bath of the goddess. Nay, his own dogs shall then devour their former lord. And his mother shall gather the bones of her son, ranging over all the thickets."[^call-actaeon]

[^call-actaeon]: "How many burnt offerings shall the daughter of Cadmus burn... praying that they might see their only son, the young Actaeon, blind... his own dogs shall then devour their former lord. And his mother shall gather the bones of her son, ranging over all the thickets" (Callimachus, Hymn V.107-118, trans. A.W. Mair)

## In the Fabulae

Hyginus records a similar account: "Actaeon, son of Aristaeus and Autonoe, a shepherd, saw Diana bathing and desired to ravish her. Angry at this, Diana made horns grow on his head, and he was devoured by his own dogs."[^hyg-actaeon]
