# Invulnerability

**Invulnerability** — immunity to weapons or wounds — appears across Greek mythology as a divine gift, often with a critical limitation or workaround. The sources describe several distinct forms: total resistance to piercing weapons (sometimes bypassed by crushing), bodies made of impenetrable material, and a single vulnerable point.

## Notable Examples

### Caeneus

[Caeneus](../heroes/caeneus.md), born a woman named Caenis, received invulnerability from [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) along with a change of sex. [Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) reports that "Poseidon had intercourse with her, she asked to become an invulnerable man; wherefore in the battle with the centaurs he thought scorn of wounds and killed many of the centaurs."[^apd-caeneus] In Ovid's telling, Poseidon "made the new man proof against all wounds of spear or sword."[^met-caeneus]

Caeneus's invulnerability was absolute against bladed weapons — swords shattered on his skin, spears bounced off — but the [centaurs](../creatures/centaurs.md) found a workaround: they buried him under an avalanche of trees. Apollodorus says they killed him "by striking him with fir trees."[^apd-caeneus-death] Ovid describes Caeneus suffocating under a forest stripped from Mount Othrys.[^met-caeneus-death]

[Hyginus](../sources/hyginus.md) is sceptical of the whole tradition, remarking: "This has never been done, nor is it possible for any mortal by invulnerability to escape death by steel, or be changed from a woman into a man."[^hyg-sceptical]

### Cygnus, Son of Poseidon

[Cygnus](../heroes/cygnus.md), another son of [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md), displayed similar weapon-proof flesh at [Troy](../places/troy.md). In [Ovid](../sources/metamorphoses.md)'s account, [Achilles](../heroes/achilles.md)' spears, thrown with full force, could not pierce him: "Nor did a third spear injure Cygnus, though he stood there with his body all exposed." Even a sword "was even blunted on the flesh."[^met-cygnus] Like Caeneus, Cygnus was defeated not by a weapon but by strangulation — Achilles knocked him down and choked him with his own helmet straps.[^met-cygnus-death]

Ovid explicitly connects the two cases: [Nestor](../heroes/nestor.md), hearing of Cygnus's invulnerability, responds by telling the story of Caeneus — "the only man you knew who could despise all weapons and whose flesh could not be pierced by thrust of sword or spear. But long ago I saw another man able to bear unharmed a thousand strokes."[^met-nestor]

### The Nemean Lion

The [Nemean Lion](../creatures/nemean-lion.md) was "an invulnerable beast begotten by [Typhon](../creatures/typhoeus.md)." [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) first "shot an arrow at him, but when he perceived that the beast was invulnerable, he heaved up his club and made after him."[^apd-lion] Heracles ultimately strangled the lion — the same solution Achilles would later use against Cygnus.

### Talos

[Talos](../creatures/talos.md), the bronze giant of Crete, had a body "fashioned of bronze and invulnerable; but beneath the sinew by his ankle was a blood-red vein; and this, with its issues of life and death, was covered by a thin skin."[^arg-talos] [Medea](../heroes/medea.md) exploited this single weak point to destroy him — a different model of invulnerability, where the vulnerability is localised rather than absent.

### Achilles

[Achilles](../heroes/achilles.md) was killed "shot with an arrow in the ankle by Alexander and Apollo at the Scaean gate."[^apd-achilles] Statius's [Achilleid](../sources/achilleid.md) provides the explicit account of the Styx dipping: [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md) says "if at thy birth I fortified thee with the stern waters of Styx — ay, would I had wholly!"[^ach-styx] — the "would I had wholly!" implying the heel by which she held him was left unprotected. The Greek army speaks of him as one "whom a Nereid took by stealth through the Stygian waters and made his fair limbs impenetrable to steel."[^ach-styx-army] Like [Talos](../creatures/talos.md), Achilles' invulnerability has a single localised weakness.

### Otos and Ephialtes

[Hyginus](../sources/hyginus.md) reports a variant tradition in which the twin giants Otos and Ephialtes "were invulnerable sons of Neptune and Iphimede." Since [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md) "could not resist their strength," [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) "sent a deer between them. Driven mad by anger in trying to kill it with javelins, they killed each other" — circumventing their invulnerability by tricking them into becoming their own weapons.[^hyg-aloads]

## Patterns

Several recurring features emerge from these accounts:

- **Divine parentage**: Invulnerability is typically connected to [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) (Caeneus, Cygnus, Talos) or other major gods.
- **Circumvention, not defeat**: Invulnerable beings are never overcome by sharper or stronger weapons. Instead, their killers find alternatives — crushing (trees, stones), strangulation, or exploiting a single weak point.
- **Mortality preserved**: Even the invulnerable die. The gift delays death but never prevents it entirely.
