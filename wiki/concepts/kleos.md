## Overview

***Kleos*** — glory or fame — is the paramount value of the heroic world in the sources. It is what survives death: the renown that men carry in their memory and poets preserve in song. The word appears constantly in Homer, where it denotes both the act of hearing about great deeds and the lasting reputation those deeds create.

The concept is inseparable from mortality. Because heroes must die, *kleos* is the only form of immortality available to them. This produces the central tension of the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md): the choice between a long life and imperishable fame.

## Achilles' Choice

The definitive statement of *kleos* in the sources is [Achilles](../heroes/achilles.md)' speech in [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book 9, where he reveals that his mother [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md) told him of two fates: "twain fates are bearing me to the issue of death. If I abide here and besiege the Trojans' city, then my returning home is taken from me, but my fame shall be imperishable; but if I go home to my dear native land, my high fame is taken from me, but my life shall endure long while, neither shall the issue of death soon reach me."[^il9-fates]

This frames *kleos* and *nostos* (homecoming) as mutually exclusive. Achilles must choose between glory and life — and in this moment of anger at [Agamemnon](../heroes/agamemnon.md), he declares that he will go home. Yet ultimately he stays, and his fame becomes the greatest of all.

The irony deepens in the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md), where [Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md) meets Achilles among the dead and praises his glory: "with the gods, and now thou art a great prince here among the dead. Wherefore let not thy death be any grief to thee, Achilles." Achilles replies with devastating frankness: "speak not comfortably to me of death, oh great Odysseus. Rather would I live on ground as the hireling of another, with a landless man who had no great livelihood, than bear sway among all the dead that be departed."[^od11-achilles] The hero who chose imperishable fame over a long life wishes he had chosen differently.

## Sarpedon's Speech

[Sarpedon](../heroes/sarpedon.md)'s speech to Glaucus in [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book 12 gives the philosophical foundation for the pursuit of *kleos*. He begins by noting that they are honoured as kings in Lycia — "our kings that rule Lykia be no inglorious men" — and argues that this honour obliges them to fight in the front ranks. Then he reaches the crux: "if once escaped from this battle we were for ever to be ageless and immortal, neither would I fight myself in the foremost ranks, nor would I send thee into the war that giveth men renown, but now — for assuredly ten thousand fates of death do every way beset us, and these no mortal may escape nor avoid — now let us go forward, whether we shall give glory to other men, or others to us."[^il12-sarpedon]

The logic is clear: because death is inescapable, the only question is whether it will come with or without glory. If men were immortal, risking one's life would be irrational. But since death comes regardless, the warrior's choice is not *whether* to die but *how*.

## Hector's Resolve

[Hector](../heroes/hector.md) articulates a similar ethic in Iliad Book 6, speaking to [Andromache](../heroes/andromache.md) before returning to battle. He acknowledges that Troy will fall — "yea of a surety I know this in heart and soul; the day shall come for holy Ilios to be laid low, and Priam and the folk of Priam of the good ashen spear" — yet refuses to withdraw: "I have learnt ever to be valiant and fight in the forefront of the Trojans, winning my father's great glory and mine own."[^il6-hector]

For Hector, *kleos* is inherited as well as earned: his father's glory and his own are intertwined. The passage is also notable for its clear-eyed acceptance of doom — Hector fights not because he expects to win, but because fighting is what earns glory.

## Hector on Omens

When Polydamas counsels retreat based on a bird-omen, Hector dismisses it with one of the Iliad's most famous lines: "one omen is best, to fight for our own country."[^il12-hector-omen] This subordinates every other form of knowledge — divine signs, prophecy, caution — to the imperative of earning glory in defence of one's people.

## Kleos and Song

In Homer, *kleos* is explicitly tied to the poet's craft. The [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) opens with [Penelope](../heroes/penelope.md) hearing the minstrel Phemius sing "the songs of famous men" — specifically "the pitiful return of the Achaeans, that Pallas Athene laid on them as they came forth from Troy."[^od1-phemius] The heroes' sufferings become song, and that song is their *kleos*.

The link is made explicit again in Odyssey Book 8, where the Phaeacian bard Demodocus sings among them, for "the Muse stirred the minstrel to sing the songs of famous men, even that lay whereof the fame had then reached the wide heaven, namely, the quarrel between Odysseus and Achilles."[^od8-demodocus]

## Penelope's Kleos

The ghost of [Agamemnon](../heroes/agamemnon.md) in [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) Book 24 offers a striking application of *kleos* to a woman's virtue. He tells Odysseus: "so good was the wisdom of constant Penelope, daughter of Icarius, that was duly mindful of Odysseus, her wedded lord. Wherefore the fame of her virtue shall never perish, but the immortals will make a gracious song in the ears of men on earth to the fame of constant Penelope."[^od24-penelope]

He contrasts this directly with [Clytemnestra](../heroes/clytemnestra.md): "in far other wise did the daughter of Tyndareus devise ill deeds, and slay her wedded lord, and hateful shall the song of her be among men, and an evil repute hath she brought upon all womankind."[^od24-clytemnestra] Both women receive *kleos* — fame preserved in song — but one is "gracious" and the other "hateful." Glory, the passage implies, can be earned for faithfulness as well as martial prowess.

## The Anti-Kleos of the Suitors' Victim

Earlier in the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md), the opposite of *kleos* is presented as the worst possible fate. [Penelope](../heroes/penelope.md) laments that [Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md) disappeared without trace: "He is gone, lost to sight and hearsay, but for me hath he left anguish and lamentation."[^od1-penelope] If Odysseus had died at Troy, "the whole Achaean host would have builded him a barrow, and even for his son would he have won great glory in the after days. But now the spirits of the storm have swept him away inglorious."[^od1-inglorious] To die without *kleos* — without even a tomb — is worse than death in battle.

## The Assembly as Kleos

Homer identifies the assembly — the space of public speech — as itself a form of glory. In Iliad Book 1, when Achilles withdraws from battle, he also withdraws from "the assembly that is the hero's glory."[^il1-assembly] Kleos is won not only by fighting but by speaking among peers.

## In Pindar

[Pindar](../sources/pindar.md) is the poet of *kleos* by profession — his odes celebrate athletic victors and preserve their achievements in song. He regularly connects present victories to mythological precedent. In Olympian 1, he describes how [Pelops](../heroes/pelops.md)'s fame endures through his tomb at Olympia: "from afar off he beholdeth the glory of the Olympian games in the courses called of Pelops, where is striving of swift feet and of strong bodies brave to labour."[^pin-pelops]
