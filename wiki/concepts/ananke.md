# Ananke (Necessity)

## Overview

**Ananke** (Ἀνάγκη), or Necessity, is a concept and sometimes personified force representing the inescapable compulsion of fate. In the sources, Ananke is depicted as a power that even the gods cannot overcome.

## In Euripides' Alcestis

The Chorus of [Euripides' Alcestis](../sources/euripides-alcestis.md) declares Necessity the greatest force in existence: "I too have both been borne aloft through song, and having very much handled arguments have found nothing more powerful than Necessity: nor is there any cure in the Thracian tablets which Orpheus wrote."[^alc-chorus]

They add that she is unapproachable: "neither to the altars nor to the image of this Goddess alone, is it lawful to approach, she hears not victims." Even [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) works through her: "Jove, whatever he have assented to, with thee brings this to pass."[^alc-zeus]

[^alc-chorus]: "I too have both been borne aloft through song, and having very much handled arguments have found nothing more powerful than Necessity: nor is there any cure in the Thracian tablets which Orpheus wrote" (Alcestis ~962-970, trans. T.A. Buckley)
[^alc-zeus]: "neither to the altars nor to the image of this Goddess alone, is it lawful to approach, she hears not victims... Jove, whatever he have assented to, with thee brings this to pass" (Alcestis ~970-978, trans. T.A. Buckley)
