# Hubris

## Overview

**Hubris** (ὕβρις) is excessive pride, arrogance, or presumption against the gods — the transgression of mortal limits. In the mythological sources, hubris consistently provokes divine punishment. It is often the fatal flaw that brings about a character's downfall.

## Examples in the Sources

### Mortals Against Gods

- **Niobe** ([Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md) 6, [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) 3.5.6): Boasted that she surpassed [Leto](../deities/leto.md) in children; [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) and [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md) slew all her offspring.
- **Arachne** ([Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md) 6): Challenged [Athena](../deities/athena.md) to a weaving contest and was transformed into a spider.
- **Marsyas** ([Fabulae](../sources/hyginus.md) §165, [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md) 6): Challenged Apollo to a musical contest and was flayed alive after losing.
- **[Agamemnon](../heroes/agamemnon.md)** ([Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) E.3.21): Boasted that "Artemis herself could not" match his hunting shot; [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md) punished him by becalming the fleet until he sacrificed [Iphigenia](../heroes/iphigenia.md).
- **Cassiopeia** ([Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) 2.4.3): Boasted her daughter was more beautiful than the Nereids; [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) sent a sea-monster.
- **[Tantalus](../heroes/tantalus.md)**: Shared ambrosia with mortals or served his son to the gods — punished with eternal torment in [Hades](../deities/hades.md).

### The Purple Carpet (Aeschylus' Agamemnon)

In a famous scene, [Clytemnestra](../heroes/clytemnestra.md) persuades [Agamemnon](../heroes/agamemnon.md) to walk on purple tapestries — a gesture of divine honour. Agamemnon himself recognizes the danger: "strew not my path with robes; such honour well may rouse the gods' displeasure."[^ag-purple] His yielding to the temptation marks his doom.

[^ag-purple]: "strew not my path with robes; such honour well may rouse the gods' displeasure" (Agamemnon ~920, trans. E.D.A. Morshead)

### Divine Vengeance

The sources consistently show that hubris invites nemesis (divine retribution). As the Chorus in Aeschylus' [Agamemnon](../sources/aeschylus-agamemnon.md) warns, the gods watch those who prosper excessively. The pattern is: mortal overreaches → god notices → punishment follows.

## Hybris as a Deity

In the [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) (3.8.1), Hybris appears as a personification — a Naiad nymph who is the mother of [Pan](../deities/pan.md) by [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md). This is otherwise unattested.
