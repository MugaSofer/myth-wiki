## Overview

Sacrifice, libation, prayer, and purification are pervasive in the Greek mythological sources — not as background detail but as the primary mechanism by which mortals and gods interact. The sources describe a world in which the gods expect worship, notice its absence, and punish those who withhold it. [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) himself attests that [Troy](../places/troy.md) was honoured above all cities because "never did mine altar lack the seemly feast, even drink-offering and burnt-offering, the worship that is our due."[^il4-troy]

[^il4-troy]: "Of all cities beneath sun and starry heaven that are the dwelling of mortal men, holy Ilios was most honoured of my heart, and Priam and the folk of Priam of the good ashen spear. For never did mine altar lack the seemly feast, even drink-offering and burnt-offering, the worship that is our due" (Iliad 4.44-48, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

## The Mecone Sacrifice

The foundational myth of Greek sacrifice appears in Hesiod's [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md). "When the gods and mortal men had a dispute at Mecone," [Prometheus](../deities/prometheus.md) divided an ox into two portions: the good meat hidden under an ox paunch to look unappetizing, and worthless white bones covered in shining fat to look appetizing. Zeus chose the bones — and though he "saw and failed not to perceive the trick," his wrath established the pattern forever after.[^theog-trick]

"Because of this the tribes of men upon earth burn white bones to the deathless gods upon fragrant altars" — an explicit aetiology for the Greek practice of burning bones and fat for the gods while mortals eat the meat.[^theog-sacrifice] Sacrifice is thus framed from the outset as a division: gods and mortals once feasted together, but now they are separated, and the ritual marks that separation.

[^theog-trick]: "Zeus, whose wisdom is everlasting, saw and failed not to perceive the trick, and in his heart he thought mischief against mortal men which also was to be fulfilled. With both hands he took up the white fat and was angry at heart, and wrath came to his spirit when he saw the white ox-bones craftily tricked out" (Theogony 550-557)
[^theog-sacrifice]: "because of this the tribes of men upon earth burn white bones to the deathless gods upon fragrant altars" (Theogony 556-557)

## Libation

The simplest and most frequent form of worship in the sources. [Hestia](../deities/hestia.md) receives the first and last libation at every banquet: "without you mortals hold no banquet, — where one does not duly pour sweet wine in offering to Hestia both first and last."[^hh29-hestia] This positions her as framing every communal meal, bookending the feast with divine acknowledgement.

In the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md), the swineherd Eumaeus — hardly an aristocrat — pours a portion "for the nymphs and for [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md) son of Maia," showing that libation was not confined to grand occasions but belonged to everyday rural piety.[^od14-eumaeus] After a night raid in the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md), [Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md) and [Diomedes](../heroes/diomedes.md) "drew off the honey-sweet wine, and poured it forth to [Athena](../deities/athena.md)."[^il10-spoils]

[^hh29-hestia]: "without you mortals hold no banquet, — where one does not duly pour sweet wine in offering to Hestia both first and last" (Homeric Hymn XXIX to Hestia 5-6, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^od14-eumaeus]: "A portion for the nymphs and for Hermes son of Maia" (Odyssey 14.420-423)
[^il10-spoils]: "They drew off the honey-sweet wine, and poured it forth to Athene" (Iliad 10.574, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

## Animal Sacrifice and Hecatombs

Large-scale animal sacrifice — the hecatomb (literally "a hundred oxen," though the term was used broadly) — is the standard form of communal worship. At Pylos, [Telemachus](../heroes/telemachus.md) finds [Nestor](../heroes/nestor.md) and his people sacrificing black bulls to [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md). When [Athena](../deities/athena.md) departs in the form of a sea-eagle, Nestor recognises her as divine and vows a gilded heifer in her honour.[^od3-pylos]

The efficacy of sacrifice is not guaranteed. In the Iliad, the Trojans sacrifice to the gods but "the blessed gods regaled not themselves... for sore was holy Ilios hated of them." The gods can refuse offerings from those they have condemned.[^il-refuse]

[^od3-pylos]: Odyssey 3. Nestor's sacrifice to Poseidon at Pylos; gilded heifer vowed to Athena after her departure.
[^il-refuse]: Iliad 8. "The blessed gods regaled not themselves" with Troy's sacrifice.

## Vows and Their Consequences

A vow to sacrifice, once made, is binding. [Minos](../heroes/minos.md) prayed for a bull from the sea, promising to sacrifice it to [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md). "Poseidon sent him up a fine bull, and Minos sent it to the herds and sacrificed another instead." The god's retribution was devastating: he made the bull savage and caused [Pasiphae](../heroes/pasiphae.md) to fall in love with it, ultimately producing the [Minotaur](../creatures/minotaur.md).[^apd-minos]

Similarly, [Laomedon](../heroes/priam.md) vowed to pay [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) and [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) for building Troy's walls but "defaulted on through avarice." The consequence was a sea-monster that ravaged the land.[^hyg-laomedon]

[^apd-minos]: "Poseidon sent him up a fine bull, and Minos sent it to the herds and sacrificed another instead" (Bibliotheca 3.1.3-4, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^hyg-laomedon]: Fabulae §89. Laomedon refused payment for Apollo and Poseidon's service building Troy's walls.

## Human Sacrifice

The sources treat human sacrifice with a mix of horror and awe. The most fully documented case is the sacrifice of [Iphigenia](../heroes/iphigenia.md) at Aulis, told across four sources. In Euripides' telling, Iphigenia reverses her plea for life and volunteers: "I give my body for Greece. Sacrifice it, and sack Troy. For this for a long time will be my memorial, and this my children, my wedding, and my glory."[^eur-ia] In every version, [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md) intervenes — substituting a deer at the moment of the blow and transporting Iphigenia away.

[Polyxena](../heroes/hecuba.md) is sacrificed at [Achilles](../heroes/achilles.md)' tomb after the fall of Troy. His ghost appeared "as large as when he lived, with look as fierce" and demanded her blood.[^met-polyxena] In Euripides' [Hecuba](../sources/euripides-hecuba.md), she dies heroically: "Polyxena would never wish to live in slavery."

[Erechtheus](../heroes/erechtheus.md) sacrificed his own daughter to win victory against Eumolpus in battle for [Athens](../places/athens.md).[^apd-erechtheus] In the [Phoenissae](../sources/euripides-phoenissae.md), [Tiresias](../heroes/tiresias.md) demands Menoeceus's self-sacrifice to save [Thebes](../places/thebes.md). [Busiris](../heroes/heracles.md) in Egypt "sacrificed strangers on an altar of Zeus" until [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) broke his bonds and killed him.[^apd-busiris]

These episodes share a pattern: human sacrifice is terrible, but the gods sometimes demand it — and those who submit willingly are honoured or rescued.

[^eur-ia]: "I give my body for Greece. Sacrifice it, and sack Troy. For this for a long time will be my memorial, and this my children, my wedding, and my glory" (Iphigenia in Aulis ~1397-1399, trans. T.A. Buckley)
[^met-polyxena]: "As large as when he lived, with look as fierce" — Achilles' ghost demanded Polyxena's sacrifice (Metamorphoses 13.440-467)
[^apd-erechtheus]: Bibliotheca 3.15.4. Erechtheus sacrificed his daughter for victory.
[^apd-busiris]: "Hercules also was seized and haled to the altars, but he burst his bonds and slew both Busiris and his son Amphidamas" (Bibliotheca 2.5.11, trans. J.G. Frazer)

## Funeral Rites

### The Necessity of Burial

The dead require burial to enter the underworld. [Patroclus](../heroes/patroclus.md)'s ghost appears to [Achilles](../heroes/achilles.md) and begs: "Bury me with all speed, that I pass the gates of Hades. Far off the spirits banish me, the phantoms of men outworn, nor suffer me to mingle with them beyond the River, but vainly I wander along the wide-gated dwelling of Hades."[^il23-patroclus] The unburied dead are explicitly denied entry to the afterlife — they can see it but cannot cross.

The obligation to bury the dead is strong enough to override political authority. In Sophocles' [Antigone](../sources/sophocles-antigone.md), [Creon](../heroes/creon.md) decrees that Polyneices shall lie unburied — "a feast of flesh for keen-eyed carrion birds" — while [Eteocles](../heroes/eteocles.md) receives full honours. [Antigone](../heroes/antigone.md) defies the edict: "I, I will bury this my brother's corse and risk your wrath." The play dramatises the collision between human law and the obligations owed to the dead.[^soph-ant]

[^il23-patroclus]: "Bury me with all speed, that I pass the gates of Hades. Far off the spirits banish me, the phantoms of men outworn, nor suffer me to mingle with them beyond the River, but vainly I wander along the wide-gated dwelling of Hades" (Iliad 23.81-86, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^soph-ant]: Antigone 28-36. "I, I will bury this my brother's corse and risk your wrath."

### Funeral Games

Funeral games honour the dead through competitive display. The sources record several foundations:

- [Achilles](../heroes/achilles.md) holds games for [Patroclus](../heroes/patroclus.md) (Iliad 23), featuring chariot races, boxing, wrestling, and more
- [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md) organises games for Achilles, providing prizes "in the midst of the lists for the champions of the Achaeans"[^od24-games]
- [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) founds the Pythian Games as funeral games for Python, placing "Python's bones in a cauldron, deposited them in his temple, and instituted funeral games for him which are called Pythian"[^hyg-pythian]
- The Nemean Games are founded for the infant Opheltes (Archemorus), killed by a serpent during the march of the [Seven Against Thebes](../events/seven-against-thebes.md)[^hyg-nemean]

[^od24-games]: Odyssey 24.85-92. Thetis provided prizes for Achilles' funeral games.
[^hyg-pythian]: "Apollo put Python's bones in a cauldron, deposited them in his temple, and instituted funeral games for him which are called Pythian" (Fabulae §140, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-nemean]: "They established funeral games in honour of the boy. They take place every fifth year, and the victors receive a wreath of parsley" (Fabulae §74, trans. Mary Grant)

## Purification

Blood guilt requires ritual cleansing. In the [Argonautica](../sources/argonautica.md), [Circe](../deities/circe.md) purifies [Jason](../heroes/jason.md) and [Medea](../heroes/medea.md) for the murder of Apsyrtus: "she held above their heads the young of a sow whose dugs yet swelled from the fruit of the womb, and, severing its neck, sprinkled their hands with the blood." She then offered "atonement-cakes without wine" to Zeus "the Cleanser" (Zeus Catharsius) and to the [Erinyes](../creatures/erinyes.md).[^arg-purify]

[Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) was initiated into the Eleusinian Mysteries "after being cleansed of the slaughter of the centaurs" — purification was a prerequisite for sacred initiation.[^apd-herc-eleusis] The [Danaids](../heroes/danaids.md) were purified by [Athena](../deities/athena.md) and [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md) "at the command of Zeus" after murdering their husbands.[^apd-danaids]

[^arg-purify]: "She held above their heads the young of a sow whose dugs yet swelled from the fruit of the womb, and, severing its neck, sprinkled their hands with the blood... Circe, standing by the hearth, kept burning atonement-cakes without wine, praying the while that she might stay from their wrath the terrible Furies, and that Zeus himself might be propitious" (Argonautica 4.702-716, trans. R.C. Seaton)
[^apd-herc-eleusis]: Bibliotheca 2.5.12. Heracles initiated at Eleusis after purification.
[^apd-danaids]: "Athena and Hermes purified them at the command of Zeus" (Bibliotheca 2.1.5, trans. J.G. Frazer)

## The Mysteries

### Eleusis

[Demeter](../deities/demeter.md) herself founded the Eleusinian Mysteries after the return of [Persephone](../deities/persephone.md): she "showed the conduct of her rites and taught them all her mysteries, to Triptolemus and Polyxeinus and Diocles also, — awful mysteries which no one may in any way transgress or pry into or utter, for deep awe of the gods checks the voice."[^hd-mysteries] The content of the rites is not described in any source — only their establishment and the promise that "happy is he among men upon earth who has seen these mysteries."

[^hd-mysteries]: "She showed the conduct of her rites and taught them all her mysteries, to Triptolemus and Polyxeinus and Diocles also, — awful mysteries which no one may in any way transgress or pry into or utter, for deep awe of the gods checks the voice. Happy is he among men upon earth who has seen these mysteries" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 473-480, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

### Bacchic Rites

[Dionysus](../deities/dionysus.md)' worship is described most fully in the [Bacchae](../sources/euripides-bacchae.md). Worshippers wear fawnskins girded with serpents and carry ivy-clad thyrsi. The earth under their feet "flows with milk, and flows with wine, and flows with the nectar of bees." The rites include omophagia — the raw eating of flesh — and ecstatic mountain dancing.[^eur-bac] Dionysus himself was "purified by [Rhea](../deities/rhea.md) in Phrygia" and learned his rites of initiation there, connecting Bacchic worship to the cult of the Great Mother.[^apd-dion]

[^eur-bac]: "The earth flows with milk, and flows with wine, and flows with the nectar of bees; and the smoke is as of Syrian frankincense" (Bacchae ~142-144). Fawnskins, serpents, thyrsi, and omophagia described at Bacchae ~100-167.
[^apd-dion]: "Purified by Rhea, he learned the rites of initiation and received from her his costume and set out" (Bibliotheca 3.5.1, trans. J.G. Frazer)

## The Oath by Styx

The gods' own form of binding ritual. [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) appointed [Styx](../deities/styx.md) "to be the great oath of the gods" in honour of her early support during the [Titanomachy](../events/titanomachy.md). Any god who swears falsely by her water "lies breathless until a full year is completed, and never comes near to taste ambrosia and nectar." After that year, "another penance and an harder follows... for nine years he is cut off from the eternal gods."[^theog-styx]

[Iris](../deities/iris.md) carries the water of Styx in a golden jug for oath-taking. [Calypso](../deities/calypso.md) swears by Styx to [Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md): "Let earth be now witness hereto, and the wide heaven above, and that falling water of the Styx, the greatest oath and the most terrible to the blessed gods."[^od5-styx] The [Erinyes](../creatures/erinyes.md) enforce oaths among mortals: "Be Zeus before all witness, highest and best of the gods, and Earth, and Sun, and Erinyes, who under earth take vengeance upon men, whosoever forsweareth himself."[^il19-oath]

[^theog-styx]: "Whoever of the deathless gods that hold the peaks of snowy Olympus pours a libation of her water is forsworn, lies breathless until a full year is completed, and never comes near to taste ambrosia and nectar... For nine years he is cut off from the eternal gods" (Theogony 793-804, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^od5-styx]: "Let earth be now witness hereto, and the wide heaven above, and that falling water of the Styx, the greatest oath and the most terrible to the blessed gods" (Odyssey 5.184-187)
[^il19-oath]: "Be Zeus before all witness, highest and best of the gods, and Earth, and Sun, and Erinyes, who under earth take vengeance upon men, whosoever forsweareth himself" (Iliad 19.254-256, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

## Sacrifice and the Divine Economy

Across the sources, a consistent picture emerges: the gods need — or at least expect — worship, and the relationship between divine and mortal operates through exchange. Zeus praises [Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md) as one who "beyond all men hath done sacrifice to the deathless gods."[^od1-odysseus] [Hecate](../deities/hecate.md) responds "whenever any one of men on earth offers rich sacrifices and prays for favour according to custom."[^theog-hecate] [Ananke](ananke.md) (Necessity) alone stands outside this system: "neither to the altars nor to the image of this Goddess alone, is it lawful to approach, she hears not victims."[^alc-ananke]

[^od1-odysseus]: Odyssey 1.65-67. Zeus acknowledges Odysseus's piety in sacrifice.
[^theog-hecate]: "Whenever any one of men on earth offers rich sacrifices and prays for favour according to custom, he calls on Hecate" (Theogony 416-418)
[^alc-ananke]: "Neither to the altars nor to the image of this Goddess alone, is it lawful to approach, she hears not victims" (Alcestis ~965-970)
