# Justice (Dike)

## Overview

**Justice** (Δίκη, Dike) in Greek mythology operates both as a personified goddess and as a central moral principle enforced by the gods, particularly [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md).

## Dike as a Goddess

Dike is one of the [Horae](../deities/groups/horae.md) (Hours), daughter of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) and [Themis](../deities/themis.md). In [Works and Days](../sources/works-and-days.md), she is "virgin Justice, the daughter of Zeus, who is honoured and reverenced among the gods who dwell on Olympus, and whenever anyone hurts her with lying slander, she sits beside her father, Zeus the son of Cronos, and tells him of men's wicked heart."[^wd-justice]

She is also depicted being physically dragged: "There is a noise when Justice is being dragged in the way where those who devour bribes and give sentence with crooked judgements, take her. And she, wrapped in mist, follows to the city and haunts of the people, weeping, and bringing mischief to men."[^wd-dragged]

[^wd-justice]: "And there is virgin Justice, the daughter of Zeus, who is honoured and reverenced among the gods who dwell on Olympus, and whenever anyone hurts her with lying slander, she sits beside her father, Zeus the son of Cronos, and tells him of men's wicked heart" (Works and Days 256-260, trans.

## Justice as a Theme

Questions of justice pervade the mythological sources:

- **The Oresteia** ([Aeschylus](../sources/aeschylus-agamemnon.md)): The entire trilogy traces justice from blood-vengeance ([Clytemnestra](../heroes/clytemnestra.md) kills [Agamemnon](../heroes/agamemnon.md), [Orestes](../heroes/orestes.md) kills Clytemnestra) to the establishment of trial by jury at the Areopagus in the [Eumenides](../sources/aeschylus-eumenides.md).
- **Hecuba** ([Euripides](../sources/euripides-hecuba.md)): Whether extreme suffering justifies savage revenge — [Hecuba](../heroes/hecuba.md) blinds Polymestor for murdering her son, and [Agamemnon](../heroes/agamemnon.md) endorses her vengeance.
- **Works and Days** ([Hesiod](../sources/works-and-days.md)): The just city prospers while the unjust city is destroyed — justice as the foundation of civilization.
