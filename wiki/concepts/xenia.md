# Xenia (Guest-Friendship)

## Overview

**Xenia** (ξενία) is the ancient Greek concept of hospitality and the reciprocal relationship between host and guest. It is one of the most important social and religious obligations in the mythological sources, protected by [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) in his role as Zeus Xenios (protector of strangers). Violation of xenia is consistently treated as one of the gravest offenses, often triggering divine punishment.

## Zeus as Protector of Strangers

The [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) repeatedly affirms Zeus's role as guarantor of xenia. Nausicaa instructs her handmaidens to care for the shipwrecked [Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md): "all strangers and beggars are from Zeus, and a little gift is dear."[^od6-nausicaa]

The swineherd Eumaeus echoes this when receiving the disguised Odysseus: "it were an impious thing for me to slight a stranger, even if there came a meaner man than thou; for from Zeus are all strangers and beggars."[^od14-eumaeus]

[^od6-nausicaa]: "all strangers and beggars are from Zeus, and a little gift is dear. So, my maidens, give the stranger meat and drink" (Odyssey 6.207-210, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od14-eumaeus]: "it were an impious thing for me to slight a stranger, even if there came a meaner man than thou; for from Zeus are all strangers and beggars; and a little gift from such as we, is dear" (Odyssey 14.56-59, trans. Butcher and Lang)

## Examples in the Sources

### Positive Examples

- **Eumaeus and Odysseus** ([Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) 14): Despite being a swineherd of modest means, Eumaeus offers the disguised Odysseus food, shelter, and his own cloak — the ideal of xenia practised by even the lowliest.
- **Nausicaa and Odysseus** ([Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) 6): Nausicaa finds a shipwrecked stranger and provides bathing, clothing, food, and an escort to the city, citing Zeus's protection of strangers.
- **Admetus and [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md)** ([Euripides, Alcestis](../sources/euripides-alcestis.md)): Admetus conceals his wife's death to avoid turning away a guest — an extreme case of hospitality overriding personal grief.
- **Diomedes and Glaucus** ([Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) 6): Two warriors discover their grandfathers were guest-friends and refuse to fight each other, exchanging armour instead. "Therefore now am I to thee a dear guest-friend in midmost Argos."[^il6-guestfriend]

[^il6-guestfriend]: "Therefore now am I to thee a dear guest-friend in midmost Argos, and thou in Lykia... So let us shun each other's spears" (Iliad 6.224-226, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

### Violations

- **The Suitors** ([Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md)): The suitors of [Penelope](../heroes/penelope.md) abuse Odysseus's household, consuming his wealth without reciprocity — a systematic violation of xenia that justifies their slaughter.
- **Polymestor** ([Euripides, Hecuba](../sources/euripides-hecuba.md)): The Thracian king murders his guest Polydorus for gold, prompting [Hecuba](../heroes/hecuba.md)'s cry: "Where are the laws of hospitality? O most accurst of men!"[^eur-hec-xenia]
- **[Paris](../heroes/paris.md)** ([Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md)): Paris violates the hospitality of [Menelaus](../heroes/menelaus.md) by abducting [Helen](../heroes/helen.md), triggering the [Trojan War](../events/trojan-war.md).
- **The [Cyclops](../creatures/cyclopes.md)** ([Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) 9): Polyphemus devours his guests instead of hosting them, representing the ultimate inversion of xenia.

[^eur-hec-xenia]: "Where are the laws of hospitality? O most accurst of men!" (Hecuba 714-720, trans. T.A. Buckley)

## The Obligation's Components

As shown across the sources, xenia involved:
- **Welcoming strangers** without first asking their identity (the host feeds and shelters the guest before asking who they are)
- **Gift exchange** between host and guest
- **Reciprocity** — a guest-friendship once established binds future generations
- **Divine sanction** — Zeus punishes violators
