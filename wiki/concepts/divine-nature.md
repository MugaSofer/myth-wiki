## Overview

The gods of Greek mythology are not abstract spirits. They have bodies, blood, food, and homes. But their bodies are made of different substance than mortal flesh, their blood is not blood, and their food is not food. The sources are remarkably specific about what separates the divine from the mortal: **ichor** instead of blood, **ambrosia and nectar** instead of bread and wine, **agelessness** alongside immortality, and a radiant physicality that mortals can perceive only partially and at great risk. These are not metaphors — they are the mechanics of divinity as the texts describe them.

## Ichor

The definitive passage on divine blood comes in [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book V, when [Diomedes](../heroes/diomedes.md) wounds [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md). What flows from the wound is not blood but ichor:

> "the goddess's immortal blood, such ichor as floweth in the blessed gods; for they eat no bread neither drink they gleaming wine, wherefore they are bloodless and are named immortals."[^il5-ichor]

This is Homer's only direct explanation of divine physiology, and it links three facts together: the gods have ichor instead of blood *because* they do not eat bread or drink wine, and they are called immortals *because* they are bloodless. The implication is that mortal blood — produced by mortal food — is itself the medium of death. Divine ichor is something different: a substance that sustains without decay.

The only other appearance of ichor in the sources is in the [Argonautica](../sources/argonautica.md), where the bronze giant [Talos](../creatures/talos.md) bleeds ichor when his ankle is grazed: "the ichor gushed forth like melted lead."[^arg4-ichor] Talos is not a god but "of the stock of bronze, of the men sprung from ash-trees, the last left among the sons of the gods" — suggesting that ichor was not unique to the Olympians but belonged to an older, semi-divine order of beings.

## Ambrosia and Nectar

The gods sustain themselves on ambrosia (food) and nectar (drink). The newborn [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) was not nursed by his mother Leto but fed directly with divine substance: "[Themis](../deities/themis.md) duly poured nectar and ambrosia with her immortal hands."[^hh3-nectar]

Ambrosia serves multiple functions beyond nutrition:

- **Cosmetic.** [Hera](../deities/hera.md) anoints herself "with olive oil, ambrosial, soft, and of a sweet savour" before seducing Zeus.[^il14-ambrosia]
- **Preservative.** [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) anoints [Sarpedon](../heroes/sarpedon.md)'s corpse "with ambrosia, and clad him in garments that wax not old" to preserve his body.[^il16-sarpedon]
- **Transformative.** In the apotheosis of [Aeneas](../heroes/aeneas.md), [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md) "touched his face with sweetest nectar and ambrosia mixt, thereby transforming him into a god."[^met-aeneas]

The inverse also holds: to be cut off from ambrosia is the worst punishment the gods can suffer. Any god who swears falsely by [Styx](../deities/styx.md) "never comes near to taste ambrosia and nectar, but lies spiritless and voiceless on a strewn bed: and a heavy trance overshadows him" for a full year, followed by nine years of exile from divine society.[^theog-styx] When [Demeter](../deities/demeter.md) mourns [Persephone](../deities/persephone.md), she "never tasted ambrosia and the sweet draught of nectar" — her grief expressed through voluntary deprivation of divine sustenance.[^hd-demeter]

## Agelessness and Immortality

Immortality in the sources means more than not dying — it means not aging. The standard formula is "ageless and immortal." [Calypso](../deities/calypso.md) offers [Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md) both: she would "make him to know not death nor age for all my days."[^od7-calypso] [Sarpedon](../heroes/sarpedon.md)'s great speech in [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book XII defines mortality by this double absence: "if once escaped from this battle we were for ever to be ageless and immortal, neither would I fight myself in the foremost ranks."[^il12-sarpedon]

The horror of separating the two is demonstrated by the story of Tithonus. [Eos](../deities/eos.md) asked [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) to grant him immortality but forgot to ask for eternal youth. "When loathsome old age pressed full upon him, and he could not move nor lift his limbs... she laid him in a room and put to the shining doors. There he babbles endlessly, and no more has strength at all."[^hh5-tithonus] Immortality without agelessness is not a gift but a prison.

## Divine Vulnerability

The gods can be hurt. This is one of the most striking features of Homer's theology — the immortals are not invulnerable.

[Dione](../deities/dione.md), comforting the wounded [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md), lists the precedents. [Ares](../deities/ares.md) was "bound in a strong prison-house" by the mortals Otos and Ephialtes for thirteen months, "and might Ares insatiate of battle have perished, but that the step-mother of Aloeus' sons, fair Eëriboia, gave tidings to [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md), and he stole away Ares, already pining."[^il5-ares-bound] [Hera](../deities/hera.md) was wounded by [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) "with a three-barbed arrow." [Hades](../deities/hades.md) was shot by Heracles "in Pylos amid the dead."[^il5-dione]

When Diomedes wounds Ares later in Book V, the god "bellowed loud as nine thousand warriors or ten thousand cry in battle."[^il5-ares-bellow] In Book XXI, [Athena](../deities/athena.md) fells Ares with a boundary stone and he covers "seven roods" in his fall.

Yet the gods cannot die. They suffer, bleed ichor, bellow in pain, and flee — but they recover. The distinction between divine vulnerability and mortal vulnerability is not that gods feel no pain, but that pain does not lead to death. This makes their occasional cowardice (Ares fleeing Diomedes, Aphrodite fleeing to her mother's lap) more comprehensible: they can experience suffering without the dignity of risking their existence.

## Divine Radiance and True Form

When gods reveal their true form, the result is overwhelming. The sources describe a consistent set of physical changes: increased height, blazing light, fragrance, and an effect on the surrounding environment.

[Demeter](../deities/demeter.md) at Eleusis: "the goddess changed her stature and her looks, thrusting old age away from her: beauty spread round about her and a lovely fragrance was wafted from her sweet-smelling robes, and from the divine body of the goddess a light shone afar, while golden tresses spread down over her shoulders, so that the strong house was filled with brightness as with lightning."[^hd-reveal]

[Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md) to Anchises: "her head reached to the well-hewn roof-tree; from her cheeks shone unearthly beauty such as belongs to rich-crowned Cytherea."[^hh5-reveal] In the [Aeneid](../sources/aeneid.md), when she turns away from [Aeneas](../heroes/aeneas.md): "her neck shone roseate, her immortal tresses breathed the fragrance of deity; her raiment fell flowing down to her feet, and the godhead was manifest in her tread."[^aen-aphrodite]

[Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) at Crisa: "like a star at noonday, the lord, far-working Apollo, leaped from the ship: flashes of fire flew from him thick and their brightness reached to heaven."[^hh3-apollo]

The mortal response to divine revelation is fear. Anchises, confronted by Aphrodite's true form, cries out: "he who lies with a deathless goddess is no hale man afterwards."[^hh5-anchises] The implication, repeated across the sources, is that full divine presence is dangerous to mortals — a hazard of proximity, like standing too close to a fire.

## Disguise

Because their true form is overwhelming, gods routinely appear to mortals in disguise. [Athena](../deities/athena.md) alone takes at least a dozen mortal forms across the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) and [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md): Mentes, Mentor, Deiphobus, Laodokos, a young maiden, an old herdsman. [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) appears as the seer Calchas, as Thoas, and as an old man. [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) takes the forms of Asios, Mentes, and Periphas.

Mortals sometimes see through divine disguise — but only partially. [Helen](../heroes/helen.md) recognises [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md) disguised as a woolcomber by "the fair neck and lovely breast and sparkling eyes of the goddess."[^il3-helen] Aias recognises [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) by his gait: "easily I knew the tokens of his feet and knees as he turned away, and the gods are easy to discern."[^il13-aias]

But direct divine revelation remains selective. When Athena appears to [Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md) outside the swineherd's hut, his son [Telemachus](../heroes/telemachus.md) cannot see her, "for the gods in no wise appear visibly to all."[^od16-invisible] Divinity is not simply hidden by disguise — it is selectively disclosed.

## Apotheosis: Crossing the Boundary

A few mortals cross the boundary from mortal to divine. The process described in the sources involves stripping away mortality — literally removing the mortal substance from the body.

[Demeter](../deities/demeter.md) attempted to immortalise the infant Demophon by setting "the babe of nights on the fire" to "strip off its mortal flesh." She was interrupted, and the child was consumed.[^apd-demophon]

[Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md)' apotheosis came through fire as well. As his funeral pyre burned, "a cloud passed under Hercules and with a peal of thunder wafted him up to heaven. Thereafter he obtained immortality."[^apd-heracles] The [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md) confirms the result: he "lives amongst the undying gods, untroubled and unageing all his days."[^theog-heracles]

For [Aeneas](../heroes/aeneas.md), the process is described most explicitly in the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md): Aphrodite "with flowing waters washed from her Aeneas every mortal part, and sprinkled him, so that the essential part of immortality remained alone, and she anointed him, thus purified, with heavenly essence, and she touched his face with sweetest nectar and ambrosia mixt, thereby transforming him into a god."[^met-aeneas]

The pattern is consistent: mortality is a physical substance that must be removed — by fire, by water, by divine anointing — for the immortal essence beneath to emerge. Apotheosis is not a reward conferred from outside but a *revelation* of what was always present.
