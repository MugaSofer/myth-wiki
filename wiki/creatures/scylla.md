## Overview

**Scylla** is a monstrous immortal creature who dwells in a cave high on a cliff in a narrow strait, opposite the whirlpool Charybdis. She is "no mortal, but an immortal plague, dread, grievous, and fierce, and not to be fought with; and against her there is no defence; flight is the bravest way."[^od-immortal] Her mother is Crataiis, "which bore her for a bane to mortals."[^od-mother] In the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md), [Circe](../deities/circe.md) warns Odysseus of her, and Scylla snatches six of his men as his ship passes through the strait.

[^od-immortal]: "no mortal, but an immortal plague, dread, grievous, and fierce, and not to be fought with; and against her there is no defence; flight is the bravest way" (Odyssey XII.6643-6645, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od-mother]: "mother of Scylla, which bore her for a bane to mortals" (Odyssey XII.6649-6650, trans. Butcher and Lang)

## Appearance

[Circe](../deities/circe.md) describes Scylla in detail. Her voice is deceptively slight — "no greater than the voice of a new-born whelp" — yet she is "a dreadful monster... nor would any look on her gladly, not if it were a god that met her."[^od-voice] She has twelve dangling feet, six exceedingly long necks, and on each neck a hideous head with "three rows of teeth set thick and close, full of black death."[^od-body] She is sunk to her middle in her hollow cave, but stretches her heads forth from the gulf to fish "for dolphins or sea-dogs, or whatso greater beast she may anywhere take, whereof the deep-voiced Amphitrite feeds countless flocks."[^od-fishing] No sailors pass her unscathed: "with each head she carries off a man, whom she hath snatched from out the dark-prowed ship."[^od-snatching]

[^od-voice]: "Her voice indeed is no greater than the voice of a new-born whelp, but a dreadful monster is she, nor would any look on her gladly, not if it were a god that met her" (Odyssey XII.6613-6615, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od-body]: "Verily she hath twelve feet all dangling down; and six necks exceeding long, and on each a hideous head, and therein three rows of teeth set thick and close, full of black death" (Odyssey XII.6615-6618, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od-fishing]: "Up to her middle is she sunk far down in the hollow cave, but forth she holds her heads from the dreadful gulf, and there she fishes, swooping round the rock, for dolphins or sea-dogs, or whatso greater beast she may anywhere take, whereof the deep-voiced Amphitrite feeds countless flocks" (Odyssey XII.6618-6622, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od-snatching]: "Thereby no sailors boast that they have fled scatheless ever with their ship, for with each head she carries off a man, whom she hath snatched from out the dark-prowed ship" (Odyssey XII.6622-6623, trans. Butcher and Lang)

## In the Odyssey

### Circe's Warning

[Circe](../deities/circe.md) describes the strait with its two cliffs. On one dwells Scylla in her cave; on the other is Charybdis (see below). Circe counsels Odysseus to hug Scylla's cliff rather than risk Charybdis, accepting the loss of six men over the loss of the entire ship. She declares Scylla immortal and unassailable — "not to be fought with" — and names flight as the only defence.[^od-immortal] She advises Odysseus to call upon Crataiis, Scylla's mother, to restrain her daughter from a second strike.[^od-mother]

### The Passage

As Odysseus's ship enters the strait, the crew stares in terror at Charybdis while Scylla snatches six men from the deck — "the hardiest of their hands and the chief in might."[^od-six] Odysseus compares the scene to a fisherman on a jutting rock: just as a fisher with a long rod hauls fish gasping from the sea, so Scylla swings his men aloft to devour them at the entrance of her cave.[^od-simile] They cry out, stretching their hands toward Odysseus in their death agony. He declares it "the most pitiful thing was this that mine eyes have seen of all my travail in searching out the paths of the sea."[^od-pitiful]

[^od-pitiful]: "the most pitiful thing was this that mine eyes have seen of all my travail in searching out the paths of the sea" (Odyssey XII.6775-6777, trans. Butcher and Lang)

### Charybdis

Charybdis dwells on the cliff opposite Scylla. She is a whirlpool of terrible power: "mighty Charybdis sucks down black water, for thrice a day she spouts it forth, and thrice a day she sucks it down in terrible wise."[^od-charybdis] [Circe](../deities/circe.md) warns that not even [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md), "the Earth-Shaker," could save a man caught in her pull.[^od-poseidon] On the cliff above her grows "a great fig-tree... in fullest leaf."[^od-fig]

Odysseus encounters Charybdis twice. On the first passage through the strait, he steers toward Scylla's side on [Circe](../deities/circe.md)'s advice and loses six men to Scylla rather than risk the whole ship in the whirlpool.

On the second encounter, after the destruction of his ship by [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md)'s thunderbolt, Odysseus drifts back to the strait alone on wreckage. As Charybdis sucks down the timbers of his ship, he clings to the great fig-tree above her, hanging "like a bat" and waiting for her to spew the timbers back.[^od-bat] When she finally disgorges the mast and keel, he drops down, straddles them, and paddles away with his hands.[^od-escape]

## In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md)

### Scylla the Maiden (13.730-749)

Before her transformation, Scylla was a beautiful maiden courted by many suitors, "but she repulsed them." Because she was "so much beloved by all the Nereids," she confided in the sea-nymphs, telling them "how she escaped from the love-stricken youths."[^met-scy-maiden] It was during one such conversation that Galatea told her the story of [Polyphemus](cyclopes.md) and Acis.

### Glaucus's Pursuit (13.898-968)

The sea-god Glaucus, newly transformed from a mortal fisherman, saw Scylla on the shore and swam toward her. She fled and "climbed to a mountain top above the sea," standing there "quite secure" and "doubtful whether he might be a god or monster." She "wondered at his flowing hair which covered his broad shoulders and his back — and marvelled at the color of his skin and at his waist merged into a twisted fish."[^met-scy-glaucus]

Glaucus pleaded his case — he was "no monster" but "a god of waters" — telling how he had been transformed by eating a magical herb. But Scylla "arose and left the god," and Glaucus, "provoked at his repulse — enraged, he hastened to the marvellous court of [Circe](../deities/circe.md), well known daughter of the Sun."[^met-scy-rejected]

### Circe's Poison (14.1-74)

[Circe](../deities/circe.md) offered herself to Glaucus instead, but he refused: "The trees will sooner grow in ocean waves, the sea-weed sooner grow on mountain tops, than I shall change my love for graceful Scylla." Circe, unable to harm the god she loved, "turned her wrath upon the one preferred."[^met-scy-circe]

She "bruised immediately the many herbs most infamous for horrid juices," mixed them with incantations from [Hecate](../deities/hecate.md), then walked across the sea to Scylla's favorite bathing inlet. There she "infected it before that hour, polluting it with monster-breeding drugs. She sprinkled juices over it, distilled from an obnoxious root, and thrice times nine she muttered over it with magic lips."[^met-scy-poison]

"Scylla came there and waded in waist deep, then saw her loins defiled with barking shapes. Believing they could be no part of her, she ran and tried to drive them back and feared the boisterous canine jaws. But what she fled she carried with her." She found "Cerberian jaws instead" of her legs and feet: "She rises from a rage of dogs, and shaggy backs encircle her shortened loins."[^met-scy-transform]

Glaucus "wept" and "fled the embrace of Circe and her hostile power of herbs." Scylla, "for hate of Circe, she robbed Ulysses of his men" when his ship passed. She was eventually "changed beforehand to a rock which to this day reveals a craggy rim. And even the rock awakes the sailors' dread."[^met-scy-rock]

[^met-scy-maiden]: "she repulsed them; and, because she was so much beloved by all the Nereids, she sought these nymphs and used to tell how she escaped from the love-stricken youths" (Metamorphoses 13.740-744, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-scy-glaucus]: "doubtful whether he might be a god or monster, wondered at his flowing hair which covered his broad shoulders and his back — and marvelled at the color of his skin and at his waist merged into a twisted fish" (Metamorphoses 13.910-914, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-scy-rejected]: "provoked at his repulse — enraged, he hastened to the marvellous court of Circe, well known daughter of the Sun" (Metamorphoses 13.966-968, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-scy-circe]: "The trees will sooner grow in ocean waves, the sea-weed sooner grow on mountain tops, than I shall change my love for graceful Scylla" (Metamorphoses 14.37-39, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-scy-poison]: "She sprinkled juices over it, distilled from an obnoxious root, and thrice times nine she muttered over it with magic lips, her most mysterious charm involved in words of strangest import and of dubious thought" (Metamorphoses 14.56-62, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-scy-transform]: "Scylla came there and waded in waist deep, then saw her loins defiled with barking shapes. Believing they could be no part of her, she ran and tried to drive them back and feared the boisterous canine jaws. But what she fled she carried with her... She rises from a rage of dogs, and shaggy backs encircle her shortened loins" (Metamorphoses 14.59-70, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-scy-rock]: "she would have wrecked the Trojan ships, if she had not been changed beforehand to a rock which to this day reveals a craggy rim. And even the rock awakes the sailors' dread" (Metamorphoses 14.72-74, trans. Brookes More)

## In the [Aeneid](../sources/aeneid.md)

### Helenus's Warning (3.420-432)

In the [Aeneid](../sources/aeneid.md), the seer Helenus warns [Aeneas](../heroes/aeneas.md) to avoid the strait of Scylla and Charybdis. His description of Scylla differs from the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md)'s six-headed monster: "Scylla lies prisoned in her cavern's blind recesses, thrusting forth her mouth and drawing ships upon the rocks. In front her face is human, and her breast fair as a maiden's to the waist down; behind she is a sea-dragon of monstrous frame, with dolphins' tails joined on her wolf-girt belly."[^aen-scy-desc] Helenus advises taking the long route around Sicily rather than risk her: "Better to track the goal of Trinacrian Pachynus, lingering and wheeling round through long spaces, than once catch sight of misshapen Scylla."[^aen-scy-avoid]

[^aen-scy-desc]: "Scylla lies prisoned in her cavern's blind recesses, thrusting forth her mouth and drawing ships upon the rocks. In front her face is human, and her breast fair as a maiden's to the waist down; behind she is a sea-dragon of monstrous frame, with dolphins' tails joined on her wolf-girt belly" (Aeneid 3.424-428, trans. J.W. Mackail)
[^aen-scy-avoid]: "Better to track the goal of Trinacrian Pachynus, lingering and wheeling round through long spaces, than once catch sight of misshapen Scylla deep in her dreary cavern" (Aeneid 3.429-432)

## Variant Parentage (Great Eoiae)

The Great Eoiae preserves a strikingly different parentage: "in the Great Eoiae Scylla is the daughter of Phoebus and Hecate."[^ge-parentage] This would make her the offspring of [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) and [Hecate](../deities/hecate.md) — a child of the sun-god and the goddess of crossroads and sorcery — rather than the daughter of the obscure Crataiis named in the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md).

[^ge-parentage]: "in the Great Eoiae Scylla is the daughter of Phoebus and Hecate" (Great Eoiae, Fragment 13, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
