## Overview

The **Minotaur** was a creature with the head of a bull and the body of a man, born from the union of [Pasiphae](../heroes/pasiphae.md), wife of [Minos](../heroes/minos.md), and a bull sent by [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md). It was confined in the Labyrinth built by [Daedalus](../heroes/daedalus.md) on [Crete](../places/crete.md), where it was fed on a tribute of Athenian youths until [Theseus](../heroes/theseus.md) killed it.

## Appearance

[Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) describes the Minotaur's form precisely: "He had the face of a bull, but the rest of him was human."[^apd-face] [Virgil](../sources/aeneid.md) calls it a "mingled breed and double issue," the "record of a shameful passion."[^aen-breed]

## Origin

### In the Bibliotheca

[Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) had given [Minos](../heroes/minos.md) a fine bull to sacrifice, but Minos kept it. "Angry at him for not sacrificing the bull, Poseidon made the animal savage, and contrived that Pasiphae should conceive a passion for it."[^apd-origin] [Daedalus](../heroes/daedalus.md), an exiled Athenian architect, assisted Pasiphae: "He constructed a wooden cow on wheels, took it, hollowed it out in the inside, sewed it up in the hide of a cow which he had skinned, and set it in the meadow in which the bull used to graze. Then he introduced Pasiphae into it; and the bull came and coupled with it, as if it were a real cow."[^apd-cow]

"And she gave birth to Asterius, who was called the Minotaur."[^apd-birth] Minos then "in compliance with certain oracles, shut him up and guarded him in the Labyrinth."[^apd-labyrinth]

### In the Fabulae

[Hyginus](../sources/hyginus.md) attributes Pasiphae's passion to a different divine grudge: "Pasiphae, daughter of Sol and wife of Minos, for several years did not make offerings to the goddess Venus. Because of this Venus inspired in her an unnatural love for a bull."[^hyg-pasiphae] Daedalus again assists — "for her he made a wooden heifer, and put in it the hide of a real heifer, and in this she lay with the bull. From this intercourse she bore the Minotaur, with bull's head but human body."[^hyg-birth]

"Then Daedalus made for the Minotaur a labyrinth with an undiscoverable exit in which it was confined."[^hyg-labyrinth]

### In the Metamorphoses

[Ovid](../sources/metamorphoses.md) alludes to the origin through [Ariadne](../heroes/ariadne.md)'s bitter words to [Theseus](../heroes/theseus.md): "That woman is a worthy mate for you who hid in wood deceived the raging bull, and bore to him the infamy of Crete."[^met-ariadne]

Ovid describes the Labyrinth itself in detail: Daedalus "planned of mazey wanderings that deceived the eyes, and labyrinthic passages involved. So sports the clear Maeander, in the fields of Phrygia winding doubtful; back and forth it meets itself... So Daedalus contrived innumerous paths, and windings vague, so intricate that he, the architect, hardly could retrace his steps."[^met-labyrinth]

## Variant Traditions

The sources disagree on the cause of Pasiphae's unnatural desire. Apollodorus attributes it to Poseidon's anger at Minos for failing to sacrifice the bull.[^apd-origin] Hyginus instead blames [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md) (Venus), saying Pasiphae had neglected her worship for several years.[^hyg-pasiphae]

## The Athenian Tribute

After [Minos](../heroes/minos.md) conquered [Athens](../places/athens.md), the Athenians were compelled to send a tribute of young people to feed the Minotaur. Apollodorus says the Athenians "should give Minos whatever satisfaction he might choose. And Minos ordered them to send seven youths and the same number of damsels without weapons to be fodder for the Minotaur."[^apd-tribute]

Hyginus gives the same detail: "he decreed, moreover, that each year they should send seven of their children as food for the Minotaur."[^hyg-tribute] Ovid confirms the Minotaur "devoured Athenian victims sent three seasons, nine years each."[^met-tribute]

## Death

[Theseus](../heroes/theseus.md) volunteered — or was chosen — to go as part of the tribute. Apollodorus says "he was numbered among those who were to be sent as the third tribute to the Minotaur; or, as some affirm, he offered himself voluntarily."[^apd-theseus-volunteer]

[Ariadne](../heroes/ariadne.md), daughter of Minos, fell in love with Theseus and helped him. She "besought Daedalus to disclose the way out of the labyrinth," and at Daedalus's suggestion "gave Theseus a clue when he went in; Theseus fastened it to the door, and, drawing it after him, entered in."[^apd-thread] He found "the Minotaur in the last part of the labyrinth" and "killed him by smiting him with his fists."[^apd-kill]

Hyginus's account is briefer: "When Theseus had entered and killed the Minotaur, by Ariadne's advice he got out by unwinding the thread."[^hyg-theseus]

## The Labyrinth

The Labyrinth was built by [Daedalus](../heroes/daedalus.md) to contain the Minotaur. Apollodorus describes it as "a chamber 'that with its tangled windings perplexed the outward way,'" where "many a winding turn shut off the secret outward way."[^apd-labyrinth-desc]

After Theseus escaped with Ariadne, "Minos shut up the guilty Daedalus in the labyrinth, along with his son Icarus."[^apd-daedalus-imprisoned] Daedalus and Icarus escaped by constructing wings.

[Virgil](../sources/aeneid.md) depicts the Labyrinth carved on the doors of [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md)'s temple at Cumae, alongside Pasiphae and the Minotaur — "the famous dwelling's laborious inextricable maze; but Daedalus, pitying the great love of the princess, himself unlocked the tangled treachery of the palace, guiding with the clue her lover's blind footsteps."[^aen-labyrinth] Elsewhere Virgil compares the Trojan Games to the Labyrinth: "as once of old, they say, the labyrinth in high Crete had a tangled path between blind walls, and a thousand ways of doubling treachery, where tokens to follow failed in the maze unmastered and irrecoverable."[^aen-games]

## In the Aeneid

[Virgil](../sources/aeneid.md) depicts the Minotaur's story carved on the temple doors at Cumae alongside [Daedalus](../heroes/daedalus.md)' flight — "the cruel love of the bull, the disguised stealth of Pasiphaë, and the mingled breed and double issue of the Minotaur, record of a shameful passion."[^aen-breed]
