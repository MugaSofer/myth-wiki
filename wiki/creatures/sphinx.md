## Overview

The **Sphinx** was a monster that plagued the city of Thebes. She was the offspring of [Echidna](echidna.md) and Orthus (the hound of Geryones).

## Mythology

The Sphinx is described as "the deadly Sphinx which destroyed the Cadmeans."[^theog-sphinx]

[^theog-sphinx]: "Echidna was subject in love to Orthus and brought forth the deadly Sphinx which destroyed the Cadmeans" (Theogony 326-327, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## In the Bibliotheca (3.5.8)

[Hera](../deities/hera.md) sent the Sphinx to [Thebes](../places/thebes.md). The Bibliotheca gives different parents from the Theogony: "whose mother was [Echidna](echidna.md) and her father [Typhon](typhoeus.md)."[^apd-sphinx-parents] She is described as having "the face of a woman, the breast and feet and tail of a lion, and the wings of a bird."[^apd-sphinx-form]

She sat on Mount Phicium and propounded a riddle she had learned from the [Muses](../deities/muses.md): "What is that which has one voice and yet becomes four-footed and two-footed and three-footed?" The Thebans possessed an oracle saying they would be rid of her when the riddle was solved, but those who failed were snatched and devoured. After many had perished, including Creon's son Haemon, [Oedipus](../heroes/oedipus.md) solved it: the answer was man — "as a babe he is four-footed, going on four limbs, as an adult he is two-footed, and as an old man he gets besides a third support in a staff." The Sphinx threw herself from the citadel.[^apd-sphinx-riddle]

[^apd-sphinx-parents]: "Hera sent the Sphinx, whose mother was Echidna and her father Typhon" (Bibliotheca 3.5.8, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-sphinx-form]: "she had the face of a woman, the breast and feet and tail of a lion, and the wings of a bird" (Bibliotheca 3.5.8, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-sphinx-riddle]: "Oedipus found the solution, declaring that the riddle of the Sphinx referred to man; for as a babe he is four-footed, going on four limbs, as an adult he is two-footed, and as an old man he gets besides a third support in a staff. So the Sphinx threw herself from the citadel" (Bibliotheca 3.5.8, trans. J.G. Frazer)

## In the Fabulae

The [Fabulae](../sources/hyginus.md) embeds the Sphinx story within the larger account of [Oedipus](../heroes/oedipus.md) (§67).

### Sending and Devastation

"After Laius' death, Creon, son of Menoeceus, ruled; in the meantime the Sphinx, offspring of Typhon, was sent into Boeotia, and was laying waste the fields of the Thebans."[^hyg-67-sent] This identifies the Sphinx as offspring of [Typhoeus](typhoeus.md) (Typhon) alone, without mentioning [Echidna](echidna.md).

### The Contest

The Sphinx "proposed a contest to Creon, that if anyone interpreted the riddle which she gave, she would depart, but that she would destroy whoever failed, and under no other circumstances would she leave the country."[^hyg-67-contest] This presents the riddle-contest as a formal agreement with Creon himself.

Creon "made a proclamation throughout Greece" promising "he would give the kingdom and his sister Jocasta in marriage to the person solving the riddle of the Sphinx."[^hyg-67-proclamation] The Fabulae emphasizes the political stakes: "Many came out of greed for the kingdom, and were devoured by the Sphinx."[^hyg-67-devoured]

### Defeat

"Oidipus, son of Laius, came and interpreted the riddle. The Sphinx leaped to her death."[^hyg-67-death] The Fabulae does not give the riddle itself or its solution, unlike the Bibliotheca.

[^hyg-67-sent]: "After Laius' death, Creon, son of Menoeceus, ruled; in the meantime the Sphinx, offspring of Typhon, was sent into Boeotia, and was laying waste the fields of the Thebans" (Fabulae §67, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-67-contest]: "She proposed a contest to Creon, that if anyone interpreted the riddle which she gave, she would depart, but that she would destroy whoever failed, and under no other circumstances would she leave the country" (Fabulae §67, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-67-proclamation]: "When the king heard this, he made a proclamation throughout Greece. He promised that he would give the kingdom and his sister Jocasta in marriage to the person solving the riddle of the Sphinx" (Fabulae §67, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-67-devoured]: "Many came out of greed for the kingdom, and were devoured by the Sphinx" (Fabulae §67, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-67-death]: "Oidipus, son of Laius, came and interpreted the riddle. The Sphinx leaped to her death" (Fabulae §67, trans. Mary Grant)
