## Overview

The **Sphinx** was a monster that plagued the city of Thebes. She was the offspring of [Echidna](echidna.md) and Orthus (the hound of Geryones).

## Mythology

The Sphinx is described as "the deadly Sphinx which destroyed the Cadmeans."[^theog-sphinx]

[^theog-sphinx]: "Echidna was subject in love to Orthus and brought forth the deadly Sphinx which destroyed the Cadmeans" (Theogony 326-327, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## In the Bibliotheca (3.5.8)

[Hera](../deities/hera.md) sent the Sphinx to [Thebes](../places/thebes.md). The Bibliotheca gives different parents from the Theogony: "whose mother was [Echidna](echidna.md) and her father [Typhon](typhoeus.md)."[^apd-sphinx-parents] She is described as having "the face of a woman, the breast and feet and tail of a lion, and the wings of a bird."[^apd-sphinx-form]

She sat on Mount Phicium and propounded a riddle she had learned from the [Muses](../deities/muses.md): "What is that which has one voice and yet becomes four-footed and two-footed and three-footed?" The Thebans possessed an oracle saying they would be rid of her when the riddle was solved, but those who failed were snatched and devoured. After many had perished, including Creon's son Haemon, [Oedipus](../heroes/oedipus.md) solved it: the answer was man — "as a babe he is four-footed, going on four limbs, as an adult he is two-footed, and as an old man he gets besides a third support in a staff." The Sphinx threw herself from the citadel.[^apd-sphinx-riddle]

[^apd-sphinx-parents]: "Hera sent the Sphinx, whose mother was Echidna and her father Typhon" (Bibliotheca 3.5.8, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-sphinx-form]: "she had the face of a woman, the breast and feet and tail of a lion, and the wings of a bird" (Bibliotheca 3.5.8, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-sphinx-riddle]: "Oedipus found the solution, declaring that the riddle of the Sphinx referred to man; for as a babe he is four-footed, going on four limbs, as an adult he is two-footed, and as an old man he gets besides a third support in a staff. So the Sphinx threw herself from the citadel" (Bibliotheca 3.5.8, trans. J.G. Frazer)
