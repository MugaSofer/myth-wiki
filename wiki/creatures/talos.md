## Overview

**Talos** is a bronze giant who guarded the island of [Crete](../places/crete.md) by circling it on foot three times each day and driving off unwanted ships with hurled rocks. He is described in the Argonautica as the last survivor of the race of bronze men sprung from ash-trees, and was given by [Cronos](../deities/cronos.md) to Europa as Crete's warder. His only vulnerability was a blood-red vein at his ankle, sealed by thin skin; when this was breached, his ichor — described as flowing out "like melted lead" — drained away and he fell. He was destroyed by [Medea](../heroes/medea.md) through sorcery during the return voyage of the [Argo](../objects/argo.md).

## In the Argonautica

### Origin and Nature

Apollonius places Talos among a now-vanished race: he was "of the stock of bronze, of the men sprung from ash-trees, the last left among the sons of the gods."[^arg4-origin] His maker or creator is not described; he was simply a gift from [Cronos](../deities/cronos.md) to Europa: "the son of Cronos gave him to Europa to be the warder of Crete and to stride round the island thrice a day with his feet of bronze."[^arg4-duty]

His body was otherwise entirely invulnerable: "in all the rest of his body and limbs was he fashioned of bronze and invulnerable; but beneath the sinew by his ankle was a blood-red vein; and this, with its issues of life and death, was covered by a thin skin."[^arg4-vein]

### Guardian of Crete

When the Argo approached Crete and attempted to put in at the roadstead of Dicte's haven, Talos drove them off: "as he broke off rocks from the hard cliff, stayed them from fastening hawsers to the shore."[^arg4-rocks] The crew, "outworn with toil, quickly backed their ship from the land in sore dismay."[^arg4-dismay]

### Medea's Defeat of Talos

[Medea](../heroes/medea.md) told the crew she alone could subdue the bronze man, whatever his frame, provided his life was not everlasting.[^arg4-medea-claim] She mounted the deck, holding the fold of her purple robe over her cheeks, and began her working:

> "with songs did she propitiate and invoke the Death-spirits, devourers of life, the swift hounds of Hades, who, hovering through all the air, swoop down on the living. Kneeling in supplication, thrice she called on them with songs, and thrice with prayers; and, shaping her soul to mischief, with her hostile glance she bewitched the eyes of Talos, the man of bronze; and her teeth gnashed bitter wrath against him, and she sent forth baneful phantoms in the frenzy of her rage."[^arg4-bewitch]

As Talos heaved rocks to drive the Argo away, he "grazed his ankle on a pointed crag; and the ichor gushed forth like melted lead; and not long thereafter did he stand towering on the jutting cliff."[^arg4-ichor]

### Death

Apollonius describes the fall of Talos through an extended simile:

> "even as some huge pine, high up on the mountains, which woodmen have left half hewn through by their sharp axes when they returned from the forest—at first it shivers in the wind by night, then at last snaps at the stump and crashes down; so Talos for a while stood on his tireless feet, swaying to and fro, when at last, all strengthless, fell with a mighty thud."[^arg4-fall]

For that night the heroes lay on Crete, and at dawn they built a shrine to Minoan Athena before departing.[^arg4-aftermath]

## In the Bibliotheca

[Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) gives a briefer account at Bibliotheca 1.9.26. He notes variant traditions about Talos's origins: "Some say that he was a man of the Brazen Race, others that he was given to Minos by [Hephaestus](../deities/hephaestus.md)." Apollodorus describes his vein differently — as "a single vein extending from his neck to his ankles," sealed by a bronze nail rather than thin skin. He also records variant accounts of his death: "either, as some say, she drove him mad by drugs, or, as others say, she promised to make him immortal and then drew out the nail, so that all the ichor gushed out and he died." The Argo's initial encounter is described simply: "when he saw the Argo standing inshore, he pelted it as usual with stones."[^apd-talos]

## Variant Traditions

The origin of Talos differs significantly between sources. The Argonautica makes him the last of the Bronze race of men, a gift from [Cronos](../deities/cronos.md) to Europa. The Bibliotheca offers two alternatives: a man of the Brazen Age, or a creation of [Hephaestus](../deities/hephaestus.md) given to [Minos](../heroes/minos.md). The anatomy of his vulnerability also differs: a blood-red vein sealed by thin skin at the ankle (Argonautica) versus a single vein from neck to ankle sealed by a bronze nail (Bibliotheca). The mechanism of his death similarly varies — Medea's hostile gaze and sorcery (Argonautica) versus drugs, or a false promise of immortality used to draw out the nail (Bibliotheca).
