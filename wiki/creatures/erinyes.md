## Overview

The **Erinyes** (the strong Erinyes) were born from the blood of [Uranus](../deities/uranus.md) that fell upon [Gaia](../deities/gaia.md) when [Cronos](../deities/cronos.md) castrated him.

## Birth

"All the bloody drops that gushed forth Earth received, and as the seasons moved round she bare the strong Erinyes and the great [Giants](giants.md) with gleaming armour, holding long spears in their hands and the Nymphs whom they call Meliae all over the boundless earth."[^theog-birth]

[^theog-birth]: "All the bloody drops that gushed forth Earth received, and as the seasons moved round she bare the strong Erinyes and the great Giants with gleaming armour, holding long spears in their hands and the Nymphs whom they call Meliae all over the boundless earth." (Theogony 183-187, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## In the Iliad

### Phoenix's Curse (Book IX)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book IX, Phoenix tells how his father Amyntor "called the dire Erinyes to look that never should any dear son sprung of my body sit upon my knees: and the gods fulfilled his curse, even Zeus of the underworld and dread [Persephone](../deities/persephone.md)."[^il9-phoenix]

### Althaia's Curse on Meleager (Book IX)

In the same book, Meleager's mother Althaia invokes them: "with her hands likewise beat instantly upon the fertile earth, calling on [Hades](../deities/hades.md) and dread [Persephone](../deities/persephone.md)... to bring her son to death; and Erinnys that walketh in darkness, whose heart knoweth not ruth, heard her from Erebos."[^il9-althaia]

The description "Erinnys that walketh in darkness, whose heart knoweth not ruth" is the most vivid characterization of them in any source processed so far.

[^il9-phoenix]: "he was sore angered with me... and called the dire Erinyes to look that never should any dear son sprung of my body sit upon my knees: and the gods fulfilled his curse, even Zeus of the underworld and dread Persephone" (Iliad IX.5338-5341, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il9-althaia]: "she, grieved for her brethren's death, prayed instantly to the gods, and with her hands likewise beat instantly upon the fertile earth, calling on Hades and dread Persephone, while she knelt upon her knees and made her bosom wet with tears, to bring her son to death; and Erinnys that walketh in darkness, whose heart knoweth not ruth, heard her from Erebos" (Iliad IX.5429-5434)
