## Overview

The **Erinyes** (the strong Erinyes) were born from the blood of [Uranus](../deities/uranus.md) that fell upon [Gaia](../deities/gaia.md) when [Cronos](../deities/cronos.md) castrated him.

## Birth

"All the bloody drops that gushed forth Earth received, and as the seasons moved round she bare the strong Erinyes and the great [Giants](giants.md) with gleaming armour, holding long spears in their hands and the Nymphs whom they call Meliae all over the boundless earth."[^theog-birth]

[^theog-birth]: "All the bloody drops that gushed forth Earth received, and as the seasons moved round she bare the strong Erinyes and the great Giants with gleaming armour, holding long spears in their hands and the Nymphs whom they call Meliae all over the boundless earth." (Theogony 183-187, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## In the Iliad

### Phoenix's Curse (Book IX)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book IX, Phoenix tells how his father Amyntor "called the dire Erinyes to look that never should any dear son sprung of my body sit upon my knees: and the gods fulfilled his curse, even Zeus of the underworld and dread [Persephone](../deities/persephone.md)."[^il9-phoenix]

### Althaia's Curse on Meleager (Book IX)

In the same book, Meleager's mother Althaia invokes them: "with her hands likewise beat instantly upon the fertile earth, calling on [Hades](../deities/hades.md) and dread [Persephone](../deities/persephone.md)... to bring her son to death; and Erinnys that walketh in darkness, whose heart knoweth not ruth, heard her from Erebos."[^il9-althaia]

The description "Erinnys that walketh in darkness, whose heart knoweth not ruth" is the most vivid characterization of them in any source processed so far.

[^il9-phoenix]: "he was sore angered with me... and called the dire Erinyes to look that never should any dear son sprung of my body sit upon my knees: and the gods fulfilled his curse, even Zeus of the underworld and dread Persephone" (Iliad 9.447-450, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il9-althaia]: "she, grieved for her brethren's death, prayed instantly to the gods, and with her hands likewise beat instantly upon the fertile earth, calling on Hades and dread Persephone, while she knelt upon her knees and made her bosom wet with tears, to bring her son to death; and Erinnys that walketh in darkness, whose heart knoweth not ruth, heard her from Erebos" (Iliad 9.550-555)

### Triple Role (Book XIX)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book XIX, the Erinyes appear in three distinct roles:

1. **As agents of madness**: Agamemnon blames "[Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) and Destiny and Erinys that walketh in the darkness, who put into my soul fierce madness on the day when in the assembly I, even I, bereft Achilles of his meed."[^il19-madness]

2. **As oath-enforcers**: In his oath, Agamemnon invokes "[Zeus](../deities/zeus.md)... and Earth, and Sun, and Erinyes, who under earth take vengeance upon men, whosoever forsweareth himself."[^il19-oath]

3. **As guardians of natural order**: When Achilles' horse Xanthos prophesies his death (given speech by [Hera](../deities/hera.md)), "the Erinyes stayed his voice" — enforcing the boundary between animal and human speech.[^il19-voice]

[^il19-madness]: "Zeus and Destiny and Erinys that walketh in the darkness, who put into my soul fierce madness on the day when in the assembly I, even I, bereft Achilles of his meed. What could I do? it is God who accomplisheth all" (Iliad 19.95-99, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il19-oath]: "Be Zeus before all witness, highest and best of the gods, and Earth, and Sun, and Erinyes, who under earth take vengeance upon men, whosoever forsweareth himself" (Iliad 19.254-256)
[^il19-voice]: "Now when he had thus spoken the Erinyes stayed his voice" (Iliad 19.410)

## In the Odyssey

### The Erinnys and Melampus (Book XV)

In [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) Book XV, within the Melampus digression, the Erinnys appears in singular form: Melampus was "suffering strong pains for the sake of the daughter of Neleus, and for the dread blindness of soul which the goddess, the Erinnys of the dolorous stroke, had laid on him."[^od15-melampus] The epithet "the Erinnys of the dolorous stroke" is notable — it uses the singular form, treating the Erinnys as a single goddess rather than a collective, and the phrase "of the dolorous stroke" adds a distinct characterisation alongside the Iliad's "that walketh in darkness, whose heart knoweth not ruth."

[^od15-melampus]: "suffering strong pains for the sake of the daughter of Neleus, and for the dread blindness of soul which the goddess, the Erinnys of the dolorous stroke, had laid on him" (Odyssey 15.244-245, trans. Butcher and Lang)

### The Daughters of Pandareus (Book XX)

In [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) Book XX, Penelope tells the myth of the daughters of Pandareus. After their parents were slain by the gods, the orphaned maidens were blessed by four goddesses: [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md) "cherished them with curds and sweet honey and delicious wine," [Hera](../deities/hera.md) gave them "beauty and wisdom beyond the lot of women," [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md) "dowered them with stature," and [Athena](../deities/athena.md) "taught them skill in all famous handiwork." But while Aphrodite was away on [Olympus](../places/olympus.md) seeking marriages for them, "the spirits of the storm snatched away these maidens, and gave them to be handmaids to the hateful Erinyes."[^od20-pandareus]

The passage is striking because the Erinyes receive the maidens as a kind of cosmic payment — despite the girls' innocence and the gods' own gifts. The storm spirits act as intermediaries, delivering the daughters not to death but to servitude under the Erinyes.

[^od20-pandareus]: "the spirits of the storm snatched away these maidens, and gave them to be handmaids to the hateful Erinyes" (Odyssey 20.74, trans. Butcher and Lang)

## In the Bibliotheca

Apollodorus names the individual [Erinyes](../creatures/erinyes.md) — a detail not found in any earlier source processed so far. When [Cronos](../deities/cronos.md) castrated [Uranus](../deities/uranus.md), "from the drops of the flowing blood were born Furies, to wit, Alecto, Tisiphone, and Megaera."[^apd-erinyes-names]

This is the first source to give the Erinyes their individual names. The [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md) calls them simply "the strong Erinyes"; the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) and [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) refer to them collectively or in the singular.

[^apd-erinyes-names]: "from the drops of the flowing blood were born Furies, to wit, Alecto, Tisiphone, and Megaera" (Bibliotheca 1.1.4, trans. Frazer)

## Appearance

The most detailed physical description of the Erinyes comes from Aeschylus' *Eumenides*. The Pythian priestess at [Delphi](../places/delphi.md) describes them as "wingless, black, and all their shape the eye's abomination to behold." She compares them unfavorably to both Gorgons and Harpies: "not like women they, but Gorgons rather; nay, that word is weak, nor may I match the Gorgons' shape with theirs!"[^eum-priestess] Their breath is fell and poisonous, and "from their eyes exude the damnèd drops of poisonous ire."[^eum-eyes]

In the *Libation-Bearers*, [Orestes](../heroes/orestes.md) sees them first as "Gorgon shapes" with "dusky robes" and "hair enwound—snakes coiled with snakes," dripping "black blood of hatred" from their eyes.[^lb-gorgons]

## Powers

The Erinyes are pursuers and punishers of those who shed kindred blood. They track their prey by the scent of blood: "like to some hound that hunts a wounded fawn, we snuff along the scent of dripping gore."[^eum-hound] They can drive mortals mad, as they do to Orestes. Their "binding song" can drain the life from a victim: "from thy living limbs I suck it out, red, clotted, gout by gout."[^eum-suck]

They declare themselves immune from the authority of the Olympian gods in matters of blood-guilt: "I hold this task—'tis mine, and not another's. The very gods on high, though they can silence and annul the prayers of those who on us cry, they may not strive with us."[^eum-immune]

## In Aeschylus' Libation-Bearers

At the end of the *[Libation-Bearers](../sources/aeschylus-libation-bearers.md)*, the Erinyes appear to [Orestes](../heroes/orestes.md) immediately after the matricide—visible only to him, not to the Chorus. They drive him to flee to [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md)'s shrine at [Delphi](../places/delphi.md).

## In Aeschylus' Eumenides

The *[Eumenides](../sources/aeschylus-eumenides.md)* is the Erinyes' central text. They appear as the Chorus and are on stage for nearly the entire play.

### Parentage and Office

The Furies identify themselves as "the children of eternal Night."[^eum-night] They describe their office as ordained by Fate: "Whosoe'er of mortals, made perverse and lawless, is stained with blood of kin, by his side are we, and hunt him ever onward, till to the Silent Land, the realm of death, he cometh."[^eum-office] They are excluded from the company of the Olympians—"a race by Zeus abhorred, blood-boltered, held unworthy of the council and converse of Heaven's lord"—but this exclusion only strengthens their resolve.[^eum-abhorred]

### The Pursuit of Orestes

The ghost of [Clytemnestra](../heroes/clytemnestra.md) rouses them from sleep at Delphi. They confront [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md), who drives them from his temple. They pursue Orestes across land and sea to Athens, "flying without wings, swift as a sail."[^eum-chase]

### The Argument Over Jurisdiction

The Furies argue that matricide is their domain by ancient right. When Apollo objects that they did not punish [Clytemnestra](../heroes/clytemnestra.md) for killing her husband, they reply: "She was not kin by blood to him she slew."[^eum-kin] This distinction—that the bond of blood between mother and child is unique and inviolable—is central to their case.

### The Trial and Transformation

At the trial on the [Areopagus](../places/areopagus.md), the Furies prosecute while Apollo defends. When the votes are tied and [Athena](../deities/athena.md) acquits Orestes, they rage: "Woe on you, younger gods! the ancient right ye have o'erridden, rent it from my hands."[^eum-woe] They threaten to blight Athens with pestilence and barrenness.

Athena patiently persuades them with the offer of an honoured shrine in Athens: "No house shall prosper without grace of thine."[^eum-prosper] She promises them worship, offerings, and the power to bless or curse the city's prosperity. The Furies accept and are transformed into the **Eumenides** ("Kindly Ones"). They bless Athens: "Scorching blight nor singèd air never blast thine olives fair!... Let the land, in season due, twice her waxing fruits renew."[^eum-bless] They are led in torchlit procession to their new underground shrine beneath the Areopagus.

## In Sophocles' Oedipus at Colonus

At [Colonus](../places/colonus.md), the Erinyes are worshipped as "the Maidens, Daughters of Darkness and mysterious Earth"—the Eumenides. Their sacred grove is the setting of the entire play, and [Oedipus](../heroes/oedipus.md) recognizes it as his fated resting place.[^soc-maidens]
