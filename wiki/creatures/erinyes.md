## Overview

## Birth

"All the bloody drops that gushed forth Earth received, and as the seasons moved round she bare the strong Erinyes and the great [Giants](giants.md) with gleaming armour, holding long spears in their hands and the Nymphs whom they call Meliae all over the boundless earth."[^theog-birth]
