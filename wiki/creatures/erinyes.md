## Overview

The **Erinyes** (the strong Erinyes) were born from the blood of [Uranus](../deities/uranus.md) that fell upon [Gaia](../deities/gaia.md) when [Cronos](../deities/cronos.md) castrated him.

## Birth

"All the bloody drops that gushed forth Earth received, and as the seasons moved round she bare the strong Erinyes and the great [Giants](giants.md) with gleaming armour, holding long spears in their hands and the Nymphs whom they call Meliae all over the boundless earth."[^theog-birth]

[^theog-birth]: "All the bloody drops that gushed forth Earth received, and as the seasons moved round she bare the strong Erinyes and the great Giants with gleaming armour, holding long spears in their hands and the Nymphs whom they call Meliae all over the boundless earth." (Theogony 183-187, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## In the Iliad

### Phoenix's Curse (Book IX)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book IX, Phoenix tells how his father Amyntor "called the dire Erinyes to look that never should any dear son sprung of my body sit upon my knees: and the gods fulfilled his curse, even Zeus of the underworld and dread [Persephone](../deities/persephone.md)."[^il9-phoenix]

### Althaia's Curse on Meleager (Book IX)

In the same book, Meleager's mother Althaia invokes them: "with her hands likewise beat instantly upon the fertile earth, calling on [Hades](../deities/hades.md) and dread [Persephone](../deities/persephone.md)... to bring her son to death; and Erinnys that walketh in darkness, whose heart knoweth not ruth, heard her from Erebos."[^il9-althaia]

The description "Erinnys that walketh in darkness, whose heart knoweth not ruth" is the most vivid characterization of them in any source processed so far.

[^il9-phoenix]: "he was sore angered with me... and called the dire Erinyes to look that never should any dear son sprung of my body sit upon my knees: and the gods fulfilled his curse, even Zeus of the underworld and dread Persephone" (Iliad IX.5338-5341, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il9-althaia]: "she, grieved for her brethren's death, prayed instantly to the gods, and with her hands likewise beat instantly upon the fertile earth, calling on Hades and dread Persephone, while she knelt upon her knees and made her bosom wet with tears, to bring her son to death; and Erinnys that walketh in darkness, whose heart knoweth not ruth, heard her from Erebos" (Iliad IX.5429-5434)

### Triple Role (Book XIX)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book XIX, the Erinyes appear in three distinct roles:

1. **As agents of madness**: Agamemnon blames "[Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) and Destiny and Erinys that walketh in the darkness, who put into my soul fierce madness on the day when in the assembly I, even I, bereft Achilles of his meed."[^il19-madness]

2. **As oath-enforcers**: In his oath, Agamemnon invokes "[Zeus](../deities/zeus.md)... and Earth, and Sun, and Erinyes, who under earth take vengeance upon men, whosoever forsweareth himself."[^il19-oath]

3. **As guardians of natural order**: When Achilles' horse Xanthos prophesies his death (given speech by [Hera](../deities/hera.md)), "the Erinyes stayed his voice" — enforcing the boundary between animal and human speech.[^il19-voice]

[^il19-madness]: "Zeus and Destiny and Erinys that walketh in the darkness, who put into my soul fierce madness on the day when in the assembly I, even I, bereft Achilles of his meed. What could I do? it is God who accomplisheth all" (Iliad XIX.10997-11000, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il19-oath]: "Be Zeus before all witness, highest and best of the gods, and Earth, and Sun, and Erinyes, who under earth take vengeance upon men, whosoever forsweareth himself" (Iliad XIX.11140-11142)
[^il19-voice]: "Now when he had thus spoken the Erinyes stayed his voice" (Iliad XIX.11280)

## In the Odyssey

### The Erinnys and Melampus (Book XV)

In [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) Book XV, within the Melampus digression, the Erinnys appears in singular form: Melampus was "suffering strong pains for the sake of the daughter of Neleus, and for the dread blindness of soul which the goddess, the Erinnys of the dolorous stroke, had laid on him."[^od15-melampus] The epithet "the Erinnys of the dolorous stroke" is notable — it uses the singular form, treating the Erinnys as a single goddess rather than a collective, and the phrase "of the dolorous stroke" adds a distinct characterisation alongside the Iliad's "that walketh in darkness, whose heart knoweth not ruth."

[^od15-melampus]: "suffering strong pains for the sake of the daughter of Neleus, and for the dread blindness of soul which the goddess, the Erinnys of the dolorous stroke, had laid on him" (Odyssey XV.8198-8199, trans. Butcher and Lang)

### The Daughters of Pandareus (Book XX)

In [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) Book XX, Penelope tells the myth of the daughters of Pandareus. After their parents were slain by the gods, the orphaned maidens were blessed by four goddesses: [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md) "cherished them with curds and sweet honey and delicious wine," [Hera](../deities/hera.md) gave them "beauty and wisdom beyond the lot of women," [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md) "dowered them with stature," and [Athena](../deities/athena.md) "taught them skill in all famous handiwork." But while Aphrodite was away on [Olympus](../places/olympus.md) seeking marriages for them, "the spirits of the storm snatched away these maidens, and gave them to be handmaids to the hateful Erinyes."[^od20-pandareus]

The passage is striking because the Erinyes receive the maidens as a kind of cosmic payment — despite the girls' innocence and the gods' own gifts. The storm spirits act as intermediaries, delivering the daughters not to death but to servitude under the Erinyes.

[^od20-pandareus]: "the spirits of the storm snatched away these maidens, and gave them to be handmaids to the hateful Erinyes" (Odyssey 10830-10831, trans. Butcher and Lang)

## In the Bibliotheca

Apollodorus names the individual [Erinyes](../creatures/erinyes.md) — a detail not found in any earlier source processed so far. When [Cronos](../deities/cronos.md) castrated [Uranus](../deities/uranus.md), "from the drops of the flowing blood were born Furies, to wit, Alecto, Tisiphone, and Megaera."[^apd-erinyes-names]

This is the first source to give the Erinyes their individual names. The [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md) calls them simply "the strong Erinyes"; the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) and [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) refer to them collectively or in the singular.

[^apd-erinyes-names]: "from the drops of the flowing blood were born Furies, to wit, Alecto, Tisiphone, and Megaera" (Bibliotheca 1.1.4, trans. Frazer)

[^theb-curse]: "great misery fell on his heart, and he straight-way called down bitter curses there in the presence of both his sons. And the avenging Fury of the gods failed not to hear him as he prayed that they might never divide their father's goods in loving brotherhood, but that war and fighting might be ever the portion of them both" (Thebaid, Fragment 2, trans.
