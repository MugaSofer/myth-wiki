## Overview

**Centaurs** were a race of creatures with the upper body of a man and the lower body of a horse, dwelling primarily in the mountains and forests of Thessaly. They are most often depicted in the sources as wild, violent, and unable to hold their wine — though [Chiron](chiron.md) and Pholus stand as notable exceptions. The centaurs appear most prominently in two contexts: the battle at the wedding of Pirithous (the centauromachy), and [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md)' encounters with individual centaurs during his labours.

## Origin

The sources give two slightly different accounts of how the centaurs came to exist.

[Pindar](../sources/pindar.md) provides the fullest genealogy. [Ixion](../heroes/ixion.md) lay with a cloud fashioned by [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) in the likeness of [Hera](../deities/hera.md) — "he lay with a cloud, pursuing the sweet lie, fond man: for its form was as the form of the most highest among the daughters of heaven."[^pin-cloud] This union produced not the centaurs directly, but their ancestor Kentauros — "His mate, without favour of the Graces, bare unto him a monstrous son, and like no other thing anywhere, even as its mother was, a thing with no place or honour, neither among men, neither in the society of gods. Him she reared and called by the name Kentauros."[^pin-kentauros] Kentauros then mated with Magnesian mares in the valleys of Pelion, "and there were born thence a wondrous tribe, like unto both parents, their nether parts like unto the dams, and their upper parts like unto the sire."[^pin-tribe]

[Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) gives a briefer version: Ixion "attempted to force" Hera, Zeus "made a cloud in the likeness of Hera and laid it beside him," and "the cloud, impregnated by Ixion, gave birth to Centaurus."[^apd-ixion]

[Hyginus](../sources/hyginus.md) simplifies further, omitting the intermediate ancestor altogether: "Juno, by Jove's instructions, substituted a cloud, which Ixion believed to be the likeness of Juno. From this the Centaurs were born."[^hyg-ixion]

[Chiron](chiron.md) has a separate origin entirely — born of [Cronos](../deities/cronos.md) and the Oceanid Philyra, not from the Ixion lineage at all.

## Appearance

The centaurs are described as "double membered" and "double-natured" in [Ovid](../sources/metamorphoses.md)'s account of the centauromachy.[^met-double] Pindar calls them a tribe whose "nether parts" resembled mares and "upper parts" resembled their sire.[^pin-tribe] [Euripides](../sources/euripides-iphigenia-aulis.md) calls them the "horse-mounted troop."[^eur-centaurs]

In the [Aeneid](../sources/aeneid.md), [Virgil](../sources/aeneid.md) calls them "twy-shaped" and places phantom centaurs among the monstrous shapes at the gates of the Underworld.[^aen-centaurs]

## The Centauromachy

The battle between the centaurs and the Lapiths at the wedding of Pirithous and Hippodamia is the most famous centaur episode. Multiple sources describe it, with significant differences in detail.

### In the Bibliotheca

[Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) gives a concise account. Pirithous "feasted the centaurs because they were her kinsmen. But being unaccustomed to wine, they made themselves drunk by swilling it greedily, and when the bride was brought in, they attempted to violate her."[^apd-wedding] [Theseus](../heroes/theseus.md) fought alongside Pirithous, and "Theseus killed many of them."[^apd-theseus]

In the same passage, Apollodorus notes [Caeneus](../heroes/caeneus.md)' role: "in the battle with the centaurs he thought scorn of wounds and killed many of the centaurs; but the rest of them surrounded him and by striking him with fir trees buried him in the earth."[^apd-caeneus]

### In the Metamorphoses

[Ovid](../sources/metamorphoses.md) provides the most elaborate telling, narrated by [Nestor](../heroes/nestor.md) at a feast after the killing of [Cygnus](../heroes/cygnus.md). The centaur Eurytus — "wildest of the wild centaurs, now inflamed with sudden envy, drunkenness, and lust" — seized the bride Hippodame, and "each one of all the centaurs took at will the maid or matron that he longed for most."[^met-eurytus]

[Theseus](../heroes/theseus.md) struck first, hurling an ancient bowl into Eurytus's face, and the centaur fell "spouting out thick gouts of blood... his brains and wine mixed."[^met-theseus-strike] His "double membered centaur brothers, wild with passion at his death, all shouted out, 'To arms! to arms!' Their courage raised by wine!"[^met-brothers]

The battle that followed included many individual combats. [Peleus](../heroes/peleus.md) killed Demoleon with a lance "which piercing through his shivered ribs, hung there and quivered in the bones," then slew Myles, Phlegraeus, Iphinous, and Clanis.[^met-peleus] Among the centaurs, the beautiful Cyllarus was slain — "Many a female of his kind loved him, but only Hylonome gained his love. There was no other centaur maid so beautiful as she within the woods." When Cyllarus fell, Hylonome threw herself upon the same spear and died embracing him.[^met-cyllarus]

[Caeneus](../heroes/caeneus.md) killed five centaurs before the centaur Monychus rallied the survivors: "Let us heap tree-trunks and stones and mountains on him! Crush his stubborn life! Let forests smother him to death!"[^met-monychus] They buried him under trees stripped from the mountainside.

After Nestor finished his tale, Tlepolemus complained that no praise had been given to [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md), and Nestor acknowledged that Heracles too "overcame in battle those cloud born centaurs."[^met-tlepolemus]

### In the Odyssey

[Homer](../sources/odyssey.md) alludes to the centauromachy through Antinous's warning to the disguised [Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md): "Wine it is that wounds thee, honey sweet wine, that is the bane of others too... Wine it was that darkened the mind even of the Centaur, renowned Eurytion, in the hall of high-hearted Peirithous, when he went to the Lapithae." The centaur "wrought foul deeds in his frenzy," and the heroes "shorn off his ears and nostrils with the pitiless sword." Antinous concludes: "Thence was the feud begun between the Centaurs and mankind; but first for himself gat he hurt, being heavy with wine."[^od-eurytion]

### In the Fabulae

[Hyginus](../sources/hyginus.md) describes two centaur incidents at weddings. First, at the court of King Dexamenus, the centaur Eurytion — "son of Ixion and Nubes" — sought [Deianira](../heroes/deianira.md) as a wife after Heracles departed. "On the appointed day he came with his brothers to the wedding. Hercules intervened, and killed the Centaur, and led home his betrothed."[^hyg-eurytion] Second, "at another marriage, when Pirithous was taking Hippodamia, daughter of Adrastus, Centaurs, full of wine, attempted to carry off the wives of the Lapithae. The Centaurs killed many of them, but by them perished."[^hyg-pirithous]

### In the Argonautica

[Apollonius](../sources/argonautica.md) mentions the centauromachy in passing, noting that the Argonaut Polyphemus, son of Eilatus, had in his youth "among the mighty Lapithae, when they were arming themselves against the Centaurs, fought in his younger days; now his limbs were grown heavy with age, but his martial spirit still remained, even as of old."[^arg-polyphemus]

## Heracles and the Centaurs

### Pholus and the Wine Jar

During the hunt for the Erymanthian Boar, [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) "was entertained by the centaur Pholus, a son of Silenus by a Melian nymph. He set roast meat before Hercules, while he himself ate his meat raw."[^apd-pholus] When Heracles asked for wine, Pholus "said he feared to open the jar which belonged to the centaurs in common." Heracles opened it anyway, and "not long afterwards, scenting the smell, the centaurs arrived at the cave of Pholus, armed with rocks and firs."[^apd-jar]

Heracles repelled the first attackers with brands, then shot and pursued the rest. Some fled to Chiron at Mount Malea, and as Heracles shot at them, an arrow passed through the arm of the centaur Elatus and struck [Chiron](chiron.md) in the knee — an incurable wound that ultimately led to Chiron's death and the exchange of his immortality with [Prometheus](../deities/prometheus.md).[^apd-chiron-wound]

"The rest of the centaurs fled in different directions, and some came to Mount Malea, and Eurytion to Pholoe, and Nessus to the river Evenus. The rest of them Poseidon received at Eleusis and hid them in a mountain."[^apd-scatter] Pholus died accidentally — "drawing the arrow from a corpse, wondered that so little a thing could kill such big fellows; howbeit, it slipped from his hand and lighting on his foot killed him on the spot."[^apd-pholus-death]

### Nessus at the River Evenus

Later, Heracles came to the river Evenus, "at which the centaur Nessus sat and ferried passengers across for hire, alleging that he had received the ferry from the gods for his righteousness."[^apd-nessus] Heracles crossed alone but entrusted [Deianira](../heroes/deianira.md) to Nessus to carry. "But he, in ferrying her across, attempted to violate her. She cried out, Hercules heard her, and shot Nessus to the heart."[^apd-nessus-death]

Hyginus adds that Nessus, dying, "knowing how poisonous the arrows were, since they had been dipped in the gall of the Lernaean Hydra, drew out some of his blood and gave it to Dejanira, telling her it was a love-charm."[^hyg-nessus] This poisoned blood would later cause [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md)' death when Deianira smeared it on a robe.

Ovid gives the most detailed version of Nessus's attack. Nessus, "strong-limbed and well-acquainted with those fords," offered to carry Deianira across. When Heracles shot him, life-blood "spurted instantly, mixed with the Lernaean poison."[^met-nessus]

### Eurytion and Dexamenus's Daughter

Hyginus records that Heracles "killed Eurytion the Centaur because he wooed Dejanira, daughter of Dexamenus, his hoped-for bride."[^hyg-eurytion-incidental] Apollodorus places this after the cleansing of the Augean stables: "He found Dexamenus on the point of betrothing perforce his daughter Mnesimache to the centaur Eurytion, and being called upon by him for help, he slew Eurytion when that centaur came to fetch his bride."[^apd-eurytion]

## Centaurs and Atalanta

[Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) records that [Atalanta](../heroes/atalanta.md), who "kept herself a virgin, and hunting in the wilderness she remained always under arms," was attacked by "the centaurs Rhoecus and Hylaeus" who "tried to force her, but were shot down and killed by her."[^apd-atalanta]

## In the Iliad

[Homer](../sources/iliad.md) makes a single reference to centaurs, calling [Chiron](chiron.md) "the most righteous of the Centaurs" in the context of Chiron having taught Achilles the healing arts.[^il-chiron]

## In the Aeneid

[Virgil](../sources/aeneid.md) places centaurs among the monstrous phantoms at the entrance to the Underworld — "Centaurs and twy-shaped Scyllas, and the hundredfold Briareus, and the beast of Lerna hissing horribly."[^aen-centaurs] Elsewhere, he uses centaurs as a simile for warriors descending from the mountains: "as when two cloud-born Centaurs descend from a lofty mountain peak, leaving Homole or snowy Othrys in rapid race; the mighty forest yields before them as they go."[^aen-simile]

## In Euripides

In [Iphigenia in Aulis](../sources/euripides-iphigenia-aulis.md), Clytemnestra asks whether the centaurs dwell near Chiron's home at the foot of Pelion, and the chorus describes "the horse-mounted troop of the Centaurs" coming "to the banquet of the Gods and the cup of Bacchus" at the wedding of [Peleus](../heroes/peleus.md) and [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md).[^eur-centaurs]

## Parentage of Individual Centaurs

Hyginus identifies the centaur Eurytion as "son of Ixion and Nubes" and also Nessus as "son of Ixion and Nubes."[^hyg-eurytion][^hyg-nessus-parentage] Apollodorus describes Pholus as "a son of Silenus by a Melian nymph" — a different parentage entirely from the Ixion lineage.[^apd-pholus] [Chiron](chiron.md), born of Cronos and Philyra, also stands apart.

Hyginus lists Pirithous as "son of Ixion, brother of Centaurus" among the Argonauts — making the eponymous ancestor of the centaur race Pirithous's half-brother.[^hyg-pirithous-brother]
