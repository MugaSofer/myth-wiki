## Overview

The **Calydonian Boar** was a monstrous beast sent by [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md) to ravage the land of Calydon in punishment for King [Oeneus](../heroes/oeneus.md)' failure to sacrifice to her. Its hunt drew together heroes from across Greece and ended in the boar's death at the hands of [Meleager](../heroes/meleager.md), but the aftermath — a quarrel over the spoils — led to Meleager's own death and a broader war between the Aetolians and the Curetes.

## Origin

All sources agree that Artemis sent the boar in anger at Oeneus. In the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md), Phoenix tells the tale to [Achilles](../heroes/achilles.md): "Artemis of the golden throne had brought a plague upon them, in wrath that Oineus offered her not the harvest first-fruits on the fat of his garden land; for all the other gods had their feast of hecatombs, and only to the daughter of great Zeus offered he not, whether he forgat or marked it not; and therein sinned he sore in his heart."[^il9-artemis]

[Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) gives the same cause: "In sacrificing the first fruits of the annual crops of the country to all the gods Oeneus forgot Artemis alone. But she in her wrath sent a boar of extraordinary size and strength, which prevented the land from being sown and destroyed the cattle and the people that fell in with it."[^apd-origin]

[Ovid](../sources/metamorphoses.md) dramatises Artemis's response: "'Am I to suffer this indignity?' she cried, 'Though I am thus dishonored, I will not be unrevenged!' And so the boar was sent to ravage the fair land of Calydon."[^met-diana]

[Hyginus](../sources/hyginus.md) agrees: "Diana, in anger, sent a boar of immense size to lay waste the district of Calydon."[^hyg-boar]

## Appearance

Homer calls it simply "a fierce wild boar, white-tusked, that wrought sore ill continually on Oineus' garden land; many a tall tree laid he low utterly, even root and apple blossom therewith."[^il9-boar]

Ovid gives the most elaborate physical description: "this avenging boar was quite as large as bulls now feeding on the green Epirus, and larger than the bulls of Sicily. A dreadful boar. — His burning, bloodshot eyes seemed coals of living fire, and his rough neck was knotted with stiff muscles, and thick-set with bristles like sharp spikes. A seething froth dripped on his shoulders, and his tusks were like the spoils of Ind. Discordant roars reverberated from his hideous jaws; and lightning — belched forth from his horrid throat — scorched the green fields."[^met-appearance]

The boar's devastation is extensive in Ovid: "He trampled the green corn and doomed the farmer to lament his crops... Long branches of the vine and heavy grapes are scattered in confusion, and the fruits and branches of the olive tree, whose leaves should never wither, are cast on the ground."[^met-devastation]

## The Hunt

### Participants

Oeneus called together "all the noblest men of Greece" and "promised that to him who should kill the beast he would give the skin as a prize."[^apd-prize]

[Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) lists the hunters: "[Meleager](../heroes/meleager.md), son of Oeneus; Dryas, son of Ares; these came from Calydon; Idas and Lynceus, sons of Aphareus, from Messene; Castor and Pollux, sons of Zeus and Leda, from Lacedaemon; [Theseus](../heroes/theseus.md), son of Aegeus, from Athens; Admetus, son of Pheres, from Pherae; Ancaeus and Cepheus, sons of Lycurgus, from Arcadia; Jason, son of Aeson, from Iolcus; Iphicles, son of Amphitryon, from Thebes; Pirithous, son of Ixion, from Larissa; [Peleus](../heroes/peleus.md), son of Aeacus, from Phthia; Telamon, son of Aeacus, from Salamis; Eurytion, son of Actor, from Phthia; [Atalanta](../heroes/atalanta.md), daughter of Schoeneus, from Arcadia; [Amphiaraus](../heroes/amphiaraus.md), son of Oicles, from Argos."[^apd-hunters]

[Hyginus](../sources/hyginus.md) lists a slightly different roster, adding [Laertes](../heroes/laertes.md), Deucalion, Phoenix, Mopsus, [Caeneus](../heroes/caeneus.md), and Asclepius among others.[^hyg-hunters] He also enumerates the states that sent help: "Iolcos, Sparta, Pleurone, Messene, Perrhaebia, Phthia, Magnesia, Salamin, Calydon, Thessalia, Oichalia, Ithaca, Tegea, Crete, Dolopia, Athens, and Arcadia."[^hyg-states]

Ovid's list adds [Nestor](../heroes/nestor.md) ("youthful then") and describes [Atalanta](../heroes/atalanta.md) vividly: "a polished buckle fastened her attire; her lustrous hair was fashioned in a knot; her weapons rattled in an ivory case, swung from her white left shoulder, and she held a bow in her left hand. Her face appeared as maidenly for boy, or boyish for girl."[^met-atalanta]

### The Battle

In [Ovid](../sources/metamorphoses.md)'s account, the boar is flushed from a marshy thicket and immediately wreaks havoc. Echion's spear glances off a maple; Jason overthrows. The soothsayer Mopsus prays to Apollo for his spear to strike true — Apollo guides it, but Diana knocks the iron head from the shaft, "and the blunt wood fell harmless from his hide."[^met-diana-deflects]

The boar then "rushed among this band of noble lads, and stretched upon the ground Eupalamon and Pelagon." The son of Hippocoon is hamstrung. Nestor "vaulted on his long lance from the ground into the branches of a sheltering tree" to escape.[^met-nestor] Ancaeus, boasting "See the weapons of a man excel a woman's!" rushed in with a double-edged axe — "the savage boar caught him, and ripped his tushes through his groin... and his torn entrails and his crimson blood stained the fair verdure of the spot with death."[^met-ancaeus]

Atalanta drew first blood: "the virgin, Atalanta, took her bow and fitting a sharp arrow to the notch, twanged the tight cord. The feathered shaft quivered beneath the monster's ear, the red blood stained his hard bristles."[^met-atalanta-strikes] Meleager cried: "Give honor to the courage of a maid!"[^met-honor]

Meleager struck the killing blow: "first he hurled a spear that missed and quivered in the ground; but next he hurled a spear with certain aim. It pierced the middle of the monster's back." He then "plunged a spear deep in the monster's shoulder" and pressed "his conquering foot upon the monster's head."[^met-kill]

### In the Iliad

Homer's version in [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book 9 is briefer about the hunt itself — "him slew Meleagros the son of Oineus, having gathered together from many cities huntsmen and hounds; for not of few men could the boar be slain, so mighty was he; and many an one brought he to the grievous pyre" — but focuses on the aftermath.[^il9-hunt]

## Aftermath: The Quarrel over the Spoils

### In the Metamorphoses

Meleager gave the boar's pelt and tusked head to [Atalanta](../heroes/atalanta.md) "for her valor." The sons of Thestius (Meleager's uncles) objected: "Give up the prize! Let not the confidence of your great beauty be a snare to you! A woman should not interfering filch the manly honors of a mighty hunt!"[^met-thestius] They seized the spoils. Meleager killed Plexippus and then Toxeus with his sword.[^met-kills-uncles]

When Althaea learned her son had killed her brothers, she retrieved the magical brand the [Fates](../deities/groups/fates.md) had tied to Meleager's life at birth: "Unto you we give, O child new-born! only the life of this; the period of this billet is your life."[^met-fates] Torn between maternal love and sisterly grief, she finally cast it into the fire, and Meleager died in agony.[^met-brand]

### In the Bibliotheca

[Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) gives two versions. In the first, Meleager "gave the skin to Atalanta" and when his uncles, the sons of Thestius, "claimed the skin on the ground that Iphiclus had been the first to hit the boar," Meleager killed them. "Incensed by the slaughter of her brothers Althaea kindled the brand, and Meleager immediately expired."[^apd-brand]

The alternative: "when the sons of Thestius claimed the skin... war broke out between the Curetes and the Calydonians; and when Meleager had sallied out and slain some of the sons of Thestius, Althaea cursed him, and he in a rage remained at home."[^apd-war] Only when the enemy approached the walls did his wife Cleopatra persuade him to fight again. "Having killed the rest of the sons of Thestius, he himself fell fighting."[^apd-death]

### In the Iliad

Homer's account — the earliest — matches Apollodorus's second version. After the hunt, Artemis "made much turmoil over him and tumult concerning the boar's head and shaggy hide, between the Kuretes and great-hearted Aitolians."[^il9-turmoil] While Meleager fought, the Aetolians prevailed. But "when Meleagros grew full of wrath... in anger of heart at his dear mother Althaia he tarried beside his wedded wife, fair Kleopatra."[^il9-wrath] Althaea, "grieved for her brethren's death, prayed instantly to the gods, and with her hands likewise beat instantly upon the fertile earth, calling on Hades and dread Persephone... to bring her son to death."[^il9-curse]

Only when "the Kuretes were climbing upon the towers and firing the great city" did Cleopatra persuade Meleager to fight — Phoenix uses this tale as a warning to Achilles about refusing gifts and sulking in his tent.[^il9-warning]

### In the Fabulae

[Hyginus](../sources/hyginus.md) follows the brand version: Meleager "gave the hide to the virgin Atalanta because of her valor." His uncles tried to take it; he killed them. Althaea "brought out the brand from the chest and threw it on the fire."[^hyg-brand] After Meleager's death, "his sisters, all except Gorge and Deianeira, because of their weeping, were by the will of the gods changed into birds. These are called Meleagrides, 'guinea hens.'"[^hyg-birds]

## Peleus and Eurytion

[Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) records a separate tragedy at the hunt: [Peleus](../heroes/peleus.md) "went with Eurytion to hunt the Calydonian boar, but in throwing a dart at the hog he involuntarily struck and killed Eurytion."[^apd-peleus] This accidental killing forced Peleus into exile again.

## Variant Traditions

The sources disagree on how Meleager died. Homer and Apollodorus's second version describe him dying in battle during the war that followed the hunt, after his mother's curse drove him to withdraw. Ovid, Apollodorus's first version, and Hyginus all use the magical firebrand that Althaea destroys to kill him. Homer notably makes no mention of the brand at all.

The sources also differ on Atalanta's role. In Ovid, she draws first blood by shooting the boar below the ear. In Apollodorus, Atalanta "was the first to shoot the boar... but Amphiaraus shot it in the eye, and Meleager killed it."[^apd-atalanta] In Homer, Atalanta is not mentioned at all.
