## Overview

The **Cyclopes** are three beings born of [Gaia](../deities/gaia.md) and [Uranus](../deities/uranus.md). They later gave [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) the thunder and [thunderbolt](../objects/thunderbolt.md).

## Description

"In all else they were like the gods, but one eye only was set in the midst of their fore-heads. And they were surnamed Cyclopes (Orb-eyed) because one orbed eye was set in their foreheads."[^theog-desc] They are described as "overbearing in spirit," and "strength and might and craft were in their works."[^theog-craft]

[^theog-desc]: "In all else they were like the gods, but one eye only was set in the midst of their fore-heads. And they were surnamed Cyclopes (Orb-eyed) because one orbed eye was set in their foreheads." (Theogony 142-145, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^theog-craft]: "she bare the Cyclopes, overbearing in spirit" ... "Strength and might and craft were in their works." (Theogony 139, 146)

## Members

1. **Brontes**
2. **Steropes**
3. **Arges** ("stubborn-hearted")

## Role

They "gave Zeus the thunder and made the [thunderbolt](../objects/thunderbolt.md)."[^theog-thunder]

[^theog-thunder]: "who gave Zeus the thunder and made the thunderbolt" (Theogony 141)

## In the Odyssey

The [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) introduces a different kind of Cyclops from the Theogonic craftsmen. [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) names "godlike Polyphemus whose power is mightiest amongst all the Cyclôpes." Unlike the three Theogonic Cyclopes (sons of [Gaia](../deities/gaia.md) and [Uranus](../deities/uranus.md) who forged Zeus's thunderbolt), Polyphemus is a son of [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md): "His mother was the nymph Thoösa, daughter of Phorcys, lord of the unharvested sea, and in the hollow caves she lay with Poseidon."[^od1-polyphemus]

Poseidon's "quenchless anger" at Odysseus for blinding Polyphemus drives the entire plot of the Odyssey.[^od1-wrath]

### The Cyclopes as a People (Book IX)

Odysseus describes the Cyclopes as "a froward and a lawless folk, who trusting to the deathless gods plant not aught with their hands, neither plough: but, behold, all these things spring for them in plenty, unsown and untilled, wheat, and barley, and vines, which bear great clusters of the juice of the grape, and the rain of Zeus gives them increase."[^od9-folk] They have no civic institutions: "These have neither gatherings for council nor oracles of law, but they dwell in hollow caves on the crests of the high hills, and each one utters the law to his children and his wives, and they reck not one of another."[^od9-law]

They are related to the gods: the Phaeacians claim to be "near of kin" to the Cyclopes, and the Cyclopes are named alongside the [Giants](giants.md) as peoples who interact openly with the gods (Book VII).[^od7-kin]

[^od9-folk]: "we came to the land of the Cyclôpes, a froward and a lawless folk, who trusting to the deathless gods plant not aught with their hands, neither plough: but, behold, all these things spring for them in plenty, unsown and untilled, wheat, and barley, and vines, which bear great clusters of the juice of the grape, and the rain of Zeus gives them increase" (Odyssey IX.4832-4837, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od9-law]: "These have neither gatherings for council nor oracles of law, but they dwell in hollow caves on the crests of the high hills, and each one utters the law to his children and his wives, and they reck not one of another" (Odyssey IX.4838-4841)
[^od7-kin]: "near of kin to them, even as are the Cyclôpes and the wild tribes of the Giants" (Odyssey VII.3955-3956)

### Polyphemus (Book IX)

Polyphemus is described in extraordinary terms: "a man was wont to sleep therein, of monstrous size, who shepherded his flocks alone and afar, and was not conversant with others, but dwelt apart in lawlessness of mind. Yea, for he was a monstrous thing and fashioned marvellously, nor was he like to any man that lives by bread, but like a wooded peak of the towering hills, which stands out apart and alone from others."[^od9-size]

He defiantly rejects the authority of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) and the gods: "Thou art witless, my stranger, or thou hast come from afar, who biddest me either to fear or shun the gods. For the Cyclôpes pay no heed to Zeus, lord of the aegis, nor to the blessed gods, for verily we are better men than they."[^od9-defy]

Yet he also claims [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) as his father and healer: "his son am I, and he avows him for my father. And he himself will heal me, if it be his will; and none other of the blessed gods or of mortal men."[^od9-father]

After Odysseus blinds him, Polyphemus prays to Poseidon: "Hear me, Poseidon, girdler of the earth, god of the dark hair, if indeed I be thine, and thou avowest thee my sire,—grant that he may never come to his home, even Odysseus, waster of cities, the son of Laertes, whose dwelling is in Ithaca; yet if he is ordained to see his friends and come unto his well-builded house, and his own country, late may he come in evil case, with the loss of all his company, in the ship of strangers, and find sorrows in his house." And "the god of the dark locks heard him."[^od9-prayer]

A previous prophecy had foretold this: Polyphemus recalls the soothsayer Telemus son of Eurymus, who "told me that all these things should come to pass in the aftertime, even that I should lose my eyesight at the hand of Odysseus. But I ever looked for some tall and goodly man to come hither, clad in great might."[^od9-prophecy]

[^od9-size]: "a man was wont to sleep therein, of monstrous size, who shepherded his flocks alone and afar, and was not conversant with others, but dwelt apart in lawlessness of mind. Yea, for he was a monstrous thing and fashioned marvellously, nor was he like to any man that lives by bread, but like a wooded peak of the towering hills, which stands out apart and alone from others" (Odyssey IX.4906-4911, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od9-defy]: "Thou art witless, my stranger, or thou hast come from afar, who biddest me either to fear or shun the gods. For the Cyclôpes pay no heed to Zeus, lord of the aegis, nor to the blessed gods, for verily we are better men than they" (Odyssey IX.4993-4997)
[^od9-father]: "his son am I, and he avows him for my father. And he himself will heal me, if it be his will; and none other of the blessed gods or of mortal men" (Odyssey IX.5254-5256)
[^od9-prayer]: "Hear me, Poseidon, girdler of the earth, god of the dark hair, if indeed I be thine, and thou avowest thee my sire,—grant that he may never come to his home, even Odysseus, waster of cities, the son of Laertes, whose dwelling is in Ithaca; yet if he is ordained to see his friends and come unto his well-builded house, and his own country, late may he come in evil case, with the loss of all his company, in the ship of strangers, and find sorrows in his house... So he spake in prayer, and the god of the dark locks heard him" (Odyssey IX.5263-5272)
[^od9-prophecy]: "There lived here a soothsayer, a noble man and a mighty, Telemus, son of Eurymus, who surpassed all men in soothsaying, and waxed old as a seer among the Cyclôpes. He told me that all these things should come to pass in the aftertime, even that I should lose my eyesight at the hand of Odysseus" (Odyssey IX.5245-5249)

[^od1-polyphemus]: "godlike Polyphemus whose power is mightiest amongst all the Cyclôpes. His mother was the nymph Thoösa, daughter of Phorcys, lord of the unharvested sea, and in the hollow caves she lay with Poseidon." (Odyssey I.794-797, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od1-wrath]: "it is Poseidon, the girdler of the earth, that hath been wroth continually with quenchless anger for the Cyclops' sake whom he blinded of his eye" (Odyssey I.792-794, trans. Butcher and Lang)

## In the Bibliotheca

Apollodorus confirms the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md)'s account of the Cyclopes' birth, imprisonment, and role: [Uranus](../deities/uranus.md) "bound and cast [them] into Tartarus."[^apd-cyc-prison] Their description is briefer than the Theogony's: "each had one eye on his forehead."[^apd-cyc-desc]

In the [Titanomachy](../events/titanomachy.md), Apollodorus specifies the arms each god received from the Cyclopes — a detail more explicit than in the Theogony: "the Cyclopes then gave [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) thunder and lightning and a thunderbolt, and on [Hades](../deities/hades.md) they bestowed a helmet and on [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) a trident."[^apd-cyc-arms] While the Theogony mentions only the thunderbolt, Apollodorus attributes all three divine weapons to the Cyclopes' craft.

[^apd-cyc-prison]: "them Sky bound and cast into Tartarus, a gloomy place in Hades as far distant from earth as earth is distant from the sky" (Bibliotheca 1.1.2, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-cyc-desc]: "each had one eye on his forehead" (Bibliotheca 1.1.2, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-cyc-arms]: "the Cyclopes then gave Zeus thunder and lightning and a thunderbolt, and on Pluto they bestowed a helmet and on Poseidon a trident" (Bibliotheca 1.2.1, trans. Frazer)
