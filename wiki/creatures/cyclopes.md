## Overview

The **Cyclopes** are three beings born of [Gaia](../deities/gaia.md) and [Uranus](../deities/uranus.md). They later gave [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) the thunder and [thunderbolt](../objects/thunderbolt.md).

## Description

"In all else they were like the gods, but one eye only was set in the midst of their fore-heads. And they were surnamed Cyclopes (Orb-eyed) because one orbed eye was set in their foreheads."[^theog-desc] They are described as "overbearing in spirit," and "strength and might and craft were in their works."[^theog-craft]

[^theog-desc]: "In all else they were like the gods, but one eye only was set in the midst of their fore-heads. And they were surnamed Cyclopes (Orb-eyed) because one orbed eye was set in their foreheads." (Theogony 142-145, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^theog-craft]: "she bare the Cyclopes, overbearing in spirit" ... "Strength and might and craft were in their works." (Theogony 139, 146)

## Members

1. **Brontes**
2. **Steropes**
3. **Arges** ("stubborn-hearted")

## Role

They "gave Zeus the thunder and made the [thunderbolt](../objects/thunderbolt.md)."[^theog-thunder]

[^theog-thunder]: "who gave Zeus the thunder and made the thunderbolt" (Theogony 141)

## In the Odyssey

The [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) introduces a different kind of Cyclops from the Theogonic craftsmen. [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) names "godlike Polyphemus whose power is mightiest amongst all the Cyclôpes." Unlike the three Theogonic Cyclopes (sons of [Gaia](../deities/gaia.md) and [Uranus](../deities/uranus.md) who forged Zeus's thunderbolt), Polyphemus is a son of [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md): "His mother was the nymph Thoösa, daughter of Phorcys, lord of the unharvested sea, and in the hollow caves she lay with Poseidon."[^od1-polyphemus]

Poseidon's "quenchless anger" at Odysseus for blinding Polyphemus drives the entire plot of the Odyssey.[^od1-wrath]

### The Cyclopes as a People (Book IX)

Odysseus describes the Cyclopes as "a froward and a lawless folk, who trusting to the deathless gods plant not aught with their hands, neither plough: but, behold, all these things spring for them in plenty, unsown and untilled, wheat, and barley, and vines, which bear great clusters of the juice of the grape, and the rain of Zeus gives them increase."[^od9-folk] They have no civic institutions: "These have neither gatherings for council nor oracles of law, but they dwell in hollow caves on the crests of the high hills, and each one utters the law to his children and his wives, and they reck not one of another."[^od9-law]

They are related to the gods: the Phaeacians claim to be "near of kin" to the Cyclopes, and the Cyclopes are named alongside the [Giants](giants.md) as peoples who interact openly with the gods (Book VII).[^od7-kin]

[^od9-folk]: "we came to the land of the Cyclôpes, a froward and a lawless folk, who trusting to the deathless gods plant not aught with their hands, neither plough: but, behold, all these things spring for them in plenty, unsown and untilled, wheat, and barley, and vines, which bear great clusters of the juice of the grape, and the rain of Zeus gives them increase" (Odyssey 9.99-104, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od9-law]: "These have neither gatherings for council nor oracles of law, but they dwell in hollow caves on the crests of the high hills, and each one utters the law to his children and his wives, and they reck not one of another" (Odyssey 9.105-108)
[^od7-kin]: "near of kin to them, even as are the Cyclôpes and the wild tribes of the Giants" (Odyssey 7.160-161)

### Polyphemus (Book IX)

Polyphemus is described in extraordinary terms: "a man was wont to sleep therein, of monstrous size, who shepherded his flocks alone and afar, and was not conversant with others, but dwelt apart in lawlessness of mind. Yea, for he was a monstrous thing and fashioned marvellously, nor was he like to any man that lives by bread, but like a wooded peak of the towering hills, which stands out apart and alone from others."[^od9-size]

He defiantly rejects the authority of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) and the gods: "Thou art witless, my stranger, or thou hast come from afar, who biddest me either to fear or shun the gods. For the Cyclôpes pay no heed to Zeus, lord of the aegis, nor to the blessed gods, for verily we are better men than they."[^od9-defy]

Yet he also claims [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) as his father and healer: "his son am I, and he avows him for my father. And he himself will heal me, if it be his will; and none other of the blessed gods or of mortal men."[^od9-father]

After Odysseus blinds him, Polyphemus prays to Poseidon: "Hear me, Poseidon, girdler of the earth, god of the dark hair, if indeed I be thine, and thou avowest thee my sire,—grant that he may never come to his home, even Odysseus, waster of cities, the son of Laertes, whose dwelling is in Ithaca; yet if he is ordained to see his friends and come unto his well-builded house, and his own country, late may he come in evil case, with the loss of all his company, in the ship of strangers, and find sorrows in his house." And "the god of the dark locks heard him."[^od9-prayer]

A previous prophecy had foretold this: Polyphemus recalls the soothsayer Telemus son of Eurymus, who "told me that all these things should come to pass in the aftertime, even that I should lose my eyesight at the hand of Odysseus. But I ever looked for some tall and goodly man to come hither, clad in great might."[^od9-prophecy]

[^od9-size]: "a man was wont to sleep therein, of monstrous size, who shepherded his flocks alone and afar, and was not conversant with others, but dwelt apart in lawlessness of mind. Yea, for he was a monstrous thing and fashioned marvellously, nor was he like to any man that lives by bread, but like a wooded peak of the towering hills, which stands out apart and alone from others" (Odyssey 9.172-177, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od9-defy]: "Thou art witless, my stranger, or thou hast come from afar, who biddest me either to fear or shun the gods. For the Cyclôpes pay no heed to Zeus, lord of the aegis, nor to the blessed gods, for verily we are better men than they" (Odyssey 9.257-261)
[^od9-father]: "his son am I, and he avows him for my father. And he himself will heal me, if it be his will; and none other of the blessed gods or of mortal men" (Odyssey 9.514-516)
[^od9-prayer]: "Hear me, Poseidon, girdler of the earth, god of the dark hair, if indeed I be thine, and thou avowest thee my sire,—grant that he may never come to his home, even Odysseus, waster of cities, the son of Laertes, whose dwelling is in Ithaca; yet if he is ordained to see his friends and come unto his well-builded house, and his own country, late may he come in evil case, with the loss of all his company, in the ship of strangers, and find sorrows in his house... So he spake in prayer, and the god of the dark locks heard him" (Odyssey 9.523-532)
[^od9-prophecy]: "There lived here a soothsayer, a noble man and a mighty, Telemus, son of Eurymus, who surpassed all men in soothsaying, and waxed old as a seer among the Cyclôpes. He told me that all these things should come to pass in the aftertime, even that I should lose my eyesight at the hand of Odysseus" (Odyssey 9.505-509)

[^od1-polyphemus]: "godlike Polyphemus whose power is mightiest amongst all the Cyclôpes. His mother was the nymph Thoösa, daughter of Phorcys, lord of the unharvested sea, and in the hollow caves she lay with Poseidon." (Odyssey 1.74-77, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od1-wrath]: "it is Poseidon, the girdler of the earth, that hath been wroth continually with quenchless anger for the Cyclops' sake whom he blinded of his eye" (Odyssey 1.73-74, trans. Butcher and Lang)

## In the Bibliotheca

Apollodorus confirms the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md)'s account of the Cyclopes' birth, imprisonment, and role: [Uranus](../deities/uranus.md) "bound and cast [them] into Tartarus."[^apd-cyc-prison] Their description is briefer than the Theogony's: "each had one eye on his forehead."[^apd-cyc-desc]

In the [Titanomachy](../events/titanomachy.md), Apollodorus specifies the arms each god received from the Cyclopes — a detail more explicit than in the Theogony: "the Cyclopes then gave [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) thunder and lightning and a thunderbolt, and on [Hades](../deities/hades.md) they bestowed a helmet and on [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) a trident."[^apd-cyc-arms] While the Theogony mentions only the thunderbolt, Apollodorus attributes all three divine weapons to the Cyclopes' craft.

[^apd-cyc-prison]: "them Sky bound and cast into Tartarus, a gloomy place in Hades as far distant from earth as earth is distant from the sky" (Bibliotheca 1.1.2, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-cyc-desc]: "each had one eye on his forehead" (Bibliotheca 1.1.2, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-cyc-arms]: "the Cyclopes then gave Zeus thunder and lightning and a thunderbolt, and on Pluto they bestowed a helmet and on Poseidon a trident" (Bibliotheca 1.2.1, trans. Frazer)

## In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md)

### Polyphemus, Galatea, and Acis (13.738-897)

The [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md) gives Polyphemus a love story. The sea-nymph Galatea, daughter of [Nereus](../deities/nereus.md) and Doris, tells [Scylla](scylla.md) how the Cyclops pursued her with constant passion while she loved the youth Acis, son of Faunus. Polyphemus tried to make himself presentable: "Now, Polyphemus, wretched Cyclops, you are careful of appearance, and you try the art of pleasing. You have even combed your stiffened hair with rakes: it pleases you to trim your shaggy beard with sickles, while you gaze at your fierce features in a pool."[^met-cyc-grooming]

He sang to Galatea from a hilltop, playing shepherd-pipes of "a hundred reeds" so loudly "the very mountains felt the pipings." His song is an elaborate praise-and-blame catalogue: Galatea is "fairer than the flower of snow-white privet... smoother than shells worn by continual floods" but also "wilder than all untrained bullocks, harder than seasoned oak, more treacherous than tumbled waters."[^met-cyc-song]

Polyphemus boasted of his possessions — ewes, lambs, caves, fruit trees — and defended his single eye: "I have but one eye centered perfectly within my forehead, so it seems most like a mighty buckler. Ha! does not the Sun see everything from heaven? Yet it has but one eye."[^met-cyc-eye]

He also recalled the prophecy of Telemus: "That single eye now midmost in your brow [Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md) will take from you." But Polyphemus laughed: "Most silly of the prophets! you are wrong, a maiden has already taken it!"[^met-cyc-telemus]

When he discovered Galatea with Acis, he roared: "I see you and you never will again parade your love before me!" He hurled a mountain fragment at Acis, burying him. Galatea, through her divine power, let Acis "take ancestral power of river deities." The blood became water, the rock split, and "a youth emerged, the water flowing clear about his waist, his new horns circled with entwining reeds" — Acis transformed into a river-god.[^met-cyc-acis]

### Macareus's Account (14.160-198)

In Book XIV, the Greek Achaemenides (left behind on Sicily in the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md)) recounts seeing the blinded Polyphemus: "a ghastly horror took possession of me when I saw his face and every feature streaming yet with blood, his ruthless hands, and the vile open space where his one eye had been, and his coarse limbs, and his beard matted through with human blood." He recalled Polyphemus devouring his companions — "like a lion, crouched, devouring quickly in his hideous jaws, their entrails and their flesh and their crushed bones, white marrowed, and their mangled quivering limbs."[^met-cyc-macareus]

[^met-cyc-grooming]: "Now, Polyphemus, wretched Cyclops, you are careful of appearance, and you try the art of pleasing. You have even combed your stiffened hair with rakes: it pleases you to trim your shaggy beard with sickles, while you gaze at your fierce features in a pool" (Metamorphoses 13.764-770, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-cyc-song]: "O Galatea, fairer than the flower of snow-white privet, and more blooming than the meadows... And yet, O Galatea; I must say, that you are wilder than all untrained bullocks, harder than seasoned oak, more treacherous than tumbled waters" (Metamorphoses 13.789-801, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-cyc-eye]: "I have but one eye centered perfectly within my forehead, so it seems most like a mighty buckler. Ha! does not the Sun see everything from heaven? Yet it has but one eye" (Metamorphoses 13.851-855, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-cyc-telemus]: "That single eye now midmost in your brow Ulysses will take from you... Most silly of the prophets! you are wrong, a maiden has already taken it!" (Metamorphoses 13.770-786, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-cyc-acis]: "a youth emerged, the water flowing clear about his waist, his new horns circled with entwining reeds, and the youth certainly was Acis, though he was of larger stature and his face and features all were azure" (Metamorphoses 13.885-897, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-cyc-macareus]: "a ghastly horror took possession of me when I saw his face and every feature streaming yet with blood, his ruthless hands, and the vile open space where his one eye had been, and his coarse limbs, and his beard matted through with human blood" (Metamorphoses 14.164-169, trans. Brookes More)

## In Callimachus's Hymns

### At the Forge on Lipara (Hymn III)

[Callimachus](../sources/callimachus-hymns.md)'s Hymn to Artemis includes a vivid scene of the young [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md) visiting the Cyclopes at their forge. They were at work "in the isle of Lipara – Lipara in later days, but at that time its name was Meligunis – at the anvils of Hephaestus, standing round a molten mass of iron. For a great work was being hastened on: they fashioned a horse-trough for Poseidon."[^call-cyc-lipara]

### Physical Description (Hymn III)

The nymphs travelling with Artemis were terrified by the sight: "the terrible monsters like unto the crags of Ossa: all had single eyes beneath their brows, like a shield of fourfold hide for size, glaring terribly from under; and when they heard the din of the anvil echoing loudly, and the great blast of the bellows and the heavy groaning of the Cyclopes themselves."[^call-cyc-desc] The noise was immense — Aetna, Trinacia, Italy, and Corsica all "cried aloud" when the Cyclopes "lifted their hammers above their shoulders and smote with rhythmic swing the bronze glowing from the furnace or iron, labouring greatly."[^call-cyc-noise]

This is a notably different emphasis from the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md)'s craftsmen: Callimachus foregrounds their overwhelming, terrifying physical presence rather than their skill.

### Used to Frighten Children (Hymn III)

Callimachus notes a popular function of the Cyclopes as bogeymen: "But when any of the maidens doth disobedience to her mother, the mother calls the Cyclopes to her child – Arges or Steropes; and from within the house comes Hermes, stained with burnt ashes. And straightway he plays bogey to the child, and she runs into her mother's lap, with her hands upon her eyes."[^call-cyc-bogey]

### Brontes and the Young Artemis (Hymn III)

The infant Artemis, "while yet but three years old," visited the forge. "Brontes set thee on his stout knees – thou didst pluck the shaggy hair of his great breast and tear it out by force. And even unto this day the mid part of his breast remains hairless, even when mange settles on a man's temples and eats the hair away."[^call-cyc-brontes] Artemis then commissioned her bow: "Cyclopes, for me too fashion ye a Cydonian bow and arrows and a hollow casket for my shafts; for I also am a child of Leto, even as Apollo. And if I with my bow shall slay some wild creature or monstrous beast, that shall the Cyclopes eat."[^call-cyc-bow]

[^call-cyc-lipara]: "she went to visit the Cyclopes. Them she found in the isle of Lipara – Lipara in later days, but at that time its name was Meligunis – at the anvils of Hephaestus, standing round a molten mass of iron. For a great work was being hastened on: they fashioned a horse-trough for Poseidon" (Callimachus, Hymn III to Artemis 46-49, trans. A.W. Mair, 1921)
[^call-cyc-desc]: "the terrible monsters like unto the crags of Ossa: all had single eyes beneath their brows, like a shield of fourfold hide for size, glaring terribly from under" (Hymn III 52-54)
[^call-cyc-noise]: "Aetna cried aloud, and Trinacia cried, the seat of the Sicanians, cried too their neighbour Italy, and Cyrnos therewithal uttered a mighty noise, when they lifted their hammers above their shoulders and smote with rhythmic swing the bronze glowing from the furnace or iron, labouring greatly" (Hymn III 55-60)
[^call-cyc-bogey]: "when any of the maidens doth disobedience to her mother, the mother calls the Cyclopes to her child – Arges or Steropes; and from within the house comes Hermes, stained with burnt ashes. And straightway he plays bogey to the child, and she runs into her mother's lap, with her hands upon her eyes" (Hymn III 68-73)
[^call-cyc-brontes]: "while yet but three years old, when Leto came bearing thee in her arms at the bidding of Hephaestus that he might give thee handsel and Brontes set thee on his stout knees – thou didst pluck the shaggy hair of his great breast and tear it out by force. And even unto this day the mid part of his breast remains hairless" (Hymn III 73-77)
[^call-cyc-bow]: "'Cyclopes, for me too fashion ye a Cydonian bow and arrows and a hollow casket for my shafts; for I also am a child of Leto, even as Apollo. And if I with my bow shall slay some wild creature or monstrous beast, that shall the Cyclopes eat'" (Hymn III 81-85)
