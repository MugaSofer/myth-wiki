## Overview

The **Sirens** are two creatures who "bewitch all men, whosoever shall come to them" with their singing.[^od-warning] They sit in a meadow surrounded by "a great heap of bones of men, corrupt in death," the remains of sailors lured to destruction by their voices.[^od-bones] In the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md), [Circe](../deities/circe.md) warns Odysseus of their danger and instructs him how to pass them safely.

[^od-warning]: "To the Sirens first shalt thou come, who bewitch all men, whosoever shall come to them" (Odyssey 12.48, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od-bones]: "the Sirens enchant him with their clear song, sitting in the meadow, and all about is a great heap of bones of men, corrupt in death, and round the bones the skin is wasting" (Odyssey 12.53-54, trans. Butcher and Lang)

## Powers

### Enchanting Song

The Sirens possess a voice that no man can resist unaided. [Circe](../deities/circe.md) warns that "whoso draws nigh them unwittingly and hears the sound of the Sirens' voice, never doth he see wife or babes stand by him on his return, nor have they joy at his coming."[^od-effect] Their song is described as "sweet as the honeycomb."[^od-honeycomb]

[^od-effect]: "Whoso draws nigh them unwittingly and hears the sound of the Sirens' voice, never doth he see wife or babes stand by him on his return, nor have they joy at his coming" (Odyssey 12.50-52, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od-honeycomb]: "none hath ever driven by this way in his black ship, till he hath heard from our lips the voice sweet as the honeycomb, and hath had joy thereof and gone on his way the wiser" (Odyssey 12.183-185, trans. Butcher and Lang)

### Claim of Omniscience

The Sirens claim to know all things. In their song they declare: "For lo, we know all things, all the travail that in wide Troy-land the Argives and Trojans bare by the gods' designs, yea, and we know all that shall hereafter be upon the fruitful earth."[^od-omniscience]

[^od-omniscience]: "For lo, we know all things, all the travail that in wide Troy-land the Argives and Trojans bare by the gods' designs, yea, and we know all that shall hereafter be upon the fruitful earth" (Odyssey 12.186-188, trans. Butcher and Lang)

## In the [Argonautica](../sources/argonautica.md)

### Parentage and Origin

The Argonautica gives a different parentage from the [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md): here the Sirens are daughters of Achelous and **Terpsichore** (one of the Muses), rather than Melpomene.[^arg-sir-parents] They had once "tended Demeter's noble daughter still unwed, and sang to her in chorus" before she was carried off.[^arg-sir-persephone]

### Appearance

The Argonautica gives a rare physical description: they were "fashioned in part like birds and in part like maidens to behold."[^arg-sir-form]

### Encounter with the Argo

When the Argo passed the Sirens' island, Orpheus's lyre overcame their voices and the heroes rowed past safely. Only Butes was overcome — "the goodly son of Teleon alone of the comrades leapt before them all from the polished bench into the sea... his soul melted by the clear ringing voice of the Sirens." He was rescued by [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md) (Cypris), who "in pity snatched him away, while yet in the eddies."[^arg-sir-butes]

[^arg-sir-parents]: The Sirens are daughters of Achelous and Terpsichore in the Argonautica (Argonautica 4.893-896, trans. R.C. Seaton)
[^arg-sir-persephone]: The Sirens "tended Demeter's noble daughter still unwed, and sang to her in chorus" (Argonautica 4.896-898, trans. R.C. Seaton)
[^arg-sir-form]: "fashioned in part like birds and in part like maidens to behold" (Argonautica 4.899-900, trans. R.C. Seaton)
[^arg-sir-butes]: "the goodly son of Teleon alone of the comrades leapt before them all from the polished bench into the sea, even Butes, his soul melted by the clear ringing voice of the Sirens; and he swam through the dark surge to mount the beach, poor wretch... but the goddess that rules Eryx, Cypris, in pity snatched him away, while yet in the eddies" (Argonautica 4.912-918, trans. R.C. Seaton)

## In the Odyssey

### Circe's Warning

[Circe](../deities/circe.md) warns Odysseus of the Sirens as the first danger he will face after leaving her island: "To the Sirens first shalt thou come, who bewitch all men, whosoever shall come to them."[^od-warning] She describes the meadow of bones that surrounds them[^od-bones] and provides precise instructions for safe passage: Odysseus must stop his companions' ears with wax, and if he himself wishes to hear their song, he must be bound to the mast of his ship, with orders that his men bind him tighter should he beg to be released.[^od-instructions]

[^od-instructions]: Circe instructs Odysseus to knead wax and stop his companions' ears, and to have himself bound upright to the mast, so that he may hear the Sirens' voice yet be unable to approach them (Odyssey 12.54-60, trans. Butcher and Lang)

### The Song

As Odysseus's ship draws near, the Sirens call to him by name: "Hither, come hither, renowned Odysseus, great glory of the Achaeans, here stay thy barque, that thou mayest listen to the voice of us twain."[^od-song] They appeal to his fame and his desire for knowledge, promising wisdom alongside pleasure: that none has passed without hearing their voice "sweet as the honeycomb" and going "on his way the wiser."[^od-honeycomb] They claim knowledge of all the suffering at Troy and of all that shall come to pass upon the earth.[^od-omniscience]

They are called "the Sirens twain" — there are two of them.[^od-twain]

[^od-song]: "Hither, come hither, renowned Odysseus, great glory of the Achaeans, here stay thy barque, that thou mayest listen to the voice of us twain" (Odyssey 12.181-183, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od-twain]: "the Sirens twain" (Odyssey 12.165, trans. Butcher and Lang)

### The Passage

Odysseus hears the Sirens' song bound to the mast while his crew, their ears stopped with wax, rows past. When Odysseus signals for his bonds to be loosened, his companions bind him tighter, as [Circe](../deities/circe.md) had instructed. They pass safely and the crew removes the wax from their ears only once the Sirens are well behind them.[^od-passage]

[^od-passage]: Odysseus hears the Sirens bound to the mast; his crew rows with waxed ears; when he begs to be freed they bind him tighter; they pass safely (Odyssey 12.164-196, trans. Butcher and Lang)

## In the Catalogue of Women

The Catalogue names the Sirens' island and gives their individual names: "To the island Anthemoessa (Flowery) which the son of Cronos gave them." Their names are given as Thelxiope (or Thelxinoe), Molpe, and Aglaophonus.[^cat-island] The Catalogue also says "they charmed even the winds."[^cat-winds]

[^cat-island]: "To the island Anthemoessa (Flowery) which the son of Cronos gave them. And their names are Thelxiope or Thelxinoe, Molpe and Aglaophonus" (Catalogue of Women, Fragment 47, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^cat-winds]: "Hesiod said that they charmed even the winds" (Catalogue of Women, Fragment 47, cited by scholiast, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Parentage (Bibliotheca)

Apollodorus names the Sirens' parents: "Melpomene had by Achelous the Sirens."[^apd-sirens-parents] This gives them a specific genealogy not found in the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md), where they are unnamed as to parentage. Their mother is Melpomene (the [Muse](../deities/muses.md) of tragedy), and their father is Achelous (the river god).

[^apd-sirens-parents]: "Melpomene had by Achelous the Sirens" (Bibliotheca 1.3.4, trans. Frazer)

## In the Fabulae

The [Fabulae](../sources/hyginus.md) gives a unique origin story for the Sirens' nature and a prophecy about their fate.

### Origin and Transformation

"The Sirens, daughter of the River Achelous and the Muse Melpomene, wandering away after the rape of Proserpina, came to the land of Apollo, and there were made flying creatures by the will of Ceres because they had not brought help to her daughter."[^hyg-141-origin]

This presents them as originally companions of [Persephone](../deities/persephone.md) (Proserpina) who failed to prevent her abduction by [Hades](../deities/hades.md) (Pluto). [Demeter](../deities/demeter.md) (Ceres) punished them by transforming them into "flying creatures" — presumably birds or bird-women.

### The Prophecy

"It was predicted that they would live only until someone who heard their singing would pass by."[^hyg-141-prophecy] This prophecy explains their vulnerability: they are fated to die when a listener escapes.

### Death

"Ulysses proved fatal to them, for when by his cleverness he passed by the rocks where they dwelt, they threw themselves into the sea."[^hyg-141-death] The Fabulae thus records the Sirens' death following Odysseus's (Ulysses') passage — they committed suicide by drowning.

"This place is called Sirenides from them, and is between Sicily and Italy."[^hyg-141-place]

[^hyg-141-origin]: "The Sirens, daughter of the River Achelous and the Muse Melpomene, wandering away after the rape of Proserpina, came to the land of Apollo, and there were made flying creatures by the will of Ceres because they had not brought help to her daughter" (Fabulae §141, trans. Mary Grant)
