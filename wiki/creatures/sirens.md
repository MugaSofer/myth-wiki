## Overview

The **Sirens** are two creatures who "bewitch all men, whosoever shall come to them" with their singing.[^od-warning] They sit in a meadow surrounded by "a great heap of bones of men, corrupt in death," the remains of sailors lured to destruction by their voices.[^od-bones] In the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md), [Circe](../deities/circe.md) warns Odysseus of their danger and instructs him how to pass them safely.

[^od-warning]: "To the Sirens first shalt thou come, who bewitch all men, whosoever shall come to them" (Odyssey XII.6573, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od-bones]: "the Sirens enchant him with their clear song, sitting in the meadow, and all about is a great heap of bones of men, corrupt in death, and round the bones the skin is wasting" (Odyssey XII.6578-6579, trans. Butcher and Lang)

## Powers

### Enchanting Song

The Sirens possess a voice that no man can resist unaided. [Circe](../deities/circe.md) warns that "whoso draws nigh them unwittingly and hears the sound of the Sirens' voice, never doth he see wife or babes stand by him on his return, nor have they joy at his coming."[^od-effect] Their song is described as "sweet as the honeycomb."[^od-honeycomb]

[^od-effect]: "Whoso draws nigh them unwittingly and hears the sound of the Sirens' voice, never doth he see wife or babes stand by him on his return, nor have they joy at his coming" (Odyssey XII.6575-6577, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od-honeycomb]: "none hath ever driven by this way in his black ship, till he hath heard from our lips the voice sweet as the honeycomb, and hath had joy thereof and gone on his way the wiser" (Odyssey XII.6707-6709, trans. Butcher and Lang)

### Claim of Omniscience

The Sirens claim to know all things. In their song they declare: "For lo, we know all things, all the travail that in wide Troy-land the Argives and Trojans bare by the gods' designs, yea, and we know all that shall hereafter be upon the fruitful earth."[^od-omniscience]

[^od-omniscience]: "For lo, we know all things, all the travail that in wide Troy-land the Argives and Trojans bare by the gods' designs, yea, and we know all that shall hereafter be upon the fruitful earth" (Odyssey XII.6710-6712, trans. Butcher and Lang)

## In the Odyssey

### Circe's Warning

[Circe](../deities/circe.md) warns Odysseus of the Sirens as the first danger he will face after leaving her island: "To the Sirens first shalt thou come, who bewitch all men, whosoever shall come to them."[^od-warning] She describes the meadow of bones that surrounds them[^od-bones] and provides precise instructions for safe passage: Odysseus must stop his companions' ears with wax, and if he himself wishes to hear their song, he must be bound to the mast of his ship, with orders that his men bind him tighter should he beg to be released.[^od-instructions]

[^od-instructions]: Circe instructs Odysseus to knead wax and stop his companions' ears, and to have himself bound upright to the mast, so that he may hear the Sirens' voice yet be unable to approach them (Odyssey XII.6579-6585, trans. Butcher and Lang)

### The Song

As Odysseus's ship draws near, the Sirens call to him by name: "Hither, come hither, renowned Odysseus, great glory of the Achaeans, here stay thy barque, that thou mayest listen to the voice of us twain."[^od-song] They appeal to his fame and his desire for knowledge, promising wisdom alongside pleasure: that none has passed without hearing their voice "sweet as the honeycomb" and going "on his way the wiser."[^od-honeycomb] They claim knowledge of all the suffering at Troy and of all that shall come to pass upon the earth.[^od-omniscience]

They are called "the Sirens twain" — there are two of them.[^od-twain]

[^od-song]: "Hither, come hither, renowned Odysseus, great glory of the Achaeans, here stay thy barque, that thou mayest listen to the voice of us twain" (Odyssey XII.6705-6707, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od-twain]: "the Sirens twain" (Odyssey XII.6689, trans. Butcher and Lang)

### The Passage

Odysseus hears the Sirens' song bound to the mast while his crew, their ears stopped with wax, rows past. When Odysseus signals for his bonds to be loosened, his companions bind him tighter, as [Circe](../deities/circe.md) had instructed. They pass safely and the crew removes the wax from their ears only once the Sirens are well behind them.[^od-passage]

[^od-passage]: Odysseus hears the Sirens bound to the mast; his crew rows with waxed ears; when he begs to be freed they bind him tighter; they pass safely (Odyssey XII.6688-6720, trans. Butcher and Lang)

## Parentage (Bibliotheca)

Apollodorus names the Sirens' parents: "Melpomene had by Achelous the Sirens."[^apd-sirens-parents] This gives them a specific genealogy not found in the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md), where they are unnamed as to parentage. Their mother is Melpomene (the [Muse](../deities/muses.md) of tragedy), and their father is Achelous (the river god).

[^apd-sirens-parents]: "Melpomene had by Achelous the Sirens" (Bibliotheca 1.3.4, trans. Frazer)
