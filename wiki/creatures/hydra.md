## Overview

The **Hydra of Lerna** was a monster nourished by [Hera](../deities/hera.md) in her anger against [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md), and ultimately destroyed by him.

## Mythology

"She bore a third, the evil-minded Hydra of Lerna, whom the goddess, white-armed [Hera](../deities/hera.md) nourished, being angry beyond measure with the mighty [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md). And her Heracles, the son of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md), of the house of Amphitryon, together with warlike Iolaus, destroyed with the unpitying sword through the plans of [Athena](../deities/athena.md) the spoil-driver."[^theog-hydra]

[^theog-hydra]: "And again she bore a third, the evil-minded Hydra of Lerna, whom the goddess, white-armed Hera nourished, being angry beyond measure with the mighty Heracles. And her Heracles, the son of Zeus, of the house of Amphitryon, together with warlike Iolaus, destroyed with the unpitying sword through the plans of Athene the spoil-driver." (Theogony 313-318, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## In the Bibliotheca (2.5.2)

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) provides the fullest account of the Hydra and the second labour of [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md). The creature was "bred in the swamp of Lerna" and "used to go forth into the plain and ravage both the cattle and the country."[^apd-hydra-lair]

Its physical form is precisely described: "the hydra had a huge body, with nine heads, eight mortal, but the middle one immortal."[^apd-hydra-desc]

Heracles came to Lerna on a chariot driven by Iolaus, forced the Hydra out with fiery shafts, and seized it. "But the hydra wound itself about one of his feet and clung to him. Nor could he effect anything by smashing its heads with his club, for as fast as one head was smashed there grew up two."[^apd-hydra-regen] A giant crab also came to the Hydra's aid by biting Heracles' foot. Iolaus helped by "setting fire to a piece of the neighboring wood and burning the roots of the heads with the brands," which prevented them from sprouting. Heracles then "chopped off the immortal head, and buried it, and put a heavy rock on it."[^apd-hydra-defeat]

The Hydra's venom proved useful afterwards: "the body of the hydra he slit up and dipped his arrows in the gall."[^apd-hydra-gall] However, Eurystheus refused to count this labour "because he had not got the better of the hydra by himself, but with the help of Iolaus."[^apd-hydra-reject]

[^apd-hydra-lair]: "That creature, bred in the swamp of Lerna, used to go forth into the plain and ravage both the cattle and the country." (Bibliotheca 2.5.2, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-hydra-desc]: "the hydra had a huge body, with nine heads, eight mortal, but the middle one immortal" (Bibliotheca 2.5.2, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-hydra-regen]: "the hydra wound itself about one of his feet and clung to him. Nor could he effect anything by smashing its heads with his club, for as fast as one head was smashed there grew up two." (Bibliotheca 2.5.2)
[^apd-hydra-defeat]: "Having thus got the better of the sprouting heads, he chopped off the immortal head, and buried it, and put a heavy rock on it, beside the road that leads through Lerna to Elaeus." (Bibliotheca 2.5.2)
[^apd-hydra-gall]: "the body of the hydra he slit up and dipped his arrows in the gall" (Bibliotheca 2.5.2, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-hydra-reject]: "Eurystheus said that this labour should not be reckoned among the ten because he had not got the better of the hydra by himself, but with the help of Iolaus." (Bibliotheca 2.5.2)
