## Mythology

"She bore a third, the evil-minded Hydra of Lerna, whom the goddess, white-armed [Hera](../deities/hera.md) nourished, being angry beyond measure with the mighty [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md). And her Heracles, the son of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md), of the house of Amphitryon, together with warlike Iolaus, destroyed with the unpitying sword through the plans of [Athena](../deities/athena.md) the spoil-driver."[^theog-hydra]

[^theog-hydra]: "And again she bore a third, the evil-minded Hydra of Lerna, whom the goddess, white-armed Hera nourished, being angry beyond measure with the mighty Heracles. And her Heracles, the son of Zeus, of the house of Amphitryon, together with warlike Iolaus, destroyed with the unpitying sword through the plans of Athene the spoil-driver."
