## Overview

**Typhoeus** was the last and most terrible monster to challenge [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md)'s rule. Born of [Gaia](../deities/gaia.md) and [Tartarus](../places/tartarus.md) after the [Titanomachy](../events/titanomachy.md), he nearly overthrew the gods before Zeus defeated him.

## Description

"Strength was with his hands in all that he did and the feet of the strong god were untiring. From his shoulders grew an hundred heads of a snake, a fearful dragon, with dark, flickering tongues, and from under the brows of his eyes in his marvellous heads flashed fire, and fire burned from his heads as he glared."[^theog-desc]

His voices were extraordinary: "at one time they made sounds such that the gods understood, but at another, the noise of a bull bellowing aloud in proud ungovernable fury; and at another, the sound of a lion, relentless of heart; and at another, sounds like whelps, wonderful to hear; and again, at another, he would hiss, so that the high mountains re-echoed."[^theog-voices]

## Mythology

### Battle with Zeus

"Truly a thing past help would have happened on that day, and he would have come to reign over mortals and immortals, had not the father of men and gods been quick to perceive it."[^theog-threat]

Zeus fought him directly: "he thundered hard and mightily... Great [Olympus](../places/olympus.md) reeled beneath the divine feet of the king as he arose and earth groaned thereat."[^theog-battle] The combat affected the entire cosmos: "[Hades](../deities/hades.md) trembled where he rules over the dead below, and the [Titans](../deities/titans.md) under [Tartarus](../places/tartarus.md) who live with [Cronos](../deities/cronos.md), because of the unending clamour."[^theog-cosmic]

Zeus "leaped from Olympus and struck him, and burned all the marvellous heads of the monster about him." Typhoeus "was hurled down, a maimed wreck, so that the huge earth groaned" and "a great part of huge earth was scorched by the terrible vapour and melted as tin melts."[^theog-defeat] Zeus cast him into [Tartarus](../places/tartarus.md).[^theog-cast]

[^theog-threat]: "And truly a thing past help would have happened on that day, and he would have come to reign over mortals and immortals, had not the father of men and gods been quick to perceive it." (Theogony 836-838)
[^theog-battle]: "But he thundered hard and mightily: and the earth around resounded terribly and the wide heaven above, and the sea and Ocean's streams and the nether parts of the earth. Great Olympus reeled beneath the divine feet of the king as he arose and earth groaned thereat." (Theogony 839-843)
[^theog-cosmic]: "Hades trembled where he rules over the dead below, and the Titans under Tartarus who live with Cronos, because of the unending clamour and the fearful strife." (Theogony 850-852)
[^theog-defeat]: "he leaped from Olympus and struck him, and burned all the marvellous heads of the monster about him. But when Zeus had conquered him and lashed him with strokes, Typhoeus was hurled down, a maimed wreck, so that the huge earth groaned." ... "A great part of huge earth was scorched by the terrible vapour and melted as tin melts" (Theogony 855-862)
[^theog-cast]: "And in the bitterness of his anger Zeus cast him into wide Tartarus." (Theogony 868)

### Origin of Destructive Winds

"From Typhoeus come boisterous winds which blow damply," excluding the beneficial Notus, Boreas, and Zephyr (which are divine). The destructive winds from Typhoeus "rush upon the misty sea and work great havoc among men" and "over the boundless, flowering earth spoil the fair fields of men."[^theog-winds]

[^theog-winds]: "And from Typhoeus come boisterous winds which blow damply, except Notus and Boreas and clear Zephyr." ... "Some rush upon the misty sea and work great havoc among men" ... "Others again over the boundless, flowering earth spoil the fair fields of men who dwell below, filling them with dust and cruel uproar." (Theogony 869-880)

## Children

With [Echidna](echidna.md), Typhoeus (called "Typhaon" in this passage) fathered Orthus, [Cerberus](cerberus.md), the Hydra of Lerna, and the [Chimaera](chimaera.md).[^theog-children]

[^theog-children]: "Men say that Typhaon the terrible, outrageous and lawless, was joined in love to her, the maid with glancing eyes. So she conceived and brought forth fierce offspring" (Theogony 306-325)
