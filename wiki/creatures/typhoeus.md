## Overview

**Typhoeus** was the last and most terrible monster to challenge [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md)'s rule. Born of [Gaia](../deities/gaia.md) and [Tartarus](../places/tartarus.md) after the [Titanomachy](../events/titanomachy.md), he nearly overthrew the gods before Zeus defeated him.

## Description

"Strength was with his hands in all that he did and the feet of the strong god were untiring. From his shoulders grew an hundred heads of a snake, a fearful dragon, with dark, flickering tongues, and from under the brows of his eyes in his marvellous heads flashed fire, and fire burned from his heads as he glared."[^theog-desc]

His voices were extraordinary: "at one time they made sounds such that the gods understood, but at another, the noise of a bull bellowing aloud in proud ungovernable fury; and at another, the sound of a lion, relentless of heart; and at another, sounds like whelps, wonderful to hear; and again, at another, he would hiss, so that the high mountains re-echoed."[^theog-voices]

[^theog-desc]: "Strength was with his hands in all that he did and the feet of the strong god were untiring. From his shoulders grew an hundred heads of a snake, a fearful dragon, with dark, flickering tongues, and from under the brows of his eyes in his marvellous heads flashed fire, and fire burned from his heads as he glared." (Theogony 823-828, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

(Theogony 829-835)

## Mythology

### Battle with Zeus

"Truly a thing past help would have happened on that day, and he would have come to reign over mortals and immortals, had not the father of men and gods been quick to perceive it."[^theog-threat]

Zeus fought him directly: "he thundered hard and mightily... Great [Olympus](../places/olympus.md) reeled beneath the divine feet of the king as he arose and earth groaned thereat."[^theog-battle] The combat affected the entire cosmos: "[Hades](../deities/hades.md) trembled where he rules over the dead below, and the [Titans](../deities/titans.md) under [Tartarus](../places/tartarus.md) who live with [Cronos](../deities/cronos.md), because of the unending clamour."[^theog-cosmic]

Zeus "leaped from Olympus and struck him, and burned all the marvellous heads of the monster about him." Typhoeus "was hurled down, a maimed wreck, so that the huge earth groaned" and "a great part of huge earth was scorched by the terrible vapour and melted as tin melts."[^theog-defeat] Zeus cast him into [Tartarus](../places/tartarus.md).[^theog-cast]

[^theog-threat]: "And truly a thing past help would have happened on that day, and he would have come to reign over mortals and immortals, had not the father of men and gods been quick to perceive it." (Theogony 836-838)
[^theog-battle]: "But he thundered hard and mightily: and the earth around resounded terribly and the wide heaven above, and the sea and Ocean's streams and the nether parts of the earth. Great Olympus reeled beneath the divine feet of the king as he arose and earth groaned thereat." (Theogony 839-843)
[^theog-cosmic]: "Hades trembled where he rules over the dead below, and the Titans under Tartarus who live with Cronos, because of the unending clamour and the fearful strife." (Theogony 850-852)
[^theog-defeat]: "he leaped from Olympus and struck him, and burned all the marvellous heads of the monster about him. But when Zeus had conquered him and lashed him with strokes, Typhoeus was hurled down, a maimed wreck, so that the huge earth groaned." ... "A great part of huge earth was scorched by the terrible vapour and melted as tin melts" (Theogony 855-862)
[^theog-cast]: "And in the bitterness of his anger Zeus cast him into wide Tartarus." (Theogony 868)

### Origin of Destructive Winds

"From Typhoeus come boisterous winds which blow damply," excluding the beneficial Notus, Boreas, and Zephyr (which are divine). The destructive winds from Typhoeus "rush upon the misty sea and work great havoc among men" and "over the boundless, flowering earth spoil the fair fields of men."[^theog-winds]

[^theog-winds]: "And from Typhoeus come boisterous winds which blow damply, except Notus and Boreas and clear Zephyr." ... "Some rush upon the misty sea and work great havoc among men" ... "Others again over the boundless, flowering earth spoil the fair fields of men who dwell below, filling them with dust and cruel uproar." (Theogony 869-880)

## Children

With [Echidna](echidna.md), Typhoeus (called "Typhaon" in this passage) fathered Orthus, [Cerberus](cerberus.md), the Hydra of Lerna, and the [Chimaera](chimaera.md).[^theog-children]

[^theog-children]: "Men say that Typhaon the terrible, outrageous and lawless, was joined in love to her, the maid with glancing eyes. So she conceived and brought forth fierce offspring" (Theogony 306-325)

## In the Bibliotheca

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) provides a substantially expanded narrative of Typhoeus, with many details not found in the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md).

### Birth and Description

After the gods overcame the [Giants](giants.md), [Gaia](../deities/gaia.md) "had intercourse with Tartarus and brought forth Typhon in Cilicia, a hybrid between man and beast."[^apd-typh-birth] His description is far more detailed than in Hesiod: "As far as the thighs he was of human shape and of such prodigious bulk that he out-topped all the mountains, and his head often brushed the stars. One of his hands reached out to the west and the other to the east, and from them projected a hundred dragons' heads."[^apd-typh-desc1] "From the thighs downward he had huge coils of vipers, which when drawn out, reached to his very head and emitted a loud hissing. His body was all winged: unkempt hair streamed on the wind from his head and cheeks; and fire flashed from his eyes."[^apd-typh-desc2]

> **VARIANT vs Theogony:** In the Theogony, Typhoeus has a hundred snake heads on his *shoulders*, and multiple voices. In the Bibliotheca, he is human to the thighs, with dragon heads projecting from his *hands*, viper coils for legs, and a winged body. The Bibliotheca's description is more anthropomorphic yet more detailed.

### The Flight of the Gods

When Typhon attacked heaven "hurling kindled rocks... with hissings and shouts, spouting a great jet of fire from his mouth," the gods "made for Egypt in flight, and being pursued they changed their forms into those of animals."[^apd-typh-egypt]

### Zeus's First Attack and Defeat

[Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) attacked with [thunderbolts](../objects/thunderbolt.md) at a distance, then struck with "an adamantine sickle" at close range. He pursued Typhon to Mount Casius in Syria. But Typhon "twined about him and gripped him in his coils, and wresting the sickle from him severed the sinews of his hands and feet, and lifting him on his shoulders carried him through the sea to Cilicia and deposited him on arrival in the Corycian cave."[^apd-typh-sinews]

He "put away the sinews there also, hidden in a bearskin, and he set to guard them the she-dragon Delphyne, who was a half-bestial maiden."[^apd-typh-delphyne]

### Recovery and Victory

[Hermes](../deities/hermes.md) and Aegipan "stole the sinews and fitted them unobserved to Zeus."[^apd-typh-hermes] Zeus recovered his strength and, "riding in a chariot of winged horses, pelted Typhon with thunderbolts and pursued him to the mountain called Nysa, where the [Fates](../deities/fates.md) beguiled the fugitive; for he tasted of the ephemeral fruits in the persuasion that he would be strengthened thereby."[^apd-typh-fates]

Typhon came to Thrace, "and in fighting at Mount Haemus he heaved whole mountains. But when these recoiled on him through the force of the thunderbolt, a stream of blood gushed out on the mountain, and they say that from that circumstance the mountain was called Haemus."[^apd-typh-haemus] Finally, "when he started to flee through the Sicilian sea, Zeus cast Mount Etna in Sicily upon him."[^apd-typh-etna]

> **VARIANT vs Theogony:** In Hesiod, Zeus casts Typhoeus into Tartarus. In the Bibliotheca, Zeus casts Mount Etna upon him in Sicily — explaining the volcano's fires as coming from "the thunderbolts that were thrown."

[^apd-typh-birth]: "Earth, still more enraged, had intercourse with Tartarus and brought forth Typhon in Cilicia, a hybrid between man and beast. In size and strength he surpassed all the offspring of Earth." (Bibliotheca 1.6.3, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-typh-desc1]: "As far as the thighs he was of human shape and of such prodigious bulk that he out-topped all the mountains, and his head often brushed the stars. One of his hands reached out to the west and the other to the east, and from them projected a hundred dragons' heads." (Bibliotheca 1.6.3, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-typh-desc2]: "From the thighs downward he had huge coils of vipers, which when drawn out, reached to his very head and emitted a loud hissing. His body was all winged: unkempt hair streamed on the wind from his head and cheeks; and fire flashed from his eyes." (Bibliotheca 1.6.3, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-typh-egypt]: "when the gods saw him rushing at heaven, they made for Egypt in flight, and being pursued they changed their forms into those of animals." (Bibliotheca 1.6.3, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-typh-sinews]: "Typhon twined about him and gripped him in his coils, and wresting the sickle from him severed the sinews of his hands and feet, and lifting him on his shoulders carried him through the sea to Cilicia and deposited him on arrival in the Corycian cave." (Bibliotheca 1.6.3, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-typh-delphyne]: "Likewise he put away the sinews there also, hidden in a bearskin, and he set to guard them the she-dragon Delphyne, who was a half-bestial maiden." (Bibliotheca 1.6.3, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-typh-hermes]: "But Hermes and Aegipan stole the sinews and fitted them unobserved to Zeus." (Bibliotheca 1.6.3, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-typh-fates]: "Zeus suddenly from heaven, riding in a chariot of winged horses, pelted Typhon with thunderbolts and pursued him to the mountain called Nysa, where the Fates beguiled the fugitive; for he tasted of the ephemeral fruits in the persuasion that he would be strengthened thereby." (Bibliotheca 1.6.3, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-typh-haemus]: "in fighting at Mount Haemus he heaved whole mountains. But when these recoiled on him through the force of the thunderbolt, a stream of blood gushed out on the mountain, and they say that from that circumstance the mountain was called Haemus." (Bibliotheca 1.6.3, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-typh-etna]: "when he started to flee through the Sicilian sea, Zeus cast Mount Etna in Sicily upon him. That is a huge mountain, from which down to this day they say that blasts of fire issue from the thunderbolts that were thrown." (Bibliotheca 1.6.3, trans. Frazer)

## In the Fabulae

The [Fabulae](../sources/hyginus.md) gives a brief account emphasizing Typhoeus's parentage and final location.

"Tartarus begat by Tartara, Typhon, a creature of immense size and fearful shape, who had a hundred dragon heads springing from his shoulders."[^hyg-152-desc] This differs from the Theogony (which names [Gaia](../deities/gaia.md) as mother) and presents both parents as forms of [Tartarus](../places/tartarus.md) itself.

"He challenged Jove to see if Jove would content with him for the rule."[^hyg-152-challenge] The battle was decisive: "Jove struck his breast with a flaming thunderbolt. When it was burning him he put Mount Etna, which is in Sicily, over him. From this it is said to burn still."[^hyg-152-etna]

> **VARIANT:** Like the Bibliotheca but unlike the Theogony, the Fabulae places Typhoeus under Mount Etna rather than in Tartarus, explaining the volcano's eternal fires.

[^hyg-152-desc]: "Tartarus begat by Tartara, Typhon, a creature of immense size and fearful shape, who had a hundred dragon heads springing from his shoulders" (Fabulae §152, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-152-challenge]: "He challenged Jove to see if Jove would content with him for the rule" (Fabulae §152, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-152-etna]: "Jove struck his breast with a flaming thunderbolt. When it was burning him he put Mount Etna, which is in Sicily, over him. From this it is said to burn still" (Fabulae §152, trans. Mary Grant)

## In Aeschylus' [Prometheus Bound](../sources/aeschylus-prometheus-bound.md)

[Prometheus](../deities/prometheus.md) recounts seeing "Earth's child, the monstrous thing of war, that in Cilicia's hollow places dwelt — Typho." He calls him "hundred-headed" and describes: "his jaws gaped horror and their hiss was death, and all heaven's host he challenged to the fray, while, as one vowed to storm the power of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md), forth from his eyes he shot a demon glare."[^pb-typh-desc]

The defeat is emphatic: "the unsleeping bolt of Zeus, the downward levin with its rush of flame, smote on him, and made dumb for evermore the clamour of his vaunting: to the heart stricken he lay, and all that mould of strength sank thunder-shattered to a smouldering ash." Now "helpless... he lieth by the narrow strait of sea, crushed at the root of Etna's mountain-pile."[^pb-typh-defeat]

Prometheus adds that [Hephaestus](../deities/hephaestus.md) sits forging "high on the pinnacles" of Etna, and predicts that "on some hereafter day shall burst and stream the lava-floods, that shall with ravening fangs gnaw thy smooth lowlands, fertile Sicily!"[^pb-typh-etna]

[^pb-typh-desc]: "Earth's child, the monstrous thing of war, that in Cilicia's hollow places dwelt — Typho; I saw his hundred-headed form... his jaws gaped horror and their hiss was death, and all heaven's host he challenged to the fray" (Prometheus Bound ~355-363, trans. E.D.A. Morshead)
[^pb-typh-defeat]: "the unsleeping bolt of Zeus, the downward levin with its rush of flame, smote on him... to the heart stricken he lay, and all that mould of strength sank thunder-shattered to a smouldering ash; and helpless now and laid in ruin huge he lieth by the narrow strait of sea, crushed at the root of Etna's mountain-pile" (Prometheus Bound ~363-375, trans. E.D.A. Morshead)
[^pb-typh-etna]: "High on the pinnacles whereof there sits Hephaestus, sweltering at the forge; and thence on some hereafter day shall burst and stream the lava-floods" (Prometheus Bound ~375-380, trans. E.D.A. Morshead)
