## Overview

**Pegasus** is a winged horse who sprang from the neck of [Medusa](gorgons.md) when [Perseus](../heroes/perseus.md) cut off her head.

## Birth

"When Perseus cut off her head, there sprang forth great Chrysaor and the horse Pegasus who is so called because he was born near the springs (*pegae*) of Ocean."[^theog-birth]

[^theog-birth]: "when Perseus cut off her head, there sprang forth great Chrysaor and the horse Pegasus who is so called because he was born near the springs (pegae) of Ocean; and that other, because he held a golden blade (aor) in his hands" (Theogony 280-283, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Mythology

"Pegasus flew away and left the earth, the mother of flocks, and came to the deathless gods: and he dwells in the house of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) and brings to wise Zeus the thunder and lightning."[^theog-role]

He also slew the [Chimaera](chimaera.md) alongside Bellerophon: "Her did Pegasus and noble Bellerophon slay."[^theog-chimaera]
