## Overview

**Pegasus** is a winged horse who sprang from the neck of [Medusa](gorgons.md) when [Perseus](../heroes/perseus.md) cut off her head.

## Birth

"When Perseus cut off her head, there sprang forth great Chrysaor and the horse Pegasus who is so called because he was born near the springs (*pegae*) of Ocean."[^theog-birth]

[^theog-birth]: "when Perseus cut off her head, there sprang forth great Chrysaor and the horse Pegasus who is so called because he was born near the springs (pegae) of Ocean; and that other, because he held a golden blade (aor) in his hands" (Theogony 280-283, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Mythology

"Pegasus flew away and left the earth, the mother of flocks, and came to the deathless gods: and he dwells in the house of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) and brings to wise Zeus the thunder and lightning."[^theog-role]

He also slew the [Chimaera](chimaera.md) alongside Bellerophon: "Her did Pegasus and noble Bellerophon slay."[^theog-chimaera]

[^theog-role]: "Now Pegasus flew away and left the earth, the mother of flocks, and came to the deathless gods: and he dwells in the house of Zeus and brings to wise Zeus the thunder and lightning" (Theogony 284-286)
[^theog-chimaera]: "Her did Pegasus and noble Bellerophon slay" (Theogony 325)

## In the Bibliotheca

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) confirms Pegasus's parentage and birth in two passages. First, Bellerophon "mounted his winged steed Pegasus, offspring of Medusa and [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md), and soaring on high shot down the [Chimaera](chimaera.md) from the height."[^apd-peg-bellero]

Later, when [Perseus](../heroes/perseus.md) beheaded [Medusa](gorgons.md), "there sprang from the Gorgon the winged horse Pegasus and Chrysaor, the father of Geryon; these she had by [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md)."[^apd-peg-birth]

> **NOTE:** The Bibliotheca explicitly names [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) as father, matching the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md)'s "the Dark-haired One." It also confirms that Pegasus sprang from the severed head of Medusa alongside Chrysaor.

[^apd-peg-bellero]: "mounted his winged steed Pegasus, offspring of Medusa and Poseidon, and soaring on high shot down the Chimera from the height" (Bibliotheca 2.3.2, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-peg-birth]: "there sprang from the Gorgon the winged horse Pegasus and Chrysaor, the father of Geryon; these she had by Poseidon." (Bibliotheca 2.4.2, trans. J.G. Frazer)
