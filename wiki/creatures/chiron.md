## Overview

**Chiron** is a centaur of unique origin and character, born of [Cronos](../deities/cronos.md) and the Oceanid Philyra. Unlike other centaurs, he is consistently described as wise, righteous, and skilled in medicine and hunting. He served as teacher and foster-father to several of the greatest heroes, including Achilles, Asclepius, Jason, and Actaeon.

## In the [Argonautica](../sources/argonautica.md)

### Birth from Cronos and Philyra

The Argonautica gives the fullest narrative of Chiron's conception. "[Cronos](../deities/cronos.md), son of Uranus... lay beside Philyra, when he had deceived [Rhea](../deities/rhea.md); and the goddess found them in the midst of their dalliance; and Cronos leapt up from the couch with a rush in the form of a steed." Philyra consequently bore "huge Cheiron, half like a horse, half like a god."[^arg-chiron-birth]

### Farewell at the Argo's Departure

When the Argo set sail from Iolcus, Chiron came down to the shore carrying the infant [Achilles](../heroes/achilles.md) to show to his father [Peleus](../heroes/peleus.md) as the ship departed.[^arg-chiron-farewell]

[^arg-chiron-birth]: "Cronos, son of Uranus... lay beside Philyra, when he had deceived Rhea; and the goddess found them in the midst of their dalliance; and Cronos leapt up from the couch with a rush in the form of a steed... and she bare huge Cheiron, half like a horse, half like a god" (Argonautica 2.1231-1241, trans. R.C. Seaton)
[^arg-chiron-farewell]: Chiron came to the sea-shore bearing infant Achilles to show to Peleus as the Argo departed (Argonautica 1.553-558, trans. R.C. Seaton)

## Parentage and Origin

Chiron's origin is distinctive among the centaurs: he was born from the union of [Cronos](../deities/cronos.md) and Philyra, "daughter of Ocean." The [Epic Cycle](../sources/epic-cycle.md) (War of the Titans) explains that "Cronos took the shape of a horse and lay with Philyra, the daughter of Ocean. Through this cause Cheiron was born a centaur: his wife was Chariclo."[^titan-origin] Apollodorus confirms: "to Cronus and Philyra was born Chiron, a centaur of double form."[^apd-parentage]

The Hesiodic Catalogue of Women also identifies him as "Cheiron the son of Philyra."[^cat-philyra]

[^titan-origin]: "Cronos took the shape of a horse and lay with Philyra, the daughter of Ocean. Through this cause Cheiron was born a centaur: his wife was Chariclo" (War of the Titans, Fragment 6, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^apd-parentage]: "to Cronus and Philyra was born Chiron, a centaur of double form" (Bibliotheca 1.2.4, trans. Frazer)
[^cat-philyra]: "Cheiron the son of Philyra brought up in the mountains" (Catalogue of Women, Fragment, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Character

In the Iliad, Chiron is called "the most righteous of the Centaurs" — Eurypylos asks Patroklos for healing herbs "whereof they say that thou hast learned from Achilles, whom Cheiron taught, the most righteous of the Centaurs."[^il11-righteous]

[^il11-righteous]: "these good herbs whereof they say that thou hast learned from Achilles, whom Cheiron taught, the most righteous of the Centaurs" (Iliad XI.6941-6943, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

## As Teacher

### Achilles

Chiron's most prominent role across the sources is as the teacher and foster-father of [Achilles](../heroes/achilles.md). In the Iliad, Chiron taught medicine that passed through a chain from himself to Achilles to Patroklos: Machaon treats Menelaos with "soothing drugs, such as Cheiron of his good will had imparted to his sire."[^il4-medicine] In Book XI, Eurypylos asks Patroklos for these same healing arts, learned "from Achilles, whom Cheiron taught."[^il11-righteous]

Apollodorus gives the fullest account. After [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md) abandoned infant Achilles, "Peleus brought the child to Chiron, who received him and fed him on the inwards of lions and wild swine and the marrows of bears, and named him Achilles, because he had not put his lips to the breast; but before that time his name was Ligyron."[^apd-achilles-rearing]

The Hesiodic Catalogue confirms: "Chiron was tending the son of Peleus, swift-footed Achilles, pre-eminent among men, on woody Pelion; for he was still a boy."[^cat-achilles]

[^il4-medicine]: "cunningly spread thereon soothing drugs, such as Cheiron of his good will had imparted to his sire" (Iliad IV.2272-2274, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^apd-achilles-rearing]: "Peleus brought the child to Chiron, who received him and fed him on the inwards of lions and wild swine and the marrows of bears, and named him Achilles, because he had not put his lips to the breast; but before that time his name was Ligyron" (Bibliotheca 3.13.6, trans. Frazer)
[^cat-achilles]: "But Chiron was tending the son of Peleus, swift-footed Achilles, pre-eminent among men, on woody Pelion; for he was still a boy" (Catalogue of Women, ll. 100-106, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

### Asclepius

Apollo "snatched the babe from the pyre and brought it to Chiron, the centaur, by whom he was brought up and taught the arts of healing and hunting."[^apd-asclepius] This makes Chiron the original source of human medicine in the Greek tradition — both the Iliad's chain of medical knowledge (Chiron to Achilles to Patroklos) and Asclepius's divine surgical skill derive from him.

[^apd-asclepius]: "he snatched the babe from the pyre and brought it to Chiron, the centaur, by whom he was brought up and taught the arts of healing and hunting" (Bibliotheca 3.10.3, trans. Frazer)

### Jason

The Hesiodic tradition records that Jason was also Chiron's pupil: "Aeson, who begot a son Iason, shepherd of the people, whom Chiron brought up in woody Pelion."[^cat-jason]

[^cat-jason]: "Aeson, who begot a son Iason, shepherd of the people, whom Chiron brought up in woody Pelion" (Catalogue of Women, Fragment, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

### Actaeon

"Autonoe and Aristaeus had a son Actaeon, who was bred by Chiron to be a hunter."[^apd-actaeon] After Actaeon was devoured by his own dogs, they "sought their master howling lamentably, and in the search they came to the cave of Chiron, who fashioned an image of Actaeon, which soothed their grief."[^apd-actaeon-image]

[^apd-actaeon]: "Autonoe and Aristaeus had a son Actaeon, who was bred by Chiron to be a hunter" (Bibliotheca 3.4.4, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-actaeon-image]: "in the search they came to the cave of Chiron, who fashioned an image of Actaeon, which soothed their grief" (Bibliotheca 3.4.4, trans. Frazer)

### Phoenix

Peleus "brought him to Chiron, who restored his sight, and thereupon Peleus made him king of the Dolopians."[^apd-phoenix]

[^apd-phoenix]: "Peleus brought him to Chiron, who restored his sight, and thereupon Peleus made him king of the Dolopians" (Bibliotheca 3.13.8, trans. Frazer)

### Medeus

Chiron raised Medeus, son of Jason and Medea: "bare a son Medeus whom Cheiron the son of Philyra brought up in the mountains."[^cat-medeus]

[^cat-medeus]: "bare a son Medeus whom Cheiron the son of Philyra brought up in the mountains" (Catalogue of Women, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## The Pelian Spear

Chiron gave Peleus the famous ash-wood spear at his wedding to [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md). The [Epic Cycle](../sources/epic-cycle.md) (Cypria) records: "Cheiron gave him a stout ashen shaft which he had cut for a spear, and Athena, it is said, polished it, and Hephaestus fitted it with a head."[^cyp-spear] Apollodorus confirms: "Chiron gave Peleus an ashen spear."[^apd-spear]

In the Iliad, the spear becomes [Achilles](../heroes/achilles.md)' signature weapon: "that spear could none other of the Achaians wield, but Achilles alone awaited to wield it, the Pelian ashen spear that Cheiron gave to his father dear, from a peak of Pelion, to be the death of warriors."[^il19-spear]

[^cyp-spear]: "Cheiron gave him a stout ashen shaft which he had cut for a spear, and Athena, it is said, polished it, and Hephaestus fitted it with a head" (Cypria, Fragment 5, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^apd-spear]: "Chiron gave Peleus an ashen spear" (Bibliotheca 3.13.5, trans. Frazer)
[^il19-spear]: "that spear could none other of the Achaians wield, but Achilles alone awaited to wield it, the Pelian ashen spear that Cheiron gave to his father dear, from a peak of Pelion, to be the death of warriors" (Iliad XIX.11252-11255, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

## Advisor to Peleus

Chiron advised Peleus on how to win [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md) as his bride. "Chiron, therefore, having advised Peleus to seize her and hold her fast in spite of her shape-shifting, he watched his chance and carried her off, and though she turned, now into fire, now into water, and now into a beast, he did not let her go till he saw that she had resumed her former shape."[^apd-thetis-advice]

When Peleus was later abandoned by Acastus on Mount Pelion, "he had not been saved by Chiron, who also restored him his sword."[^apd-peleus-rescue]

[^apd-thetis-advice]: "Chiron, therefore, having advised Peleus to seize her and hold her fast in spite of her shape-shifting, he watched his chance and carried her off, and though she turned, now into fire, now into water, and now into a beast, he did not let her go till he saw that she had resumed her former shape" (Bibliotheca 3.13.5, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-peleus-rescue]: "Peleus was caught by the centaurs and would have perished, if he had not been saved by Chiron, who also restored him his sword, which he had sought and found" (Bibliotheca 3.13.3, trans. Frazer)

## Death

Chiron's death came about through misfortune during [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md)' battle with the centaurs. When the centaurs "took refuge with Chiron, who, driven by the Lapiths from Mount Pelion, took up his abode at Malea," Heracles "shot an arrow at them, which, passing through the arm of Elatus, stuck in the knee of Chiron."[^apd-wound] Heracles tried to help: "Hercules ran up to him, drew out the shaft, and applied a medicine which Chiron gave him. But the hurt proving incurable, Chiron retired to the cave and there he wished to die, but he could not, for he was immortal."[^apd-death]

The resolution came through an exchange: "Prometheus offered himself to Zeus to be immortal in his stead, and so Chiron died."[^apd-prometheus] This is confirmed again later: Heracles "presented Chiron, who, though immortal, consented to die in his stead."[^apd-death2]

[^apd-wound]: "Thence they took refuge with Chiron, who, driven by the Lapiths from Mount Pelion, took up his abode at Malea. As the centaurs cowered about Chiron, Hercules shot an arrow at them, which, passing through the arm of Elatus, stuck in the knee of Chiron" (Bibliotheca 2.5.4, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-death]: "Hercules ran up to him, drew out the shaft, and applied a medicine which Chiron gave him. But the hurt proving incurable, Chiron retired to the cave and there he wished to die, but he could not, for he was immortal" (Bibliotheca 2.5.4, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-prometheus]: "Prometheus offered himself to Zeus to be immortal in his stead, and so Chiron died" (Bibliotheca 2.5.4, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-death2]: "to Zeus he presented Chiron, who, though immortal, consented to die in his stead" (Bibliotheca 2.5.11, trans. Frazer)

## In the Fabulae

The [Fabulae](../sources/hyginus.md) provides details about Chiron's birth and the aftermath for his mother Philyra.

### The Horse-Form Birth

"When Saturn was hunting Jove throughout the earth, assuming the form of a steed he lay with Philyra, daughter of Ocean."[^hyg-138-conception] This confirms the horse-form tradition but adds specific context — [Cronos](../deities/cronos.md) (Saturn) was pursuing [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) (Jove) at the time.

"By him she bore Chiron the Centaur, who is said to have been the first to invent the art of healing."[^hyg-138-birth] The Fabulae credits Chiron with inventing medicine itself, making him not just a teacher but the originator of the medical art.

### Philyra's Transformation

A unique detail: "After Philyra saw that she had borne a strange species, she asked Jove to change her into another form, and she was transformed into the tree which is called the linden."[^hyg-138-linden] This explains the mother's fate — horrified by giving birth to a centaur, she begged to become a tree.

> **NEW DETAIL:** Philyra's transformation into a linden tree is found only in the Fabulae among these sources. The transformation is explicitly caused by her distress at bearing a "strange species."

## In [Pindar](../sources/pindar.md)

### A Soul Loving Unto Men (Pythian III)

Pindar opens Pythian III with a wish that Chiron were still alive: "Fain were I (if meet it be to utter from my mouth the prayer conceived of all) that Cheiron the son of Philyra were alive and had not perished among men." He describes Chiron as "that Beast untamed, whose soul was loving unto men" and as "the Kentaur of Magnes." Here he is cast specifically in his role as Asclepius's teacher: training "the gentle deviser of limb-saving anodynes, Asklepios, the hero that was a defence against all kind of bodily plague."[^pin-py3-chiron]

[^pin-py3-chiron]: "Fain were I... that Cheiron the son of Philyra were alive and had not perished among men, even the wide-ruling seed of Kronos the son of Ouranos; and that there still lorded it in Pelion's glens that Beast untamed, whose soul was loving unto men, even such as when of old he trained the gentle deviser of limb-saving anodynes, Asklepios, the hero that was a defence against all kind of bodily plague" (Pindar, Pythian III, trans. Ernest Myers)

### Teaching Three Heroes (Nemean III)

In Nemean III, Pindar gives a striking sequential account of Chiron's three greatest pupils: "within his cavern of stone did deep-counselled Cheiron rear Jason, and next Asklepios, whom he taught to apportion healing drugs with gentle hand." After these, "he saw the espousals of Nereus' daughter of the shining wrists, and fondling nursed her son, strongest of men, rearing his soul in a life of harmony; until by blowing of sea winds wafted to Troy he should await the war-cry of the Lykians and of the Phrygians."[^pin-nem3-chiron]

[^pin-nem3-chiron]: "within his cavern of stone did deep-counselled Cheiron rear Jason, and next Asklepios, whom he taught to apportion healing drugs with gentle hand: after this it was that he saw the espousals of Nereus' daughter of the shining wrists, and fondling nursed her son, strongest of men, rearing his soul in a life of harmony" (Pindar, Nemean III, trans. Ernest Myers)

### Advising Apollo About Kyrene (Pythian IX)

When [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) encountered the huntress Kyrene and asked Chiron whether he should pursue her openly or in secret, "the Centaur bold with a frank smile on his mild brow made answer straightway of his wisdom." He gently chided the god for asking what he already knew: "Secret are wise Lovecraft's keys unto love's sanctities, O Phoibos... thou who mayest have no part in lies, thy soft desire hath led to dissemble in this thy speech." He then prophesied Kyrene's destiny — her marriage to Apollo, her son Aristaios, and her kingdom in Libya.[^pin-py9-chiron]

[^pin-py9-chiron]: "the Centaur bold with a frank smile on his mild brow made answer straightway of his wisdom: 'Secret are wise Lovecraft's keys unto love's sanctities, O Phoibos, and among gods and men alike all deem this shame, to have pleasure of marriage at the first openly'" (Pindar, Pythian IX, trans. Ernest Myers)
