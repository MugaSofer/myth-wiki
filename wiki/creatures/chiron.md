## Overview

**Chiron** is a centaur of unique origin and character, born of [Cronos](../deities/cronos.md) and the Oceanid Philyra. Unlike other centaurs, he is consistently described as wise, righteous, and skilled in medicine and hunting. He served as teacher and foster-father to several of the greatest heroes, including Achilles, Asclepius, Jason, and Actaeon.

## Parentage and Origin

Chiron's origin is distinctive among the centaurs: he was born from the union of [Cronos](../deities/cronos.md) and Philyra, "daughter of Ocean." The [Epic Cycle](../sources/epic-cycle.md) (War of the Titans) explains that "Cronos took the shape of a horse and lay with Philyra, the daughter of Ocean. Through this cause Cheiron was born a centaur: his wife was Chariclo."[^titan-origin] Apollodorus confirms: "to Cronus and Philyra was born Chiron, a centaur of double form."[^apd-parentage]

The Hesiodic Catalogue of Women also identifies him as "Cheiron the son of Philyra."[^cat-philyra]

[^titan-origin]: "Cronos took the shape of a horse and lay with Philyra, the daughter of Ocean. Through this cause Cheiron was born a centaur: his wife was Chariclo" (War of the Titans, Fragment 6, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^apd-parentage]: "to Cronus and Philyra was born Chiron, a centaur of double form" (Bibliotheca 1.2.4, trans. Frazer)
[^cat-philyra]: "Cheiron the son of Philyra brought up in the mountains" (Catalogue of Women, Fragment, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Character

In the Iliad, Chiron is called "the most righteous of the Centaurs" — Eurypylos asks Patroklos for healing herbs "whereof they say that thou hast learned from Achilles, whom Cheiron taught, the most righteous of the Centaurs."[^il11-righteous]

[^il11-righteous]: "these good herbs whereof they say that thou hast learned from Achilles, whom Cheiron taught, the most righteous of the Centaurs" (Iliad XI.6941-6943, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

## As Teacher

### Achilles

Chiron's most prominent role across the sources is as the teacher and foster-father of [Achilles](../heroes/achilles.md). In the Iliad, Chiron taught medicine that passed through a chain from himself to Achilles to Patroklos: Machaon treats Menelaos with "soothing drugs, such as Cheiron of his good will had imparted to his sire."[^il4-medicine] In Book XI, Eurypylos asks Patroklos for these same healing arts, learned "from Achilles, whom Cheiron taught."[^il11-righteous]

Apollodorus gives the fullest account. After [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md) abandoned infant Achilles, "Peleus brought the child to Chiron, who received him and fed him on the inwards of lions and wild swine and the marrows of bears, and named him Achilles, because he had not put his lips to the breast; but before that time his name was Ligyron."[^apd-achilles-rearing]

The Hesiodic Catalogue confirms: "Chiron was tending the son of Peleus, swift-footed Achilles, pre-eminent among men, on woody Pelion; for he was still a boy."[^cat-achilles]

[^il4-medicine]: "cunningly spread thereon soothing drugs, such as Cheiron of his good will had imparted to his sire" (Iliad IV.2272-2274, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^apd-achilles-rearing]: "Peleus brought the child to Chiron, who received him and fed him on the inwards of lions and wild swine and the marrows of bears, and named him Achilles, because he had not put his lips to the breast; but before that time his name was Ligyron" (Bibliotheca 3.13.6, trans. Frazer)
[^cat-achilles]: "But Chiron was tending the son of Peleus, swift-footed Achilles, pre-eminent among men, on woody Pelion; for he was still a boy" (Catalogue of Women, ll. 100-106, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

### Asclepius

Apollo "snatched the babe from the pyre and brought it to Chiron, the centaur, by whom he was brought up and taught the arts of healing and hunting."[^apd-asclepius] This makes Chiron the original source of human medicine in the Greek tradition — both the Iliad's chain of medical knowledge (Chiron to Achilles to Patroklos) and Asclepius's divine surgical skill derive from him.

[^apd-asclepius]: "he snatched the babe from the pyre and brought it to Chiron, the centaur, by whom he was brought up and taught the arts of healing and hunting" (Bibliotheca 3.10.3, trans. Frazer)

### Jason

The Hesiodic tradition records that Jason was also Chiron's pupil: "Aeson, who begot a son Iason, shepherd of the people, whom Chiron brought up in woody Pelion."[^cat-jason]

[^cat-jason]: "Aeson, who begot a son Iason, shepherd of the people, whom Chiron brought up in woody Pelion" (Catalogue of Women, Fragment, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

### Actaeon

"Autonoe and Aristaeus had a son Actaeon, who was bred by Chiron to be a hunter."[^apd-actaeon] After Actaeon was devoured by his own dogs, they "sought their master howling lamentably, and in the search they came to the cave of Chiron, who fashioned an image of Actaeon, which soothed their grief."[^apd-actaeon-image]

[^apd-actaeon]: "Autonoe and Aristaeus had a son Actaeon, who was bred by Chiron to be a hunter" (Bibliotheca 3.4.4, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-actaeon-image]: "in the search they came to the cave of Chiron, who fashioned an image of Actaeon, which soothed their grief" (Bibliotheca 3.4.4, trans. Frazer)

### Phoenix

Peleus "brought him to Chiron, who restored his sight, and thereupon Peleus made him king of the Dolopians."[^apd-phoenix]

[^apd-phoenix]: "Peleus brought him to Chiron, who restored his sight, and thereupon Peleus made him king of the Dolopians" (Bibliotheca 3.13.8, trans. Frazer)

### Medeus

Chiron raised Medeus, son of Jason and Medea: "bare a son Medeus whom Cheiron the son of Philyra brought up in the mountains."[^cat-medeus]

[^cat-medeus]: "bare a son Medeus whom Cheiron the son of Philyra brought up in the mountains" (Catalogue of Women, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## The Pelian Spear

Chiron gave Peleus the famous ash-wood spear at his wedding to [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md). The [Epic Cycle](../sources/epic-cycle.md) (Cypria) records: "Cheiron gave him a stout ashen shaft which he had cut for a spear, and Athena, it is said, polished it, and Hephaestus fitted it with a head."[^cyp-spear] Apollodorus confirms: "Chiron gave Peleus an ashen spear."[^apd-spear]

In the Iliad, the spear becomes [Achilles](../heroes/achilles.md)' signature weapon: "that spear could none other of the Achaians wield, but Achilles alone awaited to wield it, the Pelian ashen spear that Cheiron gave to his father dear, from a peak of Pelion, to be the death of warriors."[^il19-spear]

[^cyp-spear]: "Cheiron gave him a stout ashen shaft which he had cut for a spear, and Athena, it is said, polished it, and Hephaestus fitted it with a head" (Cypria, Fragment 5, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^apd-spear]: "Chiron gave Peleus an ashen spear" (Bibliotheca 3.13.5, trans. Frazer)
[^il19-spear]: "that spear could none other of the Achaians wield, but Achilles alone awaited to wield it, the Pelian ashen spear that Cheiron gave to his father dear, from a peak of Pelion, to be the death of warriors" (Iliad XIX.11252-11255, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

## Advisor to Peleus

Chiron advised Peleus on how to win [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md) as his bride. "Chiron, therefore, having advised Peleus to seize her and hold her fast in spite of her shape-shifting, he watched his chance and carried her off, and though she turned, now into fire, now into water, and now into a beast, he did not let her go till he saw that she had resumed her former shape."[^apd-thetis-advice]

When Peleus was later abandoned by Acastus on Mount Pelion, "he had not been saved by Chiron, who also restored him his sword."[^apd-peleus-rescue]

[^apd-thetis-advice]: "Chiron, therefore, having advised Peleus to seize her and hold her fast in spite of her shape-shifting, he watched his chance and carried her off, and though she turned, now into fire, now into water, and now into a beast, he did not let her go till he saw that she had resumed her former shape" (Bibliotheca 3.13.5, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-peleus-rescue]: "Peleus was caught by the centaurs and would have perished, if he had not been saved by Chiron, who also restored him his sword, which he had sought and found" (Bibliotheca 3.13.3, trans. Frazer)

## Death

Chiron's death came about through misfortune during [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md)' battle with the centaurs. When the centaurs "took refuge with Chiron, who, driven by the Lapiths from Mount Pelion, took up his abode at Malea," Heracles "shot an arrow at them, which, passing through the arm of Elatus, stuck in the knee of Chiron."[^apd-wound] Heracles tried to help: "Hercules ran up to him, drew out the shaft, and applied a medicine which Chiron gave him. But the hurt proving incurable, Chiron retired to the cave and there he wished to die, but he could not, for he was immortal."[^apd-death]

The resolution came through an exchange: "Prometheus offered himself to Zeus to be immortal in his stead, and so Chiron died."[^apd-prometheus] This is confirmed again later: Heracles "presented Chiron, who, though immortal, consented to die in his stead."[^apd-death2]

[^apd-wound]: "Thence they took refuge with Chiron, who, driven by the Lapiths from Mount Pelion, took up his abode at Malea. As the centaurs cowered about Chiron, Hercules shot an arrow at them, which, passing through the arm of Elatus, stuck in the knee of Chiron" (Bibliotheca 2.5.4, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-death]: "Hercules ran up to him, drew out the shaft, and applied a medicine which Chiron gave him. But the hurt proving incurable, Chiron retired to the cave and there he wished to die, but he could not, for he was immortal" (Bibliotheca 2.5.4, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-prometheus]: "Prometheus offered himself to Zeus to be immortal in his stead, and so Chiron died" (Bibliotheca 2.5.4, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-death2]: "to Zeus he presented Chiron, who, though immortal, consented to die in his stead" (Bibliotheca 2.5.11, trans. Frazer)
