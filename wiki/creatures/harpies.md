### Podarge and Achilles' Horses (Book XVI)

A harpy named Podarge is named as the mother of Achilles' immortal horses Xanthos and Balios: "the swift horses, Xanthos and Balios, that fly as swift as the winds, the horses that the harpy Podarge bare to the West Wind, as she grazed on the meadow by the stream of Okeanos."[^il16-podarge] These horses are later called "swift-footed immortal horses... that the gods gave to Peleus, a splendid gift."[^il16-gift]

This is a third harpy not named in the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md), which lists only Aello and Ocypetes.

[^il16-podarge]: "the swift horses, Xanthos and Balios, that fly as swift as the winds, the horses that the harpy Podarge bare to the West Wind, as she grazed on the meadow by the stream of Okeanos" (Iliad XVI.9546-9548, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il16-gift]: "his swift-footed immortal horses bare him out of the battle, horses that the gods gave to Peleus, a splendid gift" (Iliad XVI.10008-10009)
