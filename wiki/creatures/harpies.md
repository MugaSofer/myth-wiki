[^theog-desc]: "she bare him swift Iris and the long-haired Harpies, Aello (Storm-swift) and Ocypetes (Swift-flier) who on their swift wings keep pace with the blasts of the winds and the birds; for quick as time they dart along." (Theogony 267-269, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## In the Iliad

### Podarge and Achilles' Horses (Book XVI)

A harpy named Podarge is named as the mother of Achilles' immortal horses Xanthos and Balios: "the swift horses, Xanthos and Balios, that fly as swift as the winds, the horses that the harpy Podarge bare to the West Wind, as she grazed on the meadow by the stream of Okeanos."[^il16-podarge] These horses are later called "swift-footed immortal horses... that the gods gave to Peleus, a splendid gift."[^il16-gift]

This is a third harpy not named in the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md), which lists only Aello and Ocypetes.

[^il16-podarge]: "the swift horses, Xanthos and Balios, that fly as swift as the winds, the horses that the harpy Podarge bare to the West Wind, as she grazed on the meadow by the stream of Okeanos" (Iliad XVI.9546-9548, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il16-gift]: "his swift-footed immortal horses bare him out of the battle, horses that the gods gave to Peleus, a splendid gift" (Iliad XVI.10008-10009)

## Appearances

- **[Theogony](../sources/theogony.md)** 265-269: Birth and description
- **[Iliad](../sources/iliad.md)** XVI: Podarge (a third harpy) bore Xanthos and Balios to the West Wind by the stream of Okeanos; "swift-footed immortal horses... that the gods gave to Peleus"
- **[Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md)** 1.2.6: "to Thaumas and Electra were born Iris and the Harpies, Aello and Ocypete" — confirms the Theogony's account, naming Ocypete (vs. Theogony's "Ocypetes")
- **[Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md)** 1.9.21: Tormented the blind seer Phineus — "winged female creatures, and when a table was laid for Phineus, they flew down from the sky and snatched up most of the victuals, and what little they left stank so that nobody could touch it." Zetes and Calais, sons of Boreas, pursued them through the air. One fell into the river Tigres (called Nicothoe or Aellopus); the other, Ocypete (or Ocythoe; Hesiod calls her Ocypode), fled to the Echinadian Islands (now called Strophades). Apollonius says they suffered no harm, having sworn an oath not to wrong Phineus again.[^apd-phineus]

[^apd-phineus]: "The gods also sent the Harpies to him. These were winged female creatures, and when a table was laid for Phineus, they flew down from the sky and snatched up most of the victuals, and what little they left stank so that nobody could touch it. When the Argonauts would have consulted him about the voyage, he said that he would advise them about it if they would rid him of the Harpies... Zetes and Calais, the sons of Boreas, saw that, they drew their swords and, being winged, pursued them through the air" (Bibliotheca 1.9.21, trans. Frazer)
