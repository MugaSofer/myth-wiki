### Torment of Phineus

At the land of Phineus, the blind seer had been tormented by the Harpies for refusing to obey [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md)'s commands. "Swooping through the clouds, the Harpies with their crooked beaks incessantly snatched the food away from his mouth and hands." They also poured forth "a loathsome stench" so that even what little food they left could not be eaten.[^arg-harp-phineus]

Zetes and Calais, the winged sons of Boreas among the Argonauts, chased the Harpies through the air. Iris appeared and stopped them from killing the Harpies, swearing an oath that they would not trouble Phineus again. The Harpies then retreated to "their den in Minoan Crete."[^arg-harp-iris]

[^arg-harp-phineus]: "swooping through the clouds, the Harpies with their crooked beaks incessantly snatched the food away from his mouth and hands... and they poured forth over all a loathsome stench" (Argonautica 2.188-193, trans. R.C. Seaton)
[^arg-harp-iris]: Iris stopped Zetes and Calais from killing the Harpies, swearing an oath; the Harpies retreated to "their den in Minoan Crete" (Argonautica 2.285-300, trans. R.C. Seaton)

## In the Iliad

### Podarge and Achilles' Horses (Book XVI)

A harpy named Podarge is named as the mother of Achilles' immortal horses Xanthos and Balios: "the swift horses, Xanthos and Balios, that fly as swift as the winds, the horses that the harpy Podarge bare to the West Wind, as she grazed on the meadow by the stream of Okeanos."[^il16-podarge] These horses are later called "swift-footed immortal horses... that the gods gave to Peleus, a splendid gift."[^il16-gift]

This is a third harpy not named in the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md), which lists only Aello and Ocypetes.

[^il16-podarge]: "the swift horses, Xanthos and Balios, that fly as swift as the winds, the horses that the harpy Podarge bare to the West Wind, as she grazed on the meadow by the stream of Okeanos" (Iliad 16.176-179, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il16-gift]: "his swift-footed immortal horses bare him out of the battle, horses that the gods gave to Peleus, a splendid gift" (Iliad 16.858-860)

## In the [Aeneid](../sources/aeneid.md)

### The Strophades (3.209-269)

In the [Aeneid](../sources/aeneid.md), [Aeneas](../heroes/aeneas.md) and his fleet land at the Strophades, where they find herds of cattle and goats. Virgil describes the Harpies vividly: "winged things with maidens' countenance, bellies dropping filth, and clawed hands and faces ever wan with hunger."[^aen-harp-desc] They "than these no deadlier portent nor any fiercer plague of divine wrath hath issued from the Stygian waters."[^aen-harp-plague]

When the Trojans feast, the Harpies swoop down "from the mountains, and shaking their wings with loud clangour, plunder the feast, and defile everything with unclean touch, spreading a foul smell, and uttering dreadful cries."[^aen-harp-attack] The Trojans attempt to fight them, but swords cannot wound them: "they take no violence on their plumage, nor wounds on their bodies."[^aen-harp-invulnerable]

Their leader **Celaeno** then prophesies: "Italy is your goal; wooing the winds you shall go to Italy, and enter her harbours unhindered. Yet shall you not wall round your ordained city, ere this murderous outrage on us compel you, in portentous hunger, to eat your tables with gnawing teeth."[^aen-harp-prophecy] She claims this prophecy from a chain of divine authority: "the Lord omnipotent foretold to Phoebus, Phoebus Apollo to me, I eldest born of the Furies." This is a third named Harpy not found in the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md), which lists only Aello and Ocypetes.

[^aen-harp-desc]: "winged things with maidens' countenance, bellies dropping filth, and clawed hands and faces ever wan with hunger" (Aeneid 3.216-218, trans. J.W. Mackail)
[^aen-harp-plague]: "Than these no deadlier portent nor any fiercer plague of divine wrath hath issued from the Stygian waters" (Aeneid 3.214-215)
[^aen-harp-attack]: "the Harpies are upon us, swooping awfully from the mountains, and shaking their wings with loud clangour, plunder the feast, and defile everything with unclean touch, spreading a foul smell, and uttering dreadful cries" (Aeneid 3.225-228)
[^aen-harp-invulnerable]: "they take no violence on their plumage, nor wounds on their bodies; and soaring into the firmament with rapid flight, leave their foul traces on the spoil they had half consumed" (Aeneid 3.242-244)
[^aen-harp-prophecy]: "Italy is your goal; wooing the winds you shall go to Italy, and enter her harbours unhindered. Yet shall you not wall round your ordained city, ere this murderous outrage on us compel you, in portentous hunger, to eat your tables with gnawing teeth" (Aeneid 3.253-257)

- **[Theogony](../sources/theogony.md)** 265-269: Birth and description
- **[Iliad](../sources/iliad.md)** XVI: Podarge (a third harpy) bore Xanthos and Balios to the West Wind by the stream of Okeanos; "swift-footed immortal horses... that the gods gave to Peleus"
- **[Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md)** 1.2.6: "to Thaumas and Electra were born Iris and the Harpies, Aello and Ocypete" — confirms the Theogony's account, naming Ocypete (vs. Theogony's "Ocypetes")
- **[Aeneid](../sources/aeneid.md)** III: At the Strophades; "winged things with maidens' countenance, bellies dropping filth, and clawed hands"; invulnerable to swords; defile the Trojans' feast; Celaeno ("eldest born of the Furies") prophesies they will eat their tables before founding their city
- **[Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md)** 1.9.21: Tormented the blind seer Phineus — "winged female creatures, and when a table was laid for Phineus, they flew down from the sky and snatched up most of the victuals, and what little they left stank so that nobody could touch it." Zetes and Calais, sons of Boreas, pursued them through the air. One fell into the river Tigres (called Nicothoe or Aellopus); the other, Ocypete (or Ocythoe; Hesiod calls her Ocypode), fled to the Echinadian Islands (now called Strophades). Apollonius says they suffered no harm, having sworn an oath not to wrong Phineus again.[^apd-phineus]

[^apd-phineus]: "The gods also sent the Harpies to him. These were winged female creatures, and when a table was laid for Phineus, they flew down from the sky and snatched up most of the victuals, and what little they left stank so that nobody could touch it. When the Argonauts would have consulted him about the voyage, he said that he would advise them about it if they would rid him of the Harpies... Zetes and Calais, the sons of Boreas, saw that, they drew their swords and, being winged, pursued them through the air" (Bibliotheca 1.9.21, trans. Frazer)
