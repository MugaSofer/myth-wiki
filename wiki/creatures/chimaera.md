## Overview

The **Chimaera** was a fire-breathing monster with three heads, daughter of [Echidna](echidna.md) and [Typhoeus](typhoeus.md).

## Description

"Chimaera who breathed raging fire, a creature fearful, great, swift-footed and strong, who had three heads, one of a grim-eyed lion; in her hinderpart, a dragon; and in her middle, a goat, breathing forth a fearful blast of blazing fire."[^theog-desc]

[^theog-desc]: "Chimaera who breathed raging fire, a creature fearful, great, swift-footed and strong, who had three heads, one of a grim-eyed lion; in her hinderpart, a dragon; and in her middle, a goat, breathing forth a fearful blast of blazing fire" (Theogony 319-324, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Mythology

"Her did [Pegasus](pegasus.md) and noble [Bellerophon](../heroes/bellerophon.md) slay."[^theog-slay]

[^theog-slay]: "Her did Pegasus and noble Bellerophon slay" (Theogony 325)

## In the Iliad

### The Bellerophon Story (Book VI)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book VI, Glaukos tells Diomedes the story of his ancestor [Bellerophon](../heroes/bellerophon.md). The Chimaera is described with a slightly different formulation from the Theogony: "Of divine birth was she and not of men, in front a lion, and behind a serpent, and in the midst a goat; and she breathed dread fierceness of blazing fire."[^il6-chimaira]

Here she is called "Chimaira the unconquerable" and her divine origin is emphasized — "of divine birth was she and not of men" — a detail not found in the Theogony. [Bellerophon](../heroes/bellerophon.md) "slew [her], obedient to the signs of heaven."[^il6-slain]

### Variant Details

The [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md) describes three *heads* (lion, dragon, goat) and names [Echidna](echidna.md) and [Typhoeus](typhoeus.md) as parents. The Iliad describes three *parts* (front, middle, behind) without naming specific parents, instead saying she was "of divine birth." The Theogony credits [Pegasus](pegasus.md) and [Bellerophon](../heroes/bellerophon.md) jointly; the Iliad credits [Bellerophon](../heroes/bellerophon.md) alone.

[^il6-chimaira]: "he bade him slay Chimaira the unconquerable. Of divine birth was she and not of men, in front a lion, and behind a serpent, and in the midst a goat; and she breathed dread fierceness of blazing fire" (Iliad VI.3621-3624, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il6-slain]: "And her he slew, obedient to the signs of heaven" (Iliad VI.3624)

## In the Bibliotheca (2.3.1)

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) provides yet another arrangement of the Chimaera's anatomy: "it had the fore part of a lion, the tail of a dragon, and its third head, the middle one, was that of a goat, through which it belched fire."[^apd-chim-desc] It emphasizes the creature's power: "it was more than a match for many, let alone one" and "it was a single creature with the power of three beasts."[^apd-chim-power]

The Bibliotheca adds that the Chimaera "devastated the country and harried the cattle" and specifies that it "was bred by Amisodarus, as Homer also affirms."[^apd-chim-amisodarus] Its parentage is confirmed: "it was begotten by Typhon on [Echidna](echidna.md), as Hesiod relates."[^apd-chim-parents]

Bellerophon "mounted his winged steed [Pegasus](pegasus.md), offspring of Medusa and [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md), and soaring on high shot down the Chimera from the height."[^apd-chim-slay]

> **VARIANT COMPARISON:** The [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md) gives three *heads* (lion, dragon, goat). The [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) gives three *body parts* (front lion, middle goat, behind serpent). The Bibliotheca gives a composite: fore part of a lion, tail of a dragon, and a middle *head* that is a goat through which it breathes fire. Only the Bibliotheca mentions Amisodarus as breeder.

[^apd-chim-desc]: "it had the fore part of a lion, the tail of a dragon, and its third head, the middle one, was that of a goat, through which it belched fire" (Bibliotheca 2.3.1, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-chim-power]: "it was more than a match for many, let alone one; it had the fore part of a lion, the tail of a dragon... it was a single creature with the power of three beasts." (Bibliotheca 2.3.1)
[^apd-chim-amisodarus]: "it was bred by Amisodarus, as Homer also affirms" (Bibliotheca 2.3.1)
[^apd-chim-parents]: "it was begotten by Typhon on Echidna, as Hesiod relates" (Bibliotheca 2.3.1)
[^apd-chim-slay]: "Bellerophon mounted his winged steed Pegasus, offspring of Medusa and Poseidon, and soaring on high shot down the Chimera from the height." (Bibliotheca 2.3.2, trans. J.G. Frazer)
