## Overview

The **Chimaera** was a fire-breathing monster with three heads, daughter of [Echidna](echidna.md) and [Typhoeus](typhoeus.md).

## Description

"Chimaera who breathed raging fire, a creature fearful, great, swift-footed and strong, who had three heads, one of a grim-eyed lion; in her hinderpart, a dragon; and in her middle, a goat, breathing forth a fearful blast of blazing fire."[^theog-desc]

[^theog-desc]: "Chimaera who breathed raging fire, a creature fearful, great, swift-footed and strong, who had three heads, one of a grim-eyed lion; in her hinderpart, a dragon; and in her middle, a goat, breathing forth a fearful blast of blazing fire" (Theogony 319-324, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Mythology

"Her did [Pegasus](pegasus.md) and noble [Bellerophon](../heroes/bellerophon.md) slay."[^theog-slay]

[^theog-slay]: "Her did Pegasus and noble Bellerophon slay" (Theogony 325)

## In the Iliad

### The Bellerophon Story (Book VI)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book VI, Glaukos tells Diomedes the story of his ancestor [Bellerophon](../heroes/bellerophon.md). The Chimaera is described with a slightly different formulation from the Theogony: "Of divine birth was she and not of men, in front a lion, and behind a serpent, and in the midst a goat; and she breathed dread fierceness of blazing fire."[^il6-chimaira]

Here she is called "Chimaira the unconquerable" and her divine origin is emphasized — "of divine birth was she and not of men" — a detail not found in the Theogony. [Bellerophon](../heroes/bellerophon.md) "slew [her], obedient to the signs of heaven."[^il6-slain]

### Variant Details

The [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md) describes three *heads* (lion, dragon, goat) and names [Echidna](echidna.md) and [Typhoeus](typhoeus.md) as parents. The Iliad describes three *parts* (front, middle, behind) without naming specific parents, instead saying she was "of divine birth." The Theogony credits [Pegasus](pegasus.md) and [Bellerophon](../heroes/bellerophon.md) jointly; the Iliad credits [Bellerophon](../heroes/bellerophon.md) alone.

[^il6-chimaira]: "he bade him slay Chimaira the unconquerable. Of divine birth was she and not of men, in front a lion, and behind a serpent, and in the midst a goat; and she breathed dread fierceness of blazing fire" (Iliad VI.3621-3624, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il6-slain]: "And her he slew, obedient to the signs of heaven" (Iliad VI.3624)
