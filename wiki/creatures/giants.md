| **Parents** | [Gaia](../deities/gaia.md), from the blood of [Uranus](../deities/uranus.md) |
| **First appearance** | [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md) 185 |

## Overview

The **Giants** were born from the blood of [Uranus](../deities/uranus.md) that fell upon [Gaia](../deities/gaia.md) during his castration by [Cronos](../deities/cronos.md), alongside the [Erinyes](erinyes.md) and the Meliae nymphs.

## Description

They are described as "the great Giants with gleaming armour, holding long spears in their hands."[^theog-giants]

[^theog-giants]: "the great Giants with gleaming armour, holding long spears in their hands" (Theogony 185-186, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## In the Bibliotheca

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) provides the fullest surviving narrative of the **Gigantomachy** — the war between the gods and the Giants.

### Origin and Description

[Gaia](../deities/gaia.md) brought forth the Giants by [Uranus](../deities/uranus.md), provoked by the fate of the [Titans](../deities/titans.md). They were "matchless in the bulk of their bodies and invincible in their might; terrible of aspect did they appear, with long locks drooping from their head and chin, and with the scales of dragons for feet."[^apd-giants-desc] They were born "in Phlegrae, but according to others in Pallene," and "darted rocks and burning oaks at the sky."[^apd-giants-born]

> **VARIANT:** The [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md) says the Giants were born from the blood of [Uranus](../deities/uranus.md) falling on [Gaia](../deities/gaia.md) during his castration. The Bibliotheca says [Gaia](../deities/gaia.md) bore them by [Uranus](../deities/uranus.md), provoked by the Titans' imprisonment — a different mechanism entirely.

### The Oracle and Zeus's Stratagem

An oracle declared that no Giant could die at a god's hand alone — a mortal's help was needed. [Gaia](../deities/gaia.md) sought an herb to protect the Giants even from mortals. [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) "forbade the Dawn and the Moon and the Sun to shine, and then, before anybody else could get it, he culled the simple himself."[^apd-giants-herb] He then summoned [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) through [Athena](../deities/athena.md).

### Chief Giants

Porphyrion and Alcyoneus surpassed all the rest. Alcyoneus "was even immortal so long as he fought in the land of his birth" and "drove away the cows of the Sun from Erythia."[^apd-alcyoneus]

### The Battle

[Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) shot Alcyoneus with an arrow, but the Giant revived on touching his native ground. At [Athena](../deities/athena.md)'s advice, Heracles dragged him outside Pallene, and he died.[^apd-alcyoneus-death]

Porphyrion attacked both Heracles and [Hera](../deities/hera.md). [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) "inspired him with lust for Hera, and when he tore her robes and would have forced her, she called for help, and Zeus smote him with a thunderbolt, and Hercules shot him dead with an arrow."[^apd-porphyrion]

The remaining Giants were each slain by specific gods, always finished by [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md):

- **Ephialtes**: Shot by [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) in the left eye and by Heracles in the right[^apd-ephialtes]
- **Eurytus**: Killed by [Dionysus](../deities/dionysus.md) with a thyrsus[^apd-eurytus]
- **Clytius**: Killed by [Hecate](../deities/hecate.md) with torches[^apd-clytius]
- **Mimas**: Killed by [Hephaestus](../deities/hephaestus.md) with missiles of red-hot metal[^apd-mimas]
- **Enceladus**: Fled, and [Athena](../deities/athena.md) threw the island of Sicily upon him[^apd-enceladus]
- **Pallas**: Flayed by [Athena](../deities/athena.md), who used his skin as a shield[^apd-pallas]
- **Polybotes**: Chased by [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) through the sea; Poseidon broke off the island of Nisyrum and threw it on him[^apd-polybotes]
- **Hippolytus**: Slain by [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md) wearing the [helm of Hades](../objects/helm-of-hades.md)[^apd-hippolytus]
- **Gration**: Slain by [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md)[^apd-gration]
- **Agrius and Thoas**: Killed by the [Fates](../deities/fates.md) with brazen clubs[^apd-agrius-thoas]
