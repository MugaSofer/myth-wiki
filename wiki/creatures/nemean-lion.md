## Overview

The **Nemean Lion** was a monster raised by [Hera](../deities/hera.md) to plague the region of Nemea, eventually slain by [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md).

## Mythology

"[Hera](../deities/hera.md), the good wife of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md), brought up and made to haunt the hills of Nemea, a plague to men. There he preyed upon the tribes of her own people and had power over Tretus of Nemea and Apesas: yet the strength of stout [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) overcame him."[^theog-lion]

[^theog-lion]: "the Nemean lion, which Hera, the good wife of Zeus, brought up and made to haunt the hills of Nemea, a plague to men. There he preyed upon the tribes of her own people and had power over Tretus of Nemea and Apesas: yet the strength of stout Heracles overcame him." (Theogony 327-332, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## In the Bibliotheca (2.5.1)

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) describes the Nemean Lion as the first labour of [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) and provides a different parentage from the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md): it was "an invulnerable beast begotten by Typhon."[^apd-lion-origin]

When Heracles attacked, "he first shot an arrow at him, but when he perceived that the beast was invulnerable, he heaved up his club and made after him." The lion retreated into a cave with two mouths. Heracles blocked one entrance and entered through the other, "putting his arm round its neck held it tight till he had choked it."[^apd-lion-strangle] He then wore the lion's skin — a detail that becomes his signature appearance throughout the Bibliotheca.

> **VARIANT:** The [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md) gives the Nemean Lion's parents as [Echidna](echidna.md) and Orthus. The Bibliotheca instead names [Typhoeus](typhoeus.md) (Typhon) as parent and does not mention Echidna or Orthus. The Theogony also credits [Hera](../deities/hera.md) with raising the lion, which the Bibliotheca omits. The invulnerability is unique to the Bibliotheca.

[^apd-lion-origin]: "an invulnerable beast begotten by Typhon" (Bibliotheca 2.5.1, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-lion-strangle]: "putting his arm round its neck held it tight till he had choked it; so laying it on his shoulders he carried it to Cleonae." (Bibliotheca 2.5.1)

## Appearances

- **[Theogony](../sources/theogony.md)** 327-332: Parentage, terrorizing Nemea, defeat by Heracles
- **[Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md)** 2.5.1: "Invulnerable beast begotten by Typhon"; arrows useless; Heracles strangled it in its cave; wore its skin
