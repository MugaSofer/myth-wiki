The **Nemean Lion** was a monster raised by [Hera](../deities/hera.md) to plague the region of Nemea, eventually slain by [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md).

## Mythology

"[Hera](../deities/hera.md), the good wife of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md), brought up and made to haunt the hills of Nemea, a plague to men. There he preyed upon the tribes of her own people and had power over Tretus of Nemea and Apesas: yet the strength of stout [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) overcame him."[^theog-lion]
