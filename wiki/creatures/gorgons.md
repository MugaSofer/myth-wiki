## Mythology

### Medusa and Perseus

"The Dark-haired One" (Poseidon) lay with Medusa "in a soft meadow amid spring flowers."[^theog-poseidon] When [Perseus](../heroes/perseus.md) cut off her head, "there sprang forth great Chrysaor and the horse [Pegasus](pegasus.md) who is so called because he was born near the springs (*pegae*) of Ocean; and that other, because he held a golden blade (*aor*) in his hands."[^theog-perseus]

[Pegasus](pegasus.md) "flew away and left the earth... and came to the deathless gods: and he dwells in the house of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) and brings to wise Zeus the thunder and lightning."[^theog-pegasus]

Chrysaor, joined with Callirrhoe (daughter of [Oceanus](../deities/oceanus.md)), begot "three-headed Geryones," who was slain by [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) "in sea-girt Erythea."[^theog-geryones]

[^theog-poseidon]: "With her lay the Dark-haired One in a soft meadow amid spring flowers." (Theogony 278-279)
[^theog-perseus]: "And when Perseus cut off her head, there sprang forth great Chrysaor and the horse Pegasus who is so called because he was born near the springs of Ocean; and that other, because he held a golden blade in his hands." (Theogony 280-283)
[^theog-pegasus]: "Now Pegasus flew away and left the earth, the mother of flocks, and came to the deathless gods: and he dwells in the house of Zeus and brings to wise Zeus the thunder and lightning." (Theogony 284-286)
[^theog-geryones]: "But Chrysaor was joined in love to Callirrhoe, the daughter of glorious Ocean, and begot three-headed Geryones. Him mighty Heracles slew in sea-girt Erythea" (Theogony 287-294)
