## Overview

The **Gorgons** are three sisters, daughters of Ceto and Phorcys, who dwell "beyond glorious Ocean in the frontier land towards Night where are the clear-voiced Hesperides."[^theog-location]

[^theog-location]: "the Gorgons who dwell beyond glorious Ocean in the frontier land towards Night where are the clear-voiced Hesperides" (Theogony 274-276, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

- **Sthenno** — undying, does not age
- **Euryale** — undying, does not age

[^theog-mortal]: "Medusa who suffered a woeful fate: she was mortal, but the two were undying and grew not old." (Theogony 276-277)

## Mythology

### Medusa and Perseus

"The Dark-haired One" (Poseidon) lay with Medusa "in a soft meadow amid spring flowers."[^theog-poseidon] When [Perseus](../heroes/perseus.md) cut off her head, "there sprang forth great Chrysaor and the horse [Pegasus](pegasus.md) who is so called because he was born near the springs (*pegae*) of Ocean; and that other, because he held a golden blade (*aor*) in his hands."[^theog-perseus]

[Pegasus](pegasus.md) "flew away and left the earth... and came to the deathless gods: and he dwells in the house of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) and brings to wise Zeus the thunder and lightning."[^theog-pegasus]

Chrysaor, joined with Callirrhoe (daughter of [Oceanus](../deities/oceanus.md)), begot "three-headed Geryones," who was slain by [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) "in sea-girt Erythea."[^theog-geryones]

[^theog-poseidon]: "With her lay the Dark-haired One in a soft meadow amid spring flowers." (Theogony 278-279)
[^theog-perseus]: "And when Perseus cut off her head, there sprang forth great Chrysaor and the horse Pegasus who is so called because he was born near the springs of Ocean; and that other, because he held a golden blade in his hands." (Theogony 280-283)
[^theog-pegasus]: "Now Pegasus flew away and left the earth, the mother of flocks, and came to the deathless gods: and he dwells in the house of Zeus and brings to wise Zeus the thunder and lightning." (Theogony 284-286)
[^theog-geryones]: "But Chrysaor was joined in love to Callirrhoe, the daughter of glorious Ocean, and begot three-headed Geryones. Him mighty Heracles slew in sea-girt Erythea" (Theogony 287-294)

## In the Iliad

### On Agamemnon's Shield (Book XI)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book XI, Agamemnon's shield bears the Gorgon as a device: "thereon was embossed the Gorgon fell of aspect glaring terribly, and about her were Dread and Terror."[^il11-shield]

This is separate from the Gorgon head on [Athena](../deities/athena.md)'s aegis (described in [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book V) — here the Gorgon is a decorative emblem on a mortal's armour, paired with personified Dread and Terror.

[^il11-shield]: "thereon was embossed the Gorgon fell of aspect glaring terribly, and about her were Dread and Terror" (Iliad 11.38-39, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

## In the Bibliotheca (2.4.2)

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) provides by far the most detailed physical description of the Gorgons. [Perseus](../heroes/perseus.md), guided by [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md) and [Athena](../deities/athena.md), "flew to the ocean and caught the Gorgons asleep. They were Stheno, Euryale, and Medusa. Now Medusa alone was mortal; for that reason Perseus was sent to fetch her head."[^apd-gorgons-names]

Their appearance is described in vivid detail: "the Gorgons had heads twined about with the scales of dragons, and great tusks like swine's, and brazen hands, and golden wings, by which they flew; and they turned to stone such as beheld them."[^apd-gorgons-desc]

Perseus beheaded Medusa while [Athena](../deities/athena.md) guided his hand and he looked at a brazen shield to avoid her gaze. "When her head was cut off, there sprang from the Gorgon the winged horse [Pegasus](pegasus.md) and Chrysaor, the father of Geryon; these she had by [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md)."[^apd-gorgons-offspring] The surviving Gorgons "started up from their slumber and pursued Perseus: but they could not see him on account of the cap, for he was hidden by it."[^apd-gorgons-pursuit]

Perseus gave the Gorgon's head to [Athena](../deities/athena.md), who "inserted the Gorgon's head in the middle of her shield."[^apd-gorgons-shield]

[^apd-gorgons-names]: "flew to the ocean and caught the Gorgons asleep. They were Stheno, Euryale, and Medusa. Now Medusa alone was mortal; for that reason Perseus was sent to fetch her head." (Bibliotheca 2.4.2, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-gorgons-desc]: "the Gorgons had heads twined about with the scales of dragons, and great tusks like swine's, and brazen hands, and golden wings, by which they flew; and they turned to stone such as beheld them" (Bibliotheca 2.4.2, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-gorgons-offspring]: "When her head was cut off, there sprang from the Gorgon the winged horse Pegasus and Chrysaor, the father of Geryon; these she had by Poseidon." (Bibliotheca 2.4.2)
[^apd-gorgons-pursuit]: "the Gorgons started up from their slumber and pursued Perseus: but they could not see him on account of the cap, for he was hidden by it." (Bibliotheca 2.4.3)
[^apd-gorgons-shield]: "the Gorgon's head he gave to Athena... Athena inserted the Gorgon's head in the middle of her shield." (Bibliotheca 2.4.3)

## In Euripides' Ion

In [Euripides' Ion](../sources/euripides-ion.md), a different tradition about the Gorgon's origin and death is presented. During the Gigantomachy, the Earth itself gave birth to the Gorgon as a weapon against the gods: "There the earth brought forth the Gorgon, horrid monster... in succour of her sons to annoy the gods."[^eur-ion-gorgon-birth] [Athena](../deities/athena.md) slew her: "Her Pallas slew, daughter of Jove."[^eur-ion-gorgon-slain]

Athena wore the Gorgon's spoils as breastplate and shield: "Her breastplate arm'd with vipers wreathed around... Her spoils before her breast Minerva wore."[^eur-ion-gorgon-spoils]

Two drops of blood from the slain Gorgon were given by Athena to [Erichthonius](../heroes/erichthonius.md) with opposed properties: "The one works death, the other heals disease."[^eur-ion-gorgon-blood] This dual-natured gift is used as a plot device in the play — the deadly drop becomes a poison that kills a dove instantly when tested, before Creusa attempts to use it on Ion.
