## Overview

**Cerberus** is the monstrous hound that guards the entrance to the underworld, preventing the dead from leaving.

## Description

Cerberus is described as "a monster not to be overcome and that may not be described, Cerberus who eats raw flesh, the brazen-voiced hound of Hades, fifty-headed, relentless and strong."[^theog-desc]

In the description of [Tartarus](../places/tartarus.md), the hound (unnamed but matching) is described: "A fearful hound guards the house in front, pitiless, and he has a cruel trick. On those who go in he fawns with his tail and both his ears, but suffers them not to go out back again, but keeps watch and devours whomsoever he catches going out of the gates of strong [Hades](../deities/hades.md) and awful [Persephone](../deities/persephone.md)."[^theog-guard]
