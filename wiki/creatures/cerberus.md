## Overview

**Cerberus** is the monstrous hound that guards the entrance to the underworld, preventing the dead from leaving.

## Description

Cerberus is described as "a monster not to be overcome and that may not be described, Cerberus who eats raw flesh, the brazen-voiced hound of Hades, fifty-headed, relentless and strong."[^theog-desc]

In the description of [Tartarus](../places/tartarus.md), the hound (unnamed but matching) is described: "A fearful hound guards the house in front, pitiless, and he has a cruel trick. On those who go in he fawns with his tail and both his ears, but suffers them not to go out back again, but keeps watch and devours whomsoever he catches going out of the gates of strong [Hades](../deities/hades.md) and awful [Persephone](../deities/persephone.md)."[^theog-guard]

[^theog-desc]: "a monster not to be overcome and that may not be described, Cerberus who eats raw flesh, the brazen-voiced hound of Hades, fifty-headed, relentless and strong" (Theogony 310-312, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^theog-guard]: "A fearful hound guards the house in front, pitiless, and he has a cruel trick. On those who go in he fawns with his tail and both his ears, but suffers them not to go out back again, but keeps watch and devours whomsoever he catches going out of the gates of strong Hades and awful Persephone" (Theogony 769-774)

## In the Bibliotheca (2.5.12)

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) provides a strikingly different physical description from the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md). Where the Theogony gives Cerberus fifty heads, Apollodorus describes him with "three heads of dogs, the tail of a dragon, and on his back the heads of all sorts of snakes."[^apd-cerb-desc]

[Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md)' twelfth labour was to bring Cerberus from [Hades](../deities/hades.md). After being initiated at Eleusis and descending through Taenarum, Heracles asked [Hades](../deities/hades.md) for the creature. "Pluto ordered him to take the animal provided he mastered him without the use of the weapons which he carried."[^apd-cerb-terms] Heracles "found him at the gates of Acheron, and, cased in his cuirass and covered by the lion's skin, he flung his arms round the head of the brute, and though the dragon in its tail bit him, he never relaxed his grip and pressure till it yielded."[^apd-cerb-capture] He brought Cerberus up "through Troezen," showed him to Eurystheus, and then "carried him back to Hades."[^apd-cerb-return]

> **VARIANT:** The Theogony describes Cerberus as "fifty-headed"; the Bibliotheca gives him only three dog-heads but adds the dragon tail and snake-heads on his back. The three-headed version became the standard in later tradition.

[^apd-cerb-desc]: "this Cerberus had three heads of dogs, the tail of a dragon, and on his back the heads of all sorts of snakes" (Bibliotheca 2.5.12, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-cerb-terms]: "Pluto ordered him to take the animal provided he mastered him without the use of the weapons which he carried." (Bibliotheca 2.5.12)
[^apd-cerb-capture]: "Hercules found him at the gates of Acheron, and, cased in his cuirass and covered by the lion's skin, he flung his arms round the head of the brute, and though the dragon in its tail bit him, he never relaxed his grip and pressure till it yielded." (Bibliotheca 2.5.12, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-cerb-return]: "So he carried it off and ascended through Troezen." (Bibliotheca 2.5.12)
