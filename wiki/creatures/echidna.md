## Overview

**Echidna** is a monster described as half nymph, half serpent. She is the mother of many of the most famous monsters in Greek mythology.

## Description

She is "half a nymph with glancing eyes and fair cheeks, and half again a huge snake, great and awful, with speckled skin, eating raw flesh beneath the secret parts of the holy earth."[^theog-desc] She is "a nymph who dies not nor grows old all her days."[^theog-immortal]

[^theog-desc]: "half a nymph with glancing eyes and fair cheeks, and half again a huge snake, great and awful, with speckled skin, eating raw flesh beneath the secret parts of the holy earth." (Theogony 298-300)
[^theog-immortal]: "a nymph who dies not nor grows old all her days." (Theogony 305)

## Dwelling

"She has a cave deep down under a hollow rock far from the deathless gods and mortal men. There, then, did the gods appoint her a glorious house to dwell in: and she keeps guard in Arima beneath the earth."[^theog-home]

[^theog-home]: "And there she has a cave deep down under a hollow rock far from the deathless gods and mortal men. There, then, did the gods appoint her a glorious house to dwell in: and she keeps guard in Arima beneath the earth." (Theogony 301-304)

## Children

### With Typhaon

- **Orthus** — the hound of Geryones[^theog-orthus]
- **[Cerberus](cerberus.md)** — "a monster not to be overcome and that may not be described... the brazen-voiced hound of Hades, fifty-headed, relentless and strong"[^theog-cerberus]
- **The Hydra of Lerna** — "whom the goddess, white-armed [Hera](../deities/hera.md) nourished, being angry beyond measure with the mighty [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md)." Destroyed by Heracles "together with warlike Iolaus... through the plans of [Athena](../deities/athena.md) the spoil-driver."[^theog-hydra]
- **[Chimaera](chimaera.md)** — "who breathed raging fire, a creature fearful, great, swift-footed and strong, who had three heads, one of a grim-eyed lion; in her hinderpart, a dragon; and in her middle, a goat, breathing forth a fearful blast of blazing fire." Slain by Pegasus and Bellerophon.[^theog-chimaera]

### With Orthus

- **The [Sphinx](sphinx.md)** — "the deadly Sphinx which destroyed the Cadmeans"[^theog-sphinx]
- **The Nemean Lion** — "which [Hera](../deities/hera.md), the good wife of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md), brought up and made to haunt the hills of Nemea, a plague to men." Overcome by [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md).[^theog-lion]

[^theog-orthus]: "first she bare Orthus the hound of Geryones" (Theogony 309)
[^theog-cerberus]: "and then again she bare a second, a monster not to be overcome and that may not be described, Cerberus who eats raw flesh, the brazen-voiced hound of Hades, fifty-headed, relentless and strong." (Theogony 310-312)
[^theog-hydra]: "And again she bore a third, the evil-minded Hydra of Lerna, whom the goddess, white-armed Hera nourished, being angry beyond measure with the mighty Heracles. And her Heracles, the son of Zeus, of the house of Amphitryon, together with warlike Iolaus, destroyed with the unpitying sword through the plans of Athene the spoil-driver." (Theogony 313-318)
[^theog-chimaera]: "She was the mother of Chimaera who breathed raging fire, a creature fearful, great, swift-footed and strong, who had three heads, one of a grim-eyed lion; in her hinderpart, a dragon; and in her middle, a goat, breathing forth a fearful blast of blazing fire. Her did Pegasus and noble Bellerophon slay" (Theogony 319-325)
[^theog-sphinx]: "but Echidna was subject in love to Orthus and brought forth the deadly Sphinx which destroyed the Cadmeans" (Theogony 326-327)
[^theog-lion]: "and the Nemean lion, which Hera, the good wife of Zeus, brought up and made to haunt the hills of Nemea, a plague to men." ... "yet the strength of stout Heracles overcame him." (Theogony 327-332)

## In the Bibliotheca (2.1.2)

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) provides a distinct account of Echidna's parentage and death. She is called "daughter of Tartarus and Earth" — a parentage not given in the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md), which does not specify her parents. The text notes that she "used to carry off passers-by" and "was caught asleep and slain by Argus."[^apd-echidna-death]

> **VARIANT:** In the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md), Echidna is explicitly immortal — "a nymph who dies not nor grows old all her days." The Bibliotheca contradicts this by having her killed by Argus Panoptes. The Theogony also does not assign her specific parents, while the Bibliotheca names Tartarus and Earth (Gaia).

[^apd-echidna-death]: "Echidna, daughter of Tartarus and Earth, who used to carry off passers-by, was caught asleep and slain by Argus." (Bibliotheca 2.1.2, trans. J.G. Frazer)

## In the Fabulae

The [Fabulae](../sources/hyginus.md) gives an expanded list of Echidna's offspring.

### Children with Typhoeus (§151)

"From Typhon the giant and Echidna were born" an extensive brood:[^hyg-151-intro]

- **Gorgon** — listed as offspring here, though usually Gorgons are separate from Echidna's line
- **Cerberus** — "the three-headed dog"
- **The dragon which guarded the apples of the Hesperides across the ocean** — Ladon
- **The Hydra which Hercules killed by the spring of Lerna**
- **The dragon which guarded the ram's fleece at Colchis** — the Colchian dragon
- **Scylla** — "who was woman above but dog below, with six dog-forms sprung from her body"
- **The Sphinx which was in Boeotia**
- **The Chimaera in Lycia** — "which had the fore part of a lion, the hind part of a snake, while the she-goat itself formed the middle"

### Extended Progeny

The Fabulae continues the genealogy: "From Medusa, daughter of Gorgon, and Neptune, were born Chrysaor and horse Pegasus; from Chrysaor and Callirhoe, three-formed Geryon."[^hyg-151-extended]

> **VARIANT:** The Fabulae attributes many monsters to Echidna and Typhon that other sources give different parentages. Most notably, it makes Scylla and the Ladon (Hesperian dragon) their children, and it calls Gorgon their offspring while also making Medusa Gorgon's daughter — creating a nested relationship.

[^hyg-151-intro]: "From Typhon the giant and Echidna were born" (Fabulae §151, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-151-extended]: "From Medusa, daughter of Gorgon, and Neptune, were born Chrysaor and horse Pegasus; from Chrysaor and Callirhoe, three-formed Geryon" (Fabulae §151, trans. Mary Grant)
