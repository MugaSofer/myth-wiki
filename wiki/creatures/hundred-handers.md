## Overview

The **Hundred-Handers** are three monstrous beings, children of [Gaia](../deities/gaia.md) and [Uranus](../deities/uranus.md), described as "great and doughty beyond telling" and "the most terrible" of all Earth and Heaven's children.[^theog-terrible]

[^theog-terrible]: "And again, three other sons were born of Earth and Heaven, great and doughty beyond telling, Cottus and Briareos and Gyes, presumptuous children." ... "For of all the children that were born of Earth and Heaven, these were the most terrible, and they were hated by their own father from the first." (Theogony 147-155, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Description

"From their shoulders sprang an hundred arms, not to be approached, and each had fifty heads upon his shoulders on their strong limbs, and irresistible was the stubborn strength that was in their great forms."[^theog-desc]

[^theog-desc]: "From their shoulders sprang an hundred arms, not to be approached, and each had fifty heads upon his shoulders on their strong limbs, and irresistible was the stubborn strength that was in their great forms." (Theogony 150-153)

## In the Iliad

### Briareus and the Binding of Zeus (Book I)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book I, Achilles recounts how [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md) once saved [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) from being bound by [Hera](../deities/hera.md), [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md), and [Athena](../deities/athena.md). She "summoned to high Olympus him of the hundred arms whom gods call Briareus, but all men call Aigaion; for he is mightier even than his father—so he sate him by Kronion's side rejoicing in his triumph, and the blessed gods feared him withal and bound not Zeus."[^il1-briareus]

This passage introduces the **variant name Aigaion** (used by mortals), and describes Briareus as "mightier even than his father" — a detail not found in the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md).

[^il1-briareus]: "having with speed summoned to high Olympus him of the hundred arms whom gods call Briareus, but all men call Aigaion; for he is mightier even than his father—so he sate him by Kronion's side rejoicing in his triumph, and the blessed gods feared him withal and bound not Zeus" (Iliad I.570-573, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
