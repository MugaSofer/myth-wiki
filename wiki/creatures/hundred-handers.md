## Overview

The **Hundred-Handers** are three monstrous beings, children of [Gaia](../deities/gaia.md) and [Uranus](../deities/uranus.md), described as "great and doughty beyond telling" and "the most terrible" of all Earth and Heaven's children.[^theog-terrible]

[^theog-terrible]: "And again, three other sons were born of Earth and Heaven, great and doughty beyond telling, Cottus and Briareos and Gyes, presumptuous children." ... "For of all the children that were born of Earth and Heaven, these were the most terrible, and they were hated by their own father from the first." (Theogony 147-155, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Description

"From their shoulders sprang an hundred arms, not to be approached, and each had fifty heads upon his shoulders on their strong limbs, and irresistible was the stubborn strength that was in their great forms."[^theog-desc]

[^theog-desc]: "From their shoulders sprang an hundred arms, not to be approached, and each had fifty heads upon his shoulders on their strong limbs, and irresistible was the stubborn strength that was in their great forms." (Theogony 150-153)

## In the Iliad

### Briareus and the Binding of Zeus (Book I)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book I, Achilles recounts how [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md) once saved [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) from being bound by [Hera](../deities/hera.md), [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md), and [Athena](../deities/athena.md). She "summoned to high Olympus him of the hundred arms whom gods call Briareus, but all men call Aigaion; for he is mightier even than his father—so he sate him by Kronion's side rejoicing in his triumph, and the blessed gods feared him withal and bound not Zeus."[^il1-briareus]

This passage introduces the **variant name Aigaion** (used by mortals), and describes Briareus as "mightier even than his father" — a detail not found in the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md).

[^il1-briareus]: "having with speed summoned to high Olympus him of the hundred arms whom gods call Briareus, but all men call Aigaion; for he is mightier even than his father—so he sate him by Kronion's side rejoicing in his triumph, and the blessed gods feared him withal and bound not Zeus" (Iliad 1.395-398, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

## In the Bibliotheca

Apollodorus confirms the Theogonic account and adds that the Hundred-Handers were "unsurpassed in size and might, each of them having a hundred hands and fifty heads."[^apd-hh-desc] He names them in a different order from Hesiod: Briareus, Gyes, Cottus (vs. Cottus, Briareos, Gyes in the Theogony).

After the [Titans](../deities/titans.md) overthrew [Uranus](../deities/uranus.md), [Cronos](../deities/cronos.md) "again bound and shut them up in Tartarus."[^apd-hh-rebound] This double imprisonment — first by Uranus, then by Cronos — is stated more explicitly in Apollodorus than in the Theogony.

In the [Titanomachy](../events/titanomachy.md), [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) "slew their jailoress Campe, and loosed their bonds"[^apd-hh-campe] — the jailoress Campe is a detail not found in the Theogony. After the victory, the gods "appointed the Hundred-handers their guards" over the imprisoned Titans.[^apd-hh-guards]

[^apd-hh-desc]: "he begat first the Hundred-handed, as they are named: Briareus, Gyes, Cottus, who were unsurpassed in size and might, each of them having a hundred hands and fifty heads" (Bibliotheca 1.1.1, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-hh-rebound]: "he again bound and shut them up in Tartarus" (Bibliotheca 1.1.5, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-hh-campe]: "he slew their jailoress Campe, and loosed their bonds" (Bibliotheca 1.2.1, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-hh-guards]: "Armed with these weapons the gods overcame the Titans, shut them up in Tartarus, and appointed the Hundred-handers their guards" (Bibliotheca 1.2.1, trans. Frazer)
