## Overview

**Argos** is a major city and kingdom in the northeastern Peloponnese, central to many mythological cycles. It is associated with the royal line of Inachus and [Io](../heroes/io.md), the asylum of [Danaus](../heroes/danaus.md) and his daughters, the exploits of [Perseus](../heroes/perseus.md), and the House of [Atreus](../heroes/atreus.md). In the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md), "Argos" refers both to the specific city and more broadly to the Greek homeland — the Achaeans are frequently called "Argives."

[Hera](../deities/hera.md) claims Argos as one of her three most beloved cities: "the three towns that I love best are Argos and Sparta and wide-wayed Mycenae."[^il4-hera]

## The Line of Inachus

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) traces Argos's royal line from the river-god Inachus. His daughter [Io](../heroes/io.md) was priestess of [Hera](../deities/hera.md) and beloved of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md). After her transformation and wanderings, Io bore Epaphus in Egypt, from whom descended Libya, Belus, and ultimately [Danaus](../heroes/danaus.md) and Aegyptus.[^apd-line]

## The Danaids at Argos

In Aeschylus' [Suppliant Maidens](../sources/aeschylus-suppliant-maidens.md), [Danaus](../heroes/danaus.md) and his fifty daughters flee Egypt and seek asylum in Argos, claiming descent from [Io](../heroes/io.md) and therefore Argive kinship. King Pelasgus faces the dilemma of protecting the suppliants (honoring Zeus Hikesios) or risking war with the sons of Aegyptus. The Argive assembly votes unanimously to protect them.[^sm-vote]

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) records that Danaus built a ship — the first ever — "by the advice of [Athena](../deities/athena.md)" and sailed to Argos, where the reigning king Gelanor ceded the throne to him.[^apd-danaus]

## The House of Atreus

Through [Pelops](../heroes/pelops.md), [Atreus](../heroes/atreus.md), and [Thyestes](../heroes/thyestes.md), Argos (and the closely associated Mycenae) became the seat of [Agamemnon](../heroes/agamemnon.md)'s kingdom, from which he commanded the Greek expedition against Troy.[^il2-command] After the war, Argos was the setting for the murders and vengeance of the Oresteia cycle.

## In Aeschylus' Eumenides

After his matricide, [Orestes](../heroes/orestes.md) is tried at Athens and acquitted. He promises eternal alliance between Argos and Athens: the friendship shall endure for all time.[^eum-alliance]

## In Aeschylus' Agamemnon

[Clytemnestra](../heroes/clytemnestra.md) describes the relay of beacon fires that carried news of Troy's fall across the sea to Argos.[^ag-beacons] The Chorus of Argive elders serves as the voice of the citizenry throughout the play.
