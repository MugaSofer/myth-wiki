## Overview

**Corinth** was a major Greek city-state located on the isthmus connecting the Peloponnese to central Greece. In mythology, it serves as the setting for significant events, most notably the tragic aftermath of [Jason](../heroes/jason.md) and [Medea](../heroes/medea.md)'s flight from Colchis. The city was ruled by [Creon](../heroes/creon-corinth.md) during the time when [Medea](../heroes/medea.md) arrived there with her children.
