## Overview

The **Areopagus** (Hill of [Ares](../deities/ares.md)) was a rocky hill northwest of the Acropolis in [Athens](athens.md), and the seat of Athens' most ancient court. In myth, [Athena](../deities/athena.md) established the court there to try [Orestes](../heroes/orestes.md) for the murder of his mother [Clytemnestra](../heroes/clytemnestra.md), creating the institution of trial by jury.

## In the Bibliotheca

[Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) records that Orestes, "being afflicted with madness and pursued by the [Furies](../creatures/erinyes.md), repaired to Athens and was tried in the Areopagus... the votes at his trial being equal he was acquitted."[^apd-trial]

## In Aeschylus' Eumenides

The *[Eumenides](../sources/aeschylus-eumenides.md)* dramatizes the founding of the Areopagus. [Athena](../deities/athena.md) declares the matter of Orestes' matricide too great for any single judge and impanels twelve Athenian citizens as jurors. She describes the hill's history: the Amazons "camped of old" there when they attacked Athens in the time of [Theseus](../heroes/theseus.md), "and set against her citadel a counterwork of new sky-pointing towers, and there to Ares held their sacrifice."[^eum-amazons]

Athena ordains the court as a permanent institution: "Here to all time for Aegeus' Attic host / Shall stand this council-court of judges sworn." She charges it to be "pure and unsullied by the lust of gain, sacred and swift to vengeance, wakeful ever to champion men who sleep, the country's guard."[^eum-ordain]
