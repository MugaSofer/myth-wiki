## Overview

**Mount Helicon** is a mountain sacred to the [Muses](../deities/muses.md). It features prominently in the opening of the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md) as the Muses' dwelling place.

## Description

The Muses "hold the great and holy mount of Helicon, and dance on soft feet about the deep-blue spring and the altar of the almighty son of [Cronos](../deities/cronos.md)."[^theog-helicon] On its slopes they bathe "in Permessus or in the Horse's Spring or Olmeius" and "make their fair, lovely dances upon highest Helicon."[^theog-springs]

It was here that the Muses "taught Hesiod glorious song while he was shepherding his lambs under holy Helicon."[^theog-hesiod]

[^theog-helicon]: "From the Heliconian Muses let us begin to sing, who hold the great and holy mount of Helicon, and dance on soft feet about the deep-blue spring and the altar of the almighty son of Cronos" (Theogony 1-4, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^theog-springs]: "when they have washed their tender bodies in Permessus or in the Horse's Spring or Olmeius, make their fair, lovely dances upon highest Helicon" (Theogony 5-7)
