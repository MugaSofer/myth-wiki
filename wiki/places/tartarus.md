## Overview

**Tartarus** is a primordial location (and implicitly a being) that came into existence after [Chaos](../deities/chaos.md) and alongside [Earth](../deities/gaia.md). It serves as the prison of the defeated [Titans](../deities/titans.md) after the [Titanomachy](../events/titanomachy.md).

## Description

Tartarus is described as "dim Tartarus in the depth of the wide-pathed Earth."[^theog-origin] Its distance from the surface is measured cosmically: "a brazen anvil falling down from heaven nine nights and days would reach the earth upon the tenth: and again, a brazen anvil falling from earth nine nights and days would reach Tartarus upon the tenth."[^theog-distance]

"Round it runs a fence of bronze, and night spreads in triple line all about it like a neck-circlet, while above grow the roots of the earth and unfruitful sea."[^theog-fence] [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) "fixed gates of bronze upon it, and a wall runs all round it on every side."[^theog-gates]

The place itself is described as "loathsome and dank, which even the gods abhor" — "a great gulf, and if once a man were within the gates, he would not reach the floor until a whole year had reached its end, but cruel blast upon blast would carry him this way and that. And this marvel is awful even to the deathless gods."[^theog-gulf]

## Inhabitants & Features

### The Titans
"By the counsel of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) who drives the clouds the Titan gods are hidden under misty gloom, in a dank place where are the ends of the huge earth. And they may not go out."[^theog-titans]

[^theog-titans]: "by the counsel of Zeus who drives the clouds the Titan gods are hidden under misty gloom, in a dank place where are the ends of the huge earth. And they may not go out" (Theogony 729-731)

### Warders
The [Hundred-Handers](../creatures/hundred-handers.md) — "Gyes and Cottus and great-souled Obriareus" — serve as "trusty warders of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) who holds the aegis."[^theog-warders]

[^theog-warders]: "There Gyes and Cottus and great-souled Obriareus live, trusty warders of Zeus who holds the aegis." (Theogony 734-735)

### Night and Day
"There stands the awful home of murky [Night](../deities/night.md) wrapped in dark clouds." Before it, Atlas stands "immovably upholding the wide heaven upon his head and unwearying hands." Night and Day "draw near and greet one another as they pass the great threshold of bronze" — one always abroad while the other waits at home.[^theog-nightday]

[^theog-nightday]: "There stands the awful home of murky Night wrapped in dark clouds.

### Sleep and Death
"The children of dark [Night](../deities/night.md) have their dwellings" here — Sleep and Death. Sleep "roams peacefully over the earth and the sea's broad back and is kindly to men; but the other [Death] has a heart of iron, and his spirit within him is pitiless as bronze: whomsoever of men he has once seized he holds fast."[^theog-sleepdeath]

[^theog-sleepdeath]: "And there the children of dark Night have their dwellings, Sleep and Death, awful gods." ...

(Theogony 758-766)

### Hades and Persephone
"The echoing halls of the god of the lower-world, strong [Hades](../deities/hades.md), and of awful [Persephone](../deities/persephone.md)" stand here. A "fearful hound" (unnamed here) guards the entrance: "On those who go in he fawns with his tail and both his ears, but suffers them not to go out back again, but keeps watch and devours whomsoever he catches going out."[^theog-hades]

[^theog-hades]: "There, in front, stand the echoing halls of the god of the lower-world, strong Hades, and of awful Persephone. A fearful hound guards the house in front, pitiless, and he has a cruel trick. On those who go in he fawns with his tail and both his ears, but suffers them not to go out back again, but keeps watch and devours whomsoever he catches going out of the gates" (Theogony 767-774)

### Styx
"Terrible Styx, eldest daughter of back-flowing [Oceanus](../deities/oceanus.md)," dwells here in "her glorious house vaulted over with great rocks and propped up to heaven all round with silver pillars."[^theog-styx]

[^theog-styx]: "And there dwells the goddess loathed by the deathless gods, terrible Styx, eldest daughter of back-flowing Ocean. She lives apart from the gods in her glorious house vaulted over with great rocks and propped up to heaven all round with silver pillars." (Theogony 775-779)

## In the [Aeneid](../sources/aeneid.md)

### The Sibyl's Description (6.548-627)

In the [Aeneid](../sources/aeneid.md), the Sibyl describes Tartarus to [Aeneas](../heroes/aeneas.md) as he sees it from the outside. It is "a wide city, girt with a triple wall and encircled by a racing river of boiling flame, Tartarean Phlegethon."[^aen-tar-walls] The gate is "huge and pillared with solid adamant, that no warring force of men nor the very habitants of heaven may avail to overthrow; it stands up a tower of iron."[^aen-tar-gate] Tisiphone, one of the Furies, "sitting girt in bloodstained pall keeps sleepless watch at the entry by night and day."[^aen-tar-tisiphone]

Within, Rhadamanthus "holds unrelaxing sway, chastises secret crime revealed, and exacts confession."[^aen-tar-rhadamanthus] The Hydra sits within "with her fifty black yawning throats." Tartarus itself "gapes sheer and strikes into the gloom through twice the space that one looks upward to Olympus and the skyey heaven."[^aen-tar-depth]

The punished include the Titans ("Earth's ancient children... hurled down by the thunderbolt"), the Aloads who tried to overthrow heaven, Salmoneus who mimicked [Jupiter](../deities/zeus.md)'s thunder, and Tityos whose liver is eternally devoured by a vulture across "nine full acres."[^aen-tar-tityos] Others "roll a vast stone, or hang outstretched on the spokes of wheels." Phlegyas cries out the warning: "Learn by this warning to do justly and not to slight the gods."[^aen-tar-phlegyas]

[^aen-tar-walls]: "a wide city, girt with a triple wall and encircled by a racing river of boiling flame, Tartarean Phlegethon, that echoes over its rolling rocks" (Aeneid 6.548-551, trans. J.W. Mackail)

[^aen-tar-depth]: "Tartarus' self gapes sheer and strikes into the gloom through twice the space that one looks upward to Olympus and the skyey heaven" (Aeneid 6.577-579)
[^aen-tar-tityos]: "Tityos might be seen, fosterling of Earth the mother of all, whose body stretches over nine full acres, and a monstrous vulture with crooked beak eats away the imperishable liver and the entrails that breed in suffering" (Aeneid 6.595-600)
[^aen-tar-phlegyas]: "Phlegyas in his misery gives counsel to all and witnesses aloud through the gloom, Learn by this warning to do justly and not to slight the gods" (Aeneid 6.618-620)
