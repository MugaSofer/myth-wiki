## Overview

**Scyros** is an island in the Aegean, ruled by King Lycomedes. It is primarily known as the place where [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md) hid the young [Achilles](../heroes/achilles.md) among the king's daughters to prevent him from going to the [Trojan War](../events/trojan-war.md).

## In the Bibliotheca

[Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) reports that Thetis, knowing Achilles was fated to die at Troy, "brought him to Lycomedes" on Scyros. There, "being reared with his daughters, Achilles had a secret intrigue with [Deidamia](../heroes/deidamia.md), daughter of Lycomedes," fathering [Neoptolemus](../heroes/neoptolemus.md).[^apd-scyros]

Scyros is also named as the place where [Theseus](../heroes/theseus.md) was killed: "Lycomedes, who feared lest Theseus should take the island from him, pushed him down from a cliff."[^apd-theseus]

[^apd-scyros]: "His mother Thetis, knowing that he was fated to perish if he went to the war, brought him to Lycomedes" (Bibliotheca 3.13.8, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-theseus]: Epitome 1.24. Theseus killed by Lycomedes on Scyros.

## In the Fabulae

[Hyginus](../sources/hyginus.md) gives the same account: Thetis "sent him to the island of Scyros to King Lycomedes" because an oracle predicted he would die at Troy. There he was "kept among his virgin daughters in woman's attire" and "called Pyrrha because of his tawny hair."[^hyg-scyros]

[^hyg-scyros]: Fabulae §96. Thetis sent Achilles to Scyros to King Lycomedes.

## In the Achilleid

Statius gives the fullest description of the island. Thetis chose it specifically because she had heard "from the unwarlike palace of Lycomedes the sound of maiden bands and the echo of their sport along the shore" — it seemed safe precisely because it was peaceful and remote from war.[^ach-choice]

When Thetis departs after installing Achilles, she prays for the island's silence, comparing it to Crete sheltering the infant [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md): "O land that I love, to whom by timid cunning I have committed the pledge of my anxious care... mayst thou prosper and be silent, I beg, as Crete was silent for [Rhea](../deities/rhea.md)."[^ach-prayer] She promises Scyros "enduring honour and everlasting shrines" and prays it will not be surpassed by "unstable Delos."

The island hosts a festival of [Pallas](../deities/athena.md), "guardian of the shore," and rites of [Bacchus](../deities/dionysus.md) with a three-yearly festival forbidden to men — both of which become settings for key episodes of Achilles' concealment.[^ach-festivals]

[^ach-choice]: "Of late from the unwarlike palace of Lycomedes had she heard the sound of maiden bands and the echo of their sport along the shore" (Achilleid 1.209-210, trans. J.H. Mozley)
[^ach-prayer]: "O land that I love, to whom by timid cunning I have committed the pledge of my anxious care, a trust that is great indeed, mayst thou prosper and be silent, I beg, as Crete was silent for Rhea" (Achilleid 1.384-388)
[^ach-festivals]: Achilleid 1.283-290 (festival of Pallas); 1.593-618 (Bacchic rites).
