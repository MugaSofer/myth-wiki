## Overview

**Mycenae** was one of the wealthiest and most powerful cities in the Greek world, consistently described in Homer as "rich in gold."[^od-gold] It was the seat of [Agamemnon](../heroes/agamemnon.md), commander of the Greek expedition against [Troy](troy.md), and the setting for the bloody history of the House of Atreus. [Hera](../deities/hera.md) counted it among her three dearest cities.[^il-hera]

## Description

### In the Iliad

The Catalogue of Ships names Mycenae first among [Agamemnon](../heroes/agamemnon.md)'s holdings: "of them that possessed the stablished fortress of Mykene and wealthy Corinth and stablished Kleonai."[^il-catalogue] Agamemnon led the largest contingent to Troy — one hundred ships.

[Hera](../deities/hera.md) names Mycenae alongside [Argos](argos.md) and [Sparta](sparta.md) as the cities "dearest far to me": "Argos and Sparta and wide-wayed Mykene; these lay thou waste whene'er they are found hateful to thy heart; not for them will I stand forth, nor do I grudge thee them."[^il-hera]

### In the Odyssey

Homer calls it "Mycenae, rich in gold" when describing [Aegisthus](../heroes/aegisthus.md)'s usurpation: "for seven years he ruled over Mycenae, rich in gold, after he slew the son of Atreus, and the people were subdued unto him."[^od-gold]

## Founding

### In the Bibliotheca

[Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) attributes the founding to [Perseus](../heroes/perseus.md). After accidentally killing his grandfather Acrisius, Perseus "being ashamed to return to Argos to claim the inheritance of him who had died by his hand" exchanged kingdoms with Megapenthes. "Megapenthes reigned over the Argives, and Perseus reigned over Tiryns, after fortifying also Midea and Mycenae."[^apd-founding] Perseus then had sons at Mycenae, including Alcaeus and Sthenelus.[^apd-sons]

Sthenelus's son Eurystheus "reigned also over Mycenae," and it was from there that he imposed the labours on [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md). When [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) declared that "the descendant of Perseus then about to be born would reign over Mycenae," [Hera](../deities/hera.md) contrived to have Eurystheus born first.[^apd-eurystheus]

## The House of Atreus

### The Golden Lamb

The Mycenaeans "received an oracle which bade them choose a Pelopid for their king, and they had sent for Atreus and Thyestes."[^apd-oracle] Thyestes, who had obtained a golden lamb through an affair with Atreus's wife Aerope, claimed the kingship. But [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) intervened: "Zeus sent Hermes to Atreus and told him to stipulate with Thyestes that Atreus should be king if the sun should go backward; and when Thyestes agreed, the sun set in the east." Thus "Atreus got the kingdom and banished Thyestes."[^apd-atreus]

### Thyestes' Revenge

Learning of Aerope's adultery, Atreus lured Thyestes back and "slaughtered the sons, Aglaus, Callileon, and Orchomenus" and served them to their father at a feast. Thyestes later, following an oracle, begot [Aegisthus](../heroes/aegisthus.md) by his own daughter, and "Aegisthus, when he was grown to manhood and had learned that he was a son of Thyestes, killed Atreus, and restored the kingdom to Thyestes."[^apd-aegisthus]

### Agamemnon and After

[Agamemnon](../heroes/agamemnon.md) and [Menelaus](../heroes/menelaus.md), sons of Atreus, eventually regained the throne. From Mycenae, Agamemnon led the Greek expedition against [Troy](troy.md). Upon his return, he was murdered by [Aegisthus](../heroes/aegisthus.md) and [Clytemnestra](../heroes/clytemnestra.md). [Orestes](../heroes/orestes.md) later avenged his father and reclaimed the kingdom.
