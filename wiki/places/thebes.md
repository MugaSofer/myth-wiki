## Overview

**Thebes** is a city in Boeotia, central to many mythological cycles. Its founding by Cadmus, the reign of Oedipus, and the war of the Seven against Thebes are all recorded in the sources. It is called "seven-gated" in both the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) and [Works and Days](../sources/works-and-days.md).

## Founding

### Cadmus and the Dragon's Teeth

According to [Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md), Cadmus, seeking his sister Europa, was told by the oracle at [Delphi](delphi.md) "to be guided by a cow, and to found a city wherever she should fall down for weariness." The cow sank down "where is now the city of Thebes." Cadmus killed a dragon that guarded the spring of [Ares](../deities/ares.md), and "by the advice of [Athena](../deities/athena.md) sowed its teeth. When they were sown there rose from the ground armed men whom they called Sparti."[^apoll-cadmus] Five survived and became the ancestors of the Theban nobility.

After his servitude to Ares, [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) gave Cadmus Harmonia to wife, "and all the gods quitted the sky, and feasting in the Cadmea celebrated the marriage with hymns."[^apoll-wedding]

### Amphion and Zethus

In the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md), Odysseus sees Antiope in the underworld, who "bare two sons, Amphion and Zethus, who founded first the place of seven-gated Thebes, and they made of it a fenced city, for they might not dwell in spacious Thebes unfenced, for all their valiancy."[^od-amphion]

[Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) gives the fuller story: Antiope, daughter of Nycteus, was impregnated by [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) and fled to Sicyon. Lycus pursued her and led her captive; she gave birth to the twins at Eleutherae. Found and raised by a neatherd, "Zethus paid attention to cattle-breeding, but Amphion practised minstrelsy, for [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md) had given him a lyre." They killed Lycus, tied Dirce to a bull, and "having succeeded to the sovereignty they fortified the city, the stones following Amphion's lyre."[^apd-amphion]

Zethus married Thebe, "after whom the city of Thebes is named." Amphion married Niobe, who boasted she was more blessed with children than Latona; [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) killed all the males and [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md) shot down the females. Niobe "quitted Thebes and went to her father Tantalus at Sipylus, and there, on praying to [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md), she was transformed into a stone, and tears flow night and day from the stone."[^apd-niobe]

## Dionysus at Thebes

[Dionysus](../deities/dionysus.md) was born at Thebes, son of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) and Semele, daughter of Cadmus. Semele was tricked by [Hera](../deities/hera.md) into asking Zeus to appear in his true form; "Semele expired of fright, and Zeus, snatching the sixth-month abortive child from the fire, sewed it in his thigh."[^apd-semele]

After his wanderings, Dionysus returned to Thebes and "forced the women to abandon their houses and rave in Bacchic frenzy on Cithaeron. But Pentheus, whom Agave bore to Echion, had succeeded Cadmus in the kingdom, and he attempted to put a stop to these proceedings. And coming to Cithaeron to spy on the Bacchanals, he was torn limb from limb by his mother Agave in a fit of madness."[^apd-pentheus]

## Cadmus's Departure

After the tragedies of his house, "Cadmus and Harmonia quitted Thebes and went to the Encheleans." They led the Encheleans to victory against the Illyrians, and Cadmus reigned over them. "But afterwards he was, along with Harmonia, turned into a serpent and sent away by Zeus to the Elysian Fields."[^apd-cadmus-end]

## The Sphinx

[Hera](../deities/hera.md) sent the [Sphinx](../creatures/sphinx.md) to plague the city: she "had the face of a woman, the breast and feet and tail of a lion, and the wings of a bird. And having learned a riddle from the [Muses](../deities/muses.md), she sat on Mount Phicium, and propounded it to the Thebans."[^apoll-sphinx] The riddle asked what has one voice yet becomes four-footed, two-footed, and three-footed. "When they could not find it the Sphinx used to snatch away one of them and gobble him up."[^apoll-riddle]

## Oedipus

Oedipus solved the riddle, declaring it referred to man. "So the Sphinx threw herself from the citadel, and Oedipus both succeeded to the kingdom and unwittingly married his mother."[^apoll-oedipus] "When the secret afterwards came to light, Jocasta hanged herself in a noose, and Oedipus was driven from Thebes, after he had put out his eyes and cursed his sons."[^apoll-fall]

In the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md), Odysseus sees "the mother of Oedipodes, fair Epicaste, who wrought a dread deed unwittingly, being wedded to her own son, and he that had slain his own father wedded her." Yet "he abode in pain in pleasant Thebes, ruling the Cadmaeans, by reason of the deadly counsels of the gods."[^od-epicaste]

## The Seven Against Thebes

After Oedipus's fall, his sons Eteocles and Polynices agreed to rule alternately, but Eteocles refused to surrender the throne. Polynices fled to Argos and married the daughter of Adrastus, who mustered an army of [seven champions](../events/seven-against-thebes.md) to march on Thebes. [Tiresias](../heroes/tiresias.md) prophesied that the Thebans would be victorious if Menoeceus, son of Creon, sacrificed himself to [Ares](../deities/ares.md) — "Menoeceus, son of Creon, slew himself before the gates."[^apd-menoeceus] Capaneus was struck by [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md)'s thunderbolt while scaling the walls, the brothers killed each other in single combat, and Amphiaraus was swallowed by the earth. See [Seven Against Thebes](../events/seven-against-thebes.md) for the full account.

Afterwards Creon "cast out the Argive dead unburied" and "Antigone, one of the daughters of Oedipus, stole the body of Polynices, and secretly buried it, and having been detected by Creon himself, she was interred alive in the grave."[^apd-antigone]

## The Epigoni

Ten years later, the sons of the fallen champions marched against Thebes under Alcmaeon. The Thebans, on [Tiresias](../heroes/tiresias.md)'s advice, "sent a herald to treat with the Argives, and, mounting their children and women on the wagons, themselves fled from the city." At the spring of Tilphussa, Tiresias drank and died. "The Argives, on learning afterwards the flight of the Thebans, entered the city and collected the booty, and pulled down the walls."[^apd-epigoni]

## In the Epic Cycle

### The Story of Oedipus

The [Epic Cycle](../sources/epic-cycle.md) fragment records of the Sphinx: "But furthermore (she killed) noble Haemon, the dear son of blameless Creon, the comeliest and loveliest of boys."[^epic-sphinx]

### The Thebaid

The Thebaid recounts Oedipus's curse on his sons. When Polyneices served him from Cadmus's silver table and golden cup, "when Oedipus perceived these treasures of his father, great misery fell on his heart, and he straightway called down bitter curses there in the presence of both his sons. And the avenging Fury of the gods failed not to hear him as he prayed that they might never divide their father's goods in loving brotherhood, but that war and fighting might be ever the portion of them both."[^epic-curse]

A later fragment records Oedipus's further curse: "he prayed to Zeus the king and the other deathless gods that each might fall by his brother's hand and go down into the house of Hades."[^epic-curse2]

## In the Works and Days

In [Works and Days](../sources/works-and-days.md), Thebes is named as one of the places where the heroes of the Fourth Age perished: "Grim war and dread battle destroyed a part of them, some in the land of Cadmus at seven-gated Thebe when they fought for the flocks of Oedipus."[^wd-thebes]

## In the Iliad

The [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) contains multiple references to Thebes and the wars fought there. Tlepolemus speaks of Heracles having sacked [Troy](troy.md) previously, and the Theban wars are a constant point of reference for the older generation of heroes.[^il-tydeus]

[^apoll-cadmus]: "falling in with a cow among the herds of Pelagon, he followed it behind. And after traversing Boeotia, it sank down where is now the city of Thebes. Wishing to sacrifice the cow to Athena, he sent some of his companions to draw water from the spring of Ares.
