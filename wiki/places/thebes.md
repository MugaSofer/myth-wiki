## Overview

**Thebes** is a city in Boeotia, central to many mythological cycles. Its founding by Cadmus, the reign of Oedipus, and the war of the Seven against Thebes are all recorded in the sources. It is called "seven-gated" in both the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) and [Works and Days](../sources/works-and-days.md).

## Founding

### Cadmus and the Dragon's Teeth

According to [Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md), Cadmus, seeking his sister Europa, was told by the oracle at [Delphi](delphi.md) "to be guided by a cow, and to found a city wherever she should fall down for weariness." The cow sank down "where is now the city of Thebes." Cadmus killed a dragon that guarded the spring of [Ares](../deities/ares.md), and "by the advice of [Athena](../deities/athena.md) sowed its teeth. When they were sown there rose from the ground armed men whom they called Sparti."[^apoll-cadmus] Five survived and became the ancestors of the Theban nobility.

After his servitude to Ares, [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) gave Cadmus Harmonia to wife, "and all the gods quitted the sky, and feasting in the Cadmea celebrated the marriage with hymns."[^apoll-wedding]

### Amphion and Zethus

In the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md), Odysseus sees Antiope in the underworld, who "bare two sons, Amphion and Zethus, who founded first the place of seven-gated Thebes, and they made of it a fenced city, for they might not dwell in spacious Thebes unfenced, for all their valiancy."[^od-amphion]

## The Sphinx

[Hera](../deities/hera.md) sent the [Sphinx](../creatures/sphinx.md) to plague the city: she "had the face of a woman, the breast and feet and tail of a lion, and the wings of a bird. And having learned a riddle from the [Muses](../deities/muses.md), she sat on Mount Phicium, and propounded it to the Thebans."[^apoll-sphinx] The riddle asked what has one voice yet becomes four-footed, two-footed, and three-footed. "When they could not find it the Sphinx used to snatch away one of them and gobble him up."[^apoll-riddle]

## Oedipus

Oedipus solved the riddle, declaring it referred to man. "So the Sphinx threw herself from the citadel, and Oedipus both succeeded to the kingdom and unwittingly married his mother."[^apoll-oedipus] "When the secret afterwards came to light, Jocasta hanged herself in a noose, and Oedipus was driven from Thebes, after he had put out his eyes and cursed his sons."[^apoll-fall]

In the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md), Odysseus sees "the mother of Oedipodes, fair Epicaste, who wrought a dread deed unwittingly, being wedded to her own son, and he that had slain his own father wedded her." Yet "he abode in pain in pleasant Thebes, ruling the Cadmaeans, by reason of the deadly counsels of the gods."[^od-epicaste]

## In the Epic Cycle

### The Story of Oedipus

The [Epic Cycle](../sources/epic-cycle.md) fragment records of the Sphinx: "But furthermore (she killed) noble Haemon, the dear son of blameless Creon, the comeliest and loveliest of boys."[^epic-sphinx]

### The Thebaid

The Thebaid recounts Oedipus's curse on his sons. When Polyneices served him from Cadmus's silver table and golden cup, "when Oedipus perceived these treasures of his father, great misery fell on his heart, and he straightway called down bitter curses there in the presence of both his sons. And the avenging Fury of the gods failed not to hear him as he prayed that they might never divide their father's goods in loving brotherhood, but that war and fighting might be ever the portion of them both."[^epic-curse]

A later fragment records Oedipus's further curse: "he prayed to Zeus the king and the other deathless gods that each might fall by his brother's hand and go down into the house of Hades."[^epic-curse2]

## In the Works and Days

In [Works and Days](../sources/works-and-days.md), Thebes is named as one of the places where the heroes of the Fourth Age perished: "Grim war and dread battle destroyed a part of them, some in the land of Cadmus at seven-gated Thebe when they fought for the flocks of Oedipus."[^wd-thebes]

## In the Iliad

The [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) contains multiple references to Thebes and the wars fought there. Tlepolemus speaks of Heracles having sacked [Troy](troy.md) previously, and the Theban wars are a constant point of reference for the older generation of heroes.[^il-tydeus]

[^apoll-cadmus]: "falling in with a cow among the herds of Pelagon, he followed it behind. And after traversing Boeotia, it sank down where is now the city of Thebes. Wishing to sacrifice the cow to Athena, he sent some of his companions to draw water from the spring of Ares. But a dragon, which some said was the offspring of Ares, guarded the spring and destroyed most of those that were sent. In his indignation Cadmus killed the dragon, and by the advice of Athena sowed its teeth." (Bibliotheca 3.4.1, trans. Frazer)
