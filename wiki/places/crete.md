## Overview

**Crete** is a large island in the Mediterranean and one of the most significant locations in Greek mythology. It was the birthplace of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md), the seat of King [Minos](../heroes/minos.md)'s maritime empire, and the site of the Labyrinth built by [Daedalus](../heroes/daedalus.md) to contain the Minotaur.

## Birthplace of Zeus

When [Rhea](../deities/rhea.md) was pregnant with [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md), she "repaired to Crete" to escape [Cronos](../deities/cronos.md), "and brought him forth in a cave of Dicte. She gave him to the Curetes and to the nymphs Adrastia and Ida, daughters of Melisseus."[^apd-zeus-birth]

[^apd-zeus-birth]: "Rhea repaired to Crete, when she was big with Zeus, and brought him forth in a cave of Dicte. She gave him to the Curetes and to the nymphs Adrastia and Ida, daughters of Melisseus" (Bibliotheca 1.1.6, trans. Frazer)

## Kingdom of Minos

[Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) brought Europa to Crete after abducting her in the form of a bull: "he mounted her on his back and conveyed her through the sea to Crete. There Zeus bedded with her, and she bore [Minos](../heroes/minos.md), Sarpedon, and Rhadamanthys."[^apd-europa] Asterius, king of Crete, married Europa and raised her sons.

After Asterius died childless, Minos claimed the kingdom as divinely granted. When his claim was opposed, he prayed to [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) to send a bull from the sea as proof, promising to sacrifice it. Poseidon sent the bull, but Minos kept it and sacrificed another. In anger, Poseidon "made the bull savage" and caused Pasiphae to fall in love with it.[^apd-bull]

[Daedalus](../heroes/daedalus.md) constructed the wooden cow for Pasiphae and subsequently built the Labyrinth — "a chamber that with its tangled windings perplexed the outward way" — to contain the Minotaur, Pasiphae's offspring with the bull.[^apd-labyrinth]

[^apd-europa]: "turning himself into a tame bull, he mounted her on his back and conveyed her through the sea to Crete. There Zeus bedded with her, and she bore Minos, Sarpedon, and Rhadamanthys" (Bibliotheca 3.1.1, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-bull]: "Minos prayed that a bull might appear from the depths, promising to sacrifice it. And Poseidon sent up to him a fine bull, and Minos obtained the kingdom, but he sent the bull to the herds and sacrificed another to Poseidon; at which the god was angry and made the bull savage" (Bibliotheca 3.1.3-3.1.4)
[^apd-labyrinth]: "Minos, in compliance with certain oracles, shut him up and guarded him in the Labyrinth. This Labyrinth, which Daedalus constructed, was a chamber 'that with its tangled windings perplexed the outward way'" (Bibliotheca 3.1.4)

## The Cretan Bull

The maddened bull — the same one Poseidon had sent from the sea — ravaged Crete until [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) came as part of his labours. "When, in reply to his request for aid, Minos told him to fight and catch the bull for himself, he caught it and brought it to Eurystheus."[^apd-heracles-bull]

[^apd-heracles-bull]: "Hercules came to Crete, and when, in reply to his request for aid, Minos told him to fight and catch the bull for himself, he caught it and brought it to Eurystheus, and having shown it to him he let it afterwards go free" (Bibliotheca 2.5.7)

## Talos

The bronze guardian Talos protected Crete from invaders. "Some say that he was a man of the Brazen Race, others that he was given to Minos by [Hephaestus](../deities/hephaestus.md); he was a brazen man, but some say that he was a bull." He had "a single vein extending from his neck to his ankles, and a bronze nail was rammed home at the end of the vein." [Medea](../heroes/medea.md) destroyed him during the voyage of the [Argo](../objects/argo.md) — either by driving him mad with drugs, by promising immortality but drawing out the nail, or by the nail being grazed on a stone.[^apd-talos]

[^apd-talos]: "He had a single vein extending from his neck to his ankles, and a bronze nail was rammed home at the end of the vein" (Bibliotheca 1.9.26, trans. Frazer)
