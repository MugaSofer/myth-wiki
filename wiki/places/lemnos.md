## Overview

**Lemnos** is an island that appears frequently across the sources, associated with [Hephaestus](../deities/hephaestus.md)'s fall from heaven, the Lemnian women's massacre of their menfolk, and the Argonauts' visit. In the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) it also serves as a hiding place for Sleep and a waypoint for the slave trade.

## In the Iliad

### Hephaestus's Fall

[Hephaestus](../deities/hephaestus.md) tells the gods of his earlier punishment by [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md): "once ere this, when I was fain to save thee, he caught me by my foot and hurled me from the heavenly threshold; all day I flew, and at the set of sun I fell in Lemnos, and little life was in me. There did the Sintian folk forthwith tend me for my fall."[^il-fall]

### Sleep on Lemnos

In Book XIV, [Hera](../deities/hera.md) travels to Lemnos to enlist Sleep in her scheme against Zeus. "She came to Lemnos, the city of godlike Thoas. There she met Sleep, the brother of Death, and clasped her hand in his."[^il-sleep] Sleep agrees to help after Hera promises him one of the Graces. "The twain left the citadel of Lemnos, and of Imbros, clothed on in mist, and swiftly they accomplished the way."[^il-depart]

### Other References

Lemnos appears as a centre of trade: "many ships from Lemnos, bearing wine" supply the Achaean camp.[^il-wine] Achilles had previously sold Lycaon, a son of Priam, "into well-peopled Lemnos" as a slave.[^il-lycaon]

## In the [Argonautica](../sources/argonautica.md)

The Argonautica gives the fullest account of the Argonauts' stop at Lemnos. The women had killed all the men of the island because [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md) afflicted them with a noisome smell as punishment for dishonouring her; their husbands then brought Thracian slave-women to their beds, and the Lemnian women in their anger murdered all the men on the island. Hypsipyle alone spared her father Thoas by hiding him.[^arg-lemn-women]

When the Argo arrived, the women initially armed and came to the shore in fear. Hypsipyle welcomed the Argonauts and they stayed, consorting with the women. Jason and Hypsipyle became lovers, and she bade him a formal farewell when the heroes finally departed — urged to leave by [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md), who had reproached them for lingering.[^arg-lemn-herc]

Hypsipyle gave Jason a dark robe as a memorial of their time together.[^arg-lemn-cloak]

[^arg-lemn-women]: The women killed all the men of Lemnos because Aphrodite afflicted them for dishonouring her; Hypsipyle spared her father Thoas by hiding him (Argonautica 1.609-639, trans. R.C. Seaton)
[^arg-lemn-herc]: Heracles reproached the heroes for lingering at Lemnos and urged them to depart (Argonautica 1.861-874, trans. R.C. Seaton)
[^arg-lemn-cloak]: Hypsipyle gave Jason "a dark robe... a memorial of many a loving embrace" (Argonautica 3.843-844, trans. R.C. Seaton)

## In the Apollodorus

### Hephaestus's Fall

[Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) gives a parallel account: "Him Zeus cast out of heaven, because he came to the rescue of Hera in her bonds. ... Hephaestus fell on Lemnos and was lamed of his legs, but [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md) saved him."[^apoll-heph]

### The Lemnian Women and the Argonauts

The Argonauts "put to sea and touched at Lemnos. At that time it chanced that Lemnos was bereft of men and ruled over by a queen, Hypsipyle, daughter of Thoas." The reason: "The Lemnian women did not honor [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md), and she visited them with a noisome smell; therefore their spouses took captive women from the neighboring country of Thrace and bedded with them. Thus dishonored, the Lemnian women murdered their fathers and husbands, but Hypsipyle alone saved her father Thoas by hiding him."[^apoll-women]

The Argonauts "had intercourse with the women, and Hypsipyle bedded with Jason and bore sons, Euneus and Nebrophonus."[^apoll-jason]

## In the Odyssey

In the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md), Lemnos is mentioned in the tale of [Ares](../deities/ares.md) and [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md): [Hephaestus](../deities/hephaestus.md) "made as though he would go to Lemnos, that stablished castle" to set his trap.[^od-trap] Ares tells Aphrodite that "Hephaestus is gone to Lemnos, to the Sintians, men of savage speech."[^od-ares]
