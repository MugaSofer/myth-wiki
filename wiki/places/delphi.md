## Overview

**Delphi**, called **Pytho** in the earliest sources, is the seat of [Apollo's](../deities/apollo.md) oracle, located beneath the slopes of Parnassus. According to [Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md), [Themis](../deities/themis.md) delivered oracles there before Apollo, who slew the guardian serpent Python and took over the oracle.[^apoll-themis] The [Homeric Hymn to Apollo](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) gives a detailed account of how Apollo chose the site, slew the she-dragon, founded the temple, and installed Cretan priests to serve it.

## In the Homeric Hymn to Apollo

### Apollo's Search for a Site

After his birth on [Delos](delos.md), Apollo wanders the earth seeking a place for his oracle. He comes first to Telphusa, where the nymph deceives him into moving on, then proceeds to "Crisa beneath snowy Parnassus, a foothill turned towards the west: a cliff hangs over it from above, and a hollow, rugged glade runs under."[^hymn-crisa] There he resolves to build his temple and declares: "In this place I am minded to build a glorious temple to be an oracle for men, and here they will always bring perfect hecatombs."[^hymn-declare]

The temple is built: "the sons of Erginus, Trophonius and Agamedes, dear to the deathless gods, laid a footing of stone. And the countless tribes of men built the whole temple of wrought stones, to be sung of for ever."[^hymn-built]

### The Slaying of the She-Dragon

Near the temple site was "a sweet flowing spring, and there with his strong bow the lord, the son of Zeus, killed the bloated, great she-dragon, a fierce monster wont to do great mischief to men upon earth."[^hymn-dragon] This dragon had received and raised [Typhaon](../creatures/typhoeus.md), whom [Hera](../deities/hera.md) had borne in anger at [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md).

Apollo boasts over the slain dragon: "Now rot here upon the soil that feeds man! You at least shall live no more to be a fell bane to men."[^hymn-boast] The hymn explains that the sun rotted the dragon's body, "wherefore the place is now called Pytho, and men call the lord Apollo by another name, Pythian; because on that spot the power of piercing Helios made the monster rot away."[^hymn-pytho]

### The Cretan Priests

Apollo then brings Cretan sailors to serve as his priests. Appearing to them in the sea as a dolphin, he drives their ship to the shore near Crisa. He reveals himself and commands: "in as much as at the first on the hazy sea I sprang upon the swift ship in the form of a dolphin, pray to me as Apollo Delphinius."[^hymn-delphinius] He then leads the Cretans "to Pytho, marching in time as they chanted the Ie Paean" and "showed them his most holy sanctuary and rich temple."[^hymn-cretans]

When the Cretans worry how they will live in this barren land, Apollo reassures them: "Foolish mortals and poor drudges are you, that you seek cares and hard toils and straits!"[^hymn-reassure]

## In the Iliad

In the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md), Achilles speaks of the great wealth held at Pytho: "neither all the treasure that the stone threshold of the archer Phoebus Apollo encompasseth in rocky Pytho."[^il-treasure]

Pytho also appears in the Catalogue of Ships as one of the towns of Phocis.[^il-catalogue]

## In the Odyssey

Agamemnon once consulted Apollo's oracle at Pytho. The minstrel Demodocus sang of how "Phoebus Apollo in his soothsaying had told him that it must be, in goodly Pytho, what time he crossed the threshold of stone, to seek to the oracle."[^od-pytho]

In the underworld, Odysseus sees Tityos punished for having assaulted [Leto](../deities/leto.md) "as she went up to Pytho through the fair lawns of Panopeus."[^od-tityos]

## In the Apollodorus

Apollo "came to Delphi, where [Themis](../deities/themis.md) at that time used to deliver oracles; and when the snake Python, which guarded the oracle, would have hindered him from approaching the chasm, he killed it and took over the oracle."[^apoll-themis]

Delphi serves throughout the [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) as the place where heroes consult the god: Heracles learns his name and is told to serve Eurystheus;[^apoll-heracles] Cadmus is told to follow a cow and found a city;[^apoll-cadmus] Oedipus learns his fate there.[^apoll-oedipus]

[^apoll-themis]: "Apollo learned the art of prophecy from Pan, the son of Zeus and Hybris, and came to Delphi, where Themis at that time used to deliver oracles; and when the snake Python, which guarded the oracle, would have hindered him from approaching the chasm, he killed it and took over the oracle."

[^hymn-cretans]: "So the Cretans followed him to Pytho, marching in time as they chanted the Ie Paean after the manner of the Cretan paean-singers and of those in whose hearts the heavenly Muse has put sweet-voiced song. With tireless feet they approached the ridge and straightway came to Parnassus and the lovely place where they were to dwell honoured by many men.
