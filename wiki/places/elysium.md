## Overview

**Elysium** is a place of ease and bliss at the edges of the world, set apart from both the mortal lands and the underworld. Two closely related conceptions appear in the sources: the **Elysian plain** described in the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md), and the **Islands of the Blessed** described in [Works and Days](../sources/works-and-days.md). Both are destinations for favoured mortals who escape ordinary death.

## In the Odyssey

In the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md), the sea-god Proteus reveals to Menelaos that he will not die in Argos but will be conveyed by the gods to a place of perpetual mildness:

"the deathless gods will convey thee to the Elysian plain and the world's end, where is Rhadamanthus of the fair hair, where life is easiest for men. No snow is there, nor yet great storm, nor any rain; but always ocean sendeth forth the breeze of the shrill West to blow cool on men."[^od-elysian]

Menelaos earns this fate not through heroism in battle but through kinship with [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md): "yea, for thou hast Helen to wife, and thereby they deem thee to be son of Zeus."[^od-reason]

## In the Works and Days

In [Works and Days](../sources/works-and-days.md), Hesiod describes the fate of the heroes of the Fourth Age -- the "god-like race of hero-men who are called demi-gods." After some perished at seven-gated Thebe and some at [Troy](troy.md), "to the others father Zeus the son of Cronos gave a living and an abode apart from men, and made them dwell at the ends of earth."[^wd-heroes]

Their dwelling is described: "they live untouched by sorrow in the islands of the blessed along the shore of deep swirling Ocean, happy heroes for whom the grain-giving earth bears honey-sweet fruit flourishing thrice a year, far from the deathless gods, and Cronos rules over them; for the father of men and gods released him from his bonds."[^wd-islands]

## In [Pindar](../sources/pindar.md)

### The Islands of the Blessed (Olympian II)

Pindar gives the most vivid description of the afterlife rewards. The righteous dead enjoy "evenly ever in sunlight night and day an unlaborious life," and those who have kept their souls from iniquity through three lives "travel the road of Zeus unto the tower of Kronos."[^pin-tower]

There "round the islands of the blest the Ocean-breezes blow, and golden flowers are glowing, some from the land on trees of splendour, and some the water feedeth, with wreaths whereof they entwine their hands."[^pin-flowers] Rhadamanthys judges there, seated at the right hand of [Cronos](../deities/cronos.md), "husband of [Rhea](../deities/rhea.md), throned above all worlds."[^pin-rhadamanthys]

Named residents include [Peleus](../heroes/peleus.md) and [Kadmos](../heroes/cadmus.md), and [Achilles](../heroes/achilles.md), whose mother [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md) brought him there "when her prayer had moved the heart of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md)."[^pin-achilles]

[^pin-tower]: "whosoever have been of good courage to the abiding steadfast thrice on either side of death and have refrained their souls from all iniquity, travel the road of Zeus unto the tower of Kronos" (Pindar, Olympian II, trans. Ernest Myers)
[^pin-flowers]: "round the islands of the blest the Ocean-breezes blow, and golden flowers are glowing, some from the land on trees of splendour, and some the water feedeth, with wreaths whereof they entwine their hands" (Pindar, Olympian II)
[^pin-rhadamanthys]: "so ordereth Rhadamanthos' just decree, whom at his own right hand hath ever the father Kronos, husband of Rhea, throned above all worlds" (Pindar, Olympian II)
[^pin-achilles]: "Peleus and Kadmos are counted of that company; and the mother of Achilles, when her prayer had moved the heart of Zeus, bare thither her son" (Pindar, Olympian II)

## In the Apollodorus

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) mentions the Elysian Fields and the Islands of the Blessed in several contexts. [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) made Lycus, son of Poseidon and Celaeno, "to dwell in the Islands of the Blest."[^apoll-lycus] Cadmus and Harmonia were "turned into a serpent and sent away by Zeus to the Elysian Fields."[^apoll-cadmus] [Circe](../deities/circe.md) sent Telegonos and Penelope "to the Islands of the Blest."[^apoll-circe]

[^od-elysian]: "the deathless gods will convey thee to the Elysian plain and the world's end, where is Rhadamanthus of the fair hair, where life is easiest for men. No snow is there, nor yet great storm, nor any rain; but always ocean sendeth forth the breeze of the shrill West to blow cool on men" (Odyssey IV.2676-2680, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od-reason]: "yea, for thou hast Helen to wife, and thereby they deem thee to be son of Zeus." (Odyssey IV.2680-2681, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^wd-heroes]: "Zeus the son of Cronos made yet another, the fourth, upon the fruitful earth, which was nobler and more righteous, a god-like race of hero-men who are called demi-gods, the race before our own, throughout the boundless earth." (Works and Days 156-160, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^wd-islands]: "they live untouched by sorrow in the islands of the blessed along the shore of deep swirling Ocean, happy heroes for whom the grain-giving earth bears honey-sweet fruit flourishing thrice a year, far from the deathless gods, and Cronos rules over them; for the father of men and gods released him from his bonds." (Works and Days 170-173, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^apoll-lycus]: "Poseidon made to dwell in the Islands of the Blest" (Bibliotheca 3.10.1, trans. Frazer)
[^apoll-cadmus]: "afterwards he was, along with Harmonia, turned into a serpent and sent away by Zeus to the Elysian Fields" (Bibliotheca 3.5.4, trans. Frazer)
[^apoll-circe]: "Circe sent them both away to the Islands of the Blest." (Bibliotheca E.7.37, trans. Frazer)
