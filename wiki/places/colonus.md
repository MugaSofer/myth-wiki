## Overview

**Colonus** was a deme (district) of [Athens](../places/athens.md), located northwest of the city. It was the site of a sacred grove of the [Eumenides](../creatures/erinyes.md) (the "Dread Goddesses"), and the place where [Oedipus](../heroes/oedipus.md) met his mysterious end.

## In Sophocles' Oedipus at Colonus

The play is named for and set at Colonus. When Oedipus arrives, a stranger describes the place as sacred to "the Maidens / Daughters of Darkness and mysterious Earth" — the Eumenides (~39-40).[^soc-eumenides] The Chorus sings a famous ode praising Colonus as a place where "the sweet-voiced nightingale / Murmurs all day long" amid "the narcissus fair, / Crown of the Great Twin Goddesses from of yore, / And gold-rayed crocus fair" (~668-685).[^soc-ode]

The grove contains the Brazen Threshold, "Earth-rooted... with its brazen stairs" (~1590), where Oedipus paused before his death.[^soc-threshold] Near it stands a rocky basin recording "the pact of [Theseus](../heroes/theseus.md) and Peirithous" (~1593), and the Thorician rock.[^soc-landmarks]

Oedipus's grave at Colonus, known only to [Theseus](../heroes/theseus.md), became a sacred blessing and protection for Athens against future Theban invasion.
