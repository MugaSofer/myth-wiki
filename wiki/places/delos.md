## Overview

**Delos** is the island where [Leto](../deities/leto.md) gave birth to [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md). According to [Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md), the island was formerly called Asteria after [Asteria](../deities/asteria.md), who flung herself into the sea in the form of a quail to escape [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md).[^apoll-asteria] Hunted by [Hera](../deities/hera.md) across the whole earth, Leto came at last to Delos and there brought forth first [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md), by whose midwifery she afterwards gave birth to Apollo.[^apoll-birth]

## In the Homeric Hymn to Apollo

The [Homeric Hymn III](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) gives the fullest account of Delos. As Leto roamed from land to land in travail, no place dared receive her son: "they greatly trembled and feared, and none, not even the richest of them, dared receive Phoebus, until queenly Leto set foot on Delos."[^hymn-fear]

### Delos's Fear and Leto's Oath

Delos herself speaks, welcoming Leto but confessing a fear: that Apollo, once born, will scorn the island and "overturn me and thrust me down with his feet in the depths of the sea."[^hymn-delos-fear] She asks Leto to swear an oath that Apollo will build his first temple there. Leto swears by the water of Styx: "surely Phoebus shall have here his fragrant altar and precinct, and you he shall honour above all."[^hymn-oath]

### The Birth of Apollo

Leto "was racked nine days and nine nights with pangs beyond wont," attended by the chiefest goddesses, while [Eileithyia](../deities/eileithyia.md) was kept away on [Olympus](olympus.md) by Hera's contriving.[^hymn-pangs] When Eileithyia was finally brought to the island, "the pains of birth seized Leto, and she longed to bring forth; so she cast her arms about a palm tree and kneeled on the soft meadow while the earth laughed for joy beneath. Then the child leaped forth to the light."[^hymn-birth]

At his birth, "with gold all Delos was laden, beholding the child of Zeus and Leto, for joy because the god chose her above the islands and shore to make his dwelling in her: and she loved him yet more in her heart, and blossomed as does a mountain-top with woodland flowers."[^hymn-gold]

### The Festival at Delos

The hymn describes the Ionian gathering at Delos in Apollo's honour: "there the long robed Ionians gather in your honour with their children and shy wives: mindful, they delight you with boxing and dancing and song." The poet adds: "A man would say that they were deathless and unageing if he should then come upon the Ionians so met together."[^hymn-ionians]

The maidens of Delos, handmaidens of Apollo, are celebrated as a wonder: "they can imitate the tongues of all men and their clattering speech: each would say that he himself were singing, so close to truth is their sweet song."[^hymn-maidens]

## In the Odyssey

In the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md), Odysseus tells Nausicaa that he once visited Delos and saw there a palm tree by Apollo's altar: "Yet in Delos once I saw as goodly a thing: a young sapling of a palm tree springing by the altar of Apollo."[^od-delos]

## In the Apollodorus

[Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) records that [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md) slew Orion in Delos.[^apoll-orion] He also notes that [Eos](../deities/eos.md) brought Orion to Delos after falling in love with him.[^apoll-eos]
