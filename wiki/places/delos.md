## Overview

**Delos** is the island where [Leto](../deities/leto.md) gave birth to [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md). According to [Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md), the island was formerly called Asteria after [Asteria](../deities/asteria.md), who flung herself into the sea in the form of a quail to escape [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md).[^apoll-asteria] Hunted by [Hera](../deities/hera.md) across the whole earth, Leto came at last to Delos and there brought forth first [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md), by whose midwifery she afterwards gave birth to Apollo.[^apoll-birth]

## In the Homeric Hymn to Apollo

The [Homeric Hymn III](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) gives the fullest account of Delos. As Leto roamed from land to land in travail, no place dared receive her son: "they greatly trembled and feared, and none, not even the richest of them, dared receive Phoebus, until queenly Leto set foot on Delos."[^hymn-fear]

### Delos's Fear and Leto's Oath

Delos herself speaks, welcoming Leto but confessing a fear: that Apollo, once born, will scorn the island and "overturn me and thrust me down with his feet in the depths of the sea."[^hymn-delos-fear] She asks Leto to swear an oath that Apollo will build his first temple there. Leto swears by the water of Styx: "surely Phoebus shall have here his fragrant altar and precinct, and you he shall honour above all."[^hymn-oath]

### The Birth of Apollo

Leto "was racked nine days and nine nights with pangs beyond wont," attended by the chiefest goddesses, while [Eileithyia](../deities/eileithyia.md) was kept away on [Olympus](olympus.md) by Hera's contriving.[^hymn-pangs] When Eileithyia was finally brought to the island, "the pains of birth seized Leto, and she longed to bring forth; so she cast her arms about a palm tree and kneeled on the soft meadow while the earth laughed for joy beneath. Then the child leaped forth to the light."[^hymn-birth]

At his birth, "with gold all Delos was laden, beholding the child of Zeus and Leto, for joy because the god chose her above the islands and shore to make his dwelling in her: and she loved him yet more in her heart, and blossomed as does a mountain-top with woodland flowers."[^hymn-gold]

### The Festival at Delos

The hymn describes the Ionian gathering at Delos in Apollo's honour: "there the long robed Ionians gather in your honour with their children and shy wives: mindful, they delight you with boxing and dancing and song." The poet adds: "A man would say that they were deathless and unageing if he should then come upon the Ionians so met together."[^hymn-ionians]

The maidens of Delos, handmaidens of Apollo, are celebrated as a wonder: "they can imitate the tongues of all men and their clattering speech: each would say that he himself were singing, so close to truth is their sweet song."[^hymn-maidens]

## In Callimachus's Hymns

### Origin as Asteria (Hymn IV.36-50)

[Callimachus](../sources/callimachus-hymns.md) gives the fullest account of the island's wandering origin. When [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) "smote the mountains with the three-forked sword... and wrought the islands in the sea," Delos was not rooted but floated free. Her former name was Asteria, "since like a star thou didst leap from heaven into the deep moat, fleeing wedlock with [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md)." Before she received [Leto](../deities/leto.md), sailors could see her off Troezen one day and find her gone the next — she wandered from the Saronic gulf to Euripus to Sunium to Chios to Samos.[^call-asteria]

### Hera's Persecution and Leto's Wandering (Hymn IV.55-152)

[Hera](../deities/hera.md) set two sentinels to keep all lands from receiving Leto: [Ares](../deities/ares.md) watching the continent from Thracian Haemus, and Iris watching the islands from Mimas. All lands fled from Leto — Arcadia, the Peloponnese (except Aegialos and Argos, which belonged to Hera through Inachus), Boeotia, Thessaly. Even rivers fled: Dirce, Ismenus, Asopus. [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md), still in the womb, prophesied against [Thebes](../places/thebes.md): "Thebe, wherefore, wretched one, dost thou ask the doom that shall be thine anon?" — foretelling Niobe's future punishment.[^call-apollo-womb]

The river Peneius alone showed compassion, offering to receive Leto despite Hera's threats: "Let my destined day take its course. I will endure for thy sake, even if I must wander evermore with ebbing flood." But Ares threatened to hurl the peaks of Pangaeum into his waters and "smote his shield with the point of his spear" until all Thessaly "danced for fear." Leto released him: "Save thyself, farewell!"[^call-peneius]

### Asteria Receives Leto (Hymn IV.196-264)

When all other islands fled, Asteria alone welcomed her: "Hera, do to me what thou wilt. For I heed not thy threats. Cross, cross over, Leto, unto me." Leto "sat by the stream of Inopus... and she loosed her girdle and leaned back her shoulders against the trunk of a palm-tree." Seven swans circled and sang over the birth — hence Apollo strung the lyre with seven strings. "No eighth time sang they: ere that the child leapt forth." At his birth, "all thy foundations became of gold: with gold thy round lake flowed all day, and golden foliage thy natal olive-tree put forth."[^call-birth]

Hera's reaction mixed fury with grudging respect: she was angry at Leto but honoured Asteria "for that she did not desecrate my bed, but instead of Zeus preferred the sea."[^call-hera]

The island took its new name Delos from no longer being "obscure" (*adēlos*) — it rooted itself and became a fixed place.[^call-name]
