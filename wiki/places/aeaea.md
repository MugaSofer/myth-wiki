## Overview

**Aeaea** is the island of [Circe](../deities/circe.md), the enchantress daughter of [Helius](../deities/helius.md) and Perse. It is most extensively described in the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md), where Odysseus and his crew spend a full year there after Circe transforms his men into swine. The [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md) briefly mentions Circe's offspring by Odysseus, and the [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) records the Argonauts' visit for purification.

## In the Theogony

The [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md) names Circe as a daughter of Helius and records that she bore sons to Odysseus: "Circe the daughter of Helius, Hyperion's son, loved steadfast Odysseus and bare Agrius and Latinus who was faultless and strong: also she brought forth Telegonus by the will of golden Aphrodite. And they ruled over the famous Tyrenians, very far off in a recess of the holy islands."[^theog-circe]

## In the Odyssey

### Arrival

After escaping the Laestrygonians, Odysseus and his remaining crew "came to the isle Aeaean, where dwelt Circe of the braided tresses, an awful goddess of mortal speech, own sister to the wizard Aeetes. Both were begotten of Helios, who gives light to all men, and their mother was Perse, daughter of Oceanus."[^od-arrival]

### The Enchantment

Odysseus sends men to explore, and they find Circe's halls, "builded of polished stone, in a place with wide prospect," surrounded by enchanted wolves and lions "whom she herself had bewitched with evil drugs."[^od-beasts] Circe invites the men in, mixes "drugs with the food to make them utterly forget their own country," then "smote them with a wand, and in the styes of the swine she penned them. So they had the head and voice, the bristles and the shape of swine, but their mind abode even as of old."[^od-swine]

### Hermes and the Moly

[Hermes](../deities/hermes.md) meets Odysseus on his way to confront Circe and gives him a protective herb: "the slayer of Argos gave me the plant that he had plucked from the ground, and he showed me the growth thereof. It was black at the root, but the flower was like to milk. Moly the gods call it, but it is hard for mortal men to dig; howbeit with the gods all things are possible."[^od-moly]

Protected by the moly, Odysseus drinks Circe's potion but is not bewitched. She strikes him with her wand, but he draws his sword and springs upon her. Circe recognises him: "Verily thou art Odysseus, ready at need, whom he of the golden wand, the slayer of Argos, full often told me was to come hither, on his way from Troy with his swift black ship."[^od-recognised]

### The Return and Departure

In Book XII, Odysseus returns to Aeaea from the land of the dead. The island is described as "the isle Aeaean, where is the dwelling place of early Dawn and her dancing grounds, and the land of sunrising."[^od-dawn] There Circe instructs them on the dangers ahead: the [Sirens](../creatures/sirens.md), [Scylla](../creatures/scylla.md), and Charybdis.

## In the Apollodorus

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) records two visits to Aeaea. During the voyage of the Argonauts, the crew came "to Aeaea, where they supplicated Circe and were purified" for the murder of Apsyrtus.[^apoll-argo] Later, on Odysseus's wanderings, "with one ship he put in to the Aeaean isle. It was inhabited by Circe, a daughter of the Sun and of Perse, and a sister of Aeetes; skilled in all enchantments was she."[^apoll-odysseus]

[^theog-circe]: "And Circe the daughter of Helius, Hyperion's son, loved steadfast Odysseus and bare Agrius and Latinus who was faultless and strong: also she brought forth Telegonus by the will of golden Aphrodite.
