## Overview

**Sparta** (also called **Lacedaemon**) was a kingdom in the southern Peloponnese, central to many myths as the home of [Menelaus](../heroes/menelaus.md) and [Helen](../heroes/helen.md), the Dioscuri, and [Tyndareus](../heroes/tyndareus.md). Homer describes it as "lying low among the caverned hills."[^od-low] Its palace was one of the most opulent in the Greek world — [Telemachus](../heroes/telemachus.md) compared it to the court of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) himself.

## Description

### In the Odyssey

Homer gives the most vivid picture of Sparta through [Telemachus](../heroes/telemachus.md)'s visit. The city is described as "Lacedaemon lying low among the caverned hills."[^od-low] [Nestor](../heroes/nestor.md) directs Telemachus there to seek news of [Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md): "go now with thy ship and with thy company... to goodly Lacedaemon, where is Menelaus of the fair hair."[^od-nestor-directs]

When Telemachus and Peisistratus arrive, they find [Menelaus](../heroes/menelaus.md) "giving a feast in his house to many friends of his kin, a feast for the wedding of his noble son and daughter."[^od-feast] His daughter [Hermione](../heroes/hermione.md) he was sending to the son of [Achilles](../heroes/achilles.md), "for in Troy he first had promised and covenanted to give her."[^od-hermione]

The palace amazes Telemachus: "there was a gleam as it were of sun or moon through the lofty palace of renowned Menelaus."[^od-gleam] He whispers to Peisistratus: "mark the flashing of bronze through the echoing halls, and the flashing of gold and of amber and of silver and of ivory. Such like, methinks, is the court of Olympian Zeus within, for the world of things that are here; wonder comes over me as I look thereon."[^od-telemachus-wonder]

Menelaus replies that no mortal can vie with Zeus, "but of men there may be who will vie with me in treasure, or there may be none. Yea, for after many a woe and wanderings manifold, I brought my wealth home in ships, and in the eighth year came hither."[^od-menelaus-wealth]

### In the Iliad

In the Catalogue of Ships, Menelaus leads the Spartan contingent: "of them that possessed Lakedaimon lying low amid the rifted hills, and Pharis and Sparta and Messe, the haunt of doves... of these was the king's brother leader, even Menelaos of the loud war-cry, leader of sixty ships."[^il-catalogue]

[Hera](../deities/hera.md) names Sparta among her three dearest cities. When she bargains with Zeus, she says: "of a surety three cities are there that be dearest far to me, Argos and Sparta and wide-wayed Mykene; these lay thou waste whene'er they are found hateful to thy heart; not for them will I stand forth, nor do I grudge thee."[^il-hera]

## Founding and Genealogy

### In the Bibliotheca

[Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) gives the founding genealogy: "Taygete had by Zeus a son Lacedaemon, after whom the country of Lacedaemon is called. Lacedaemon and Sparta, daughter of Eurotas (who was a son of Lelex, a son of the soil, by a Naiad nymph Cleocharia), had a son Amyclas and a daughter Eurydice."[^apd-founding] The kingdom thus takes its name from Lacedaemon, while the city is named for his wife Sparta. Eurotas was himself descended from Lelex, an autochthonous figure — "a son of the soil."

From Amyclas descended the royal line that produced Tyndareus, Icarius, and their families: "Amyclas and Diomede, daughter of Lapithus, had sons, Cynortes and Hyacinth." Hyacinth "was beloved of Apollo and killed by him involuntarily with the cast of a quoit."[^apd-hyacinth] Through Cynortes came Perieres, who "married Gorgophone, daughter of Perseus... and she bore Tyndareus, Icarius, Aphareus, and Leucippus."[^apd-perieres]

### The Return of the Heraclidae

After the Heraclidae conquered the Peloponnese, the cities were divided by lot: "the first drawing was for Argos, the second for Lacedaemon, and the third for Messene."[^apd-lots] Each lot came with an omen: "those who got Lacedaemon found a serpent." The seers interpreted this to mean "those who found the serpent would be terrible in attack."[^apd-serpent]

## Key Events

### Hippocoon and Heracles

[Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) "marched against Lacedaemon, wishing to punish the sons of Hippocoon, for he was angry with them, both because they fought for [Neleus](../heroes/neleus.md), and still angrier because they had killed the son of Licymnius."[^apd-hippocoon] The quarrel began when a Molossian hound rushed at Heracles and he struck it with a stone, "whereupon the Hippocoontids darted out and despatched him with blows of their cudgels." Heracles killed Hippocoon and his sons, "subjugated the city," and "restored Tyndareus and entrusted the kingdom to him."[^apd-tyndareus]

### The Suitors of Helen

Sparta was the gathering-place of [Helen](../heroes/helen.md)'s many suitors, and the oath they swore there — to defend whichever suitor won her — led directly to the [Trojan War](../events/trojan-war.md). The city lost its queen for twenty years.

### Telemachus's Visit

[Athena](../deities/athena.md) sent [Telemachus](../heroes/telemachus.md) to Sparta to seek news of [Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md): "I will guide him to Sparta and to sandy Pylos to seek tidings of his dear father's return, if peradventure he may hear thereof and that so he may be had in good report among men."[^od-athena-plan] Telemachus stayed there a month before Athena came to wake him in Lacedaemon and bid him "be mindful of his return."[^od-month]
