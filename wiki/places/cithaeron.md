## Overview

**Cithaeron** is a mountain on the border of Boeotia and Attica, closely associated with the myths of [Thebes](../places/thebes.md). It was the site where the infant [Oedipus](../heroes/oedipus.md) was exposed, where [Pentheus](../heroes/pentheus.md) was torn apart by the Bacchants, and where [Actaeon](../heroes/actaeon.md) was devoured by his own hounds.

## In the Bibliotheca

[Laius](../heroes/laius.md) "pierced the child's ankles with brooches and gave it to a herdsman to expose" on Cithaeron. The infant was found by neatherds of Polybus and taken to Corinth.[^apd-exposure]

Tiresias's sex-change tradition is also placed here: "he beheld snakes copulating on Cyllene" in some versions, but the Melampodia locates the encounter on Cithaeron.[^mel-tiresias]

## In Sophocles' Oedipus the King

Cithaeron is central to the revelation of Oedipus's identity. The Corinthian messenger explains he received the infant "on Cithaeron's slopes" (~1026).[^sot-cithaeron] After the truth is revealed, [Teiresias](../heroes/tiresias.md)'s earlier words echo: "Ah whither shall thy bitter cry not reach, / What crag in all Cithaeron but shall then / Reverberate thy wail" (~817-819).[^sot-teiresias] Oedipus himself addresses the mountain: "Cithaeron! why didst thou harbor me?" (~1391).[^sot-harbor]
