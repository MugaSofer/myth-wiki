## Overview

**Troy**, called **Ilios** or **Ilion** in the sources, is the walled city of Priam on the plain of the Scamander, and the central location of the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md). Its mythological significance lies especially in its divine connections: its walls were built by gods, its destruction was willed by gods, and it had been sacked once before by Heracles.

## The Walls Built by Gods

### In the Iliad

[Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) tells [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) of their shared history with Troy: "Thou rememberest not all the ills we twain alone of gods endured at Ilios, when by ordinance of Zeus we came to proud Laomedon and served him through a year for promised recompense, and he laid on us his commands. I round their city built the Trojans a wall, wide and most fair, that the city might be unstormed, and thou Phoebus, didst herd shambling crook-horned kine among the spurs of woody many-folded Ida."[^il-wall]

But "then redoubtable Laomedon robbed us of all hire, and sent us off with threats. He threatened that he would bind together our feet and hands and sell us into far-off isles."[^il-cheated]

In Book VII, Poseidon complains that the Achaeans have built their own wall, and "men will forget the wall that I and Phoebus Apollo built with travail for the hero Laomedon."[^il-forget]

### In the Apollodorus

[Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) gives a different but complementary account: "desiring to put the wantonness of Laomedon to the proof, Apollo and Poseidon assumed the likeness of men and undertook to fortify Pergamum for wages. But when they had fortified it, he would not pay them their wages. Therefore Apollo sent a pestilence, and Poseidon a sea monster."[^apoll-fortify]

## The First Sacking by Heracles

Heracles saved Laomedon's daughter Hesione from the sea monster, "promised to save her on condition of receiving from Laomedon the mares which Zeus had given in compensation for the rape of Ganymede." But Laomedon again refused to pay. Heracles later returned "with eighteen ships of fifty oars each" and sacked the city. "Telamon was the first to breach the wall and enter the city." Heracles "shot down Laomedon and his sons, except Podarces," who was ransomed by Hesione and renamed Priam.[^apoll-heracles]

In the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md), Tlepolemus recalls that his father Heracles "erst came hither for Laomedon's mares with but six ships and a scantier host, yet sacked the city of Ilios and made her highways desolate."[^il-heracles] Sarpedon replies that Heracles "verily overthrew holy Ilios by the folly of the proud man Laomedon, that rewarded his good deed with harsh upbraiding."[^il-sarpedon]

## Zeus's Regard for Troy

In the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md), Zeus declares his special affection for the city: "of all cities beneath sun and starry heaven that are the dwelling of mortal men, holy Ilios was most honoured of my heart, and Priam and the folk of Priam of the good ashen spear. For never did mine altar lack the seemly feast, even drink-offering and burnt-offering, the worship that is our due."[^il-zeus]

## The Palladium

[Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) relates that when Ilus founded Ilium, "having prayed to Zeus that a sign might be shown to him, he beheld by day the [Palladium](../objects/palladium.md), fallen from heaven, lying before his tent. It was three cubits in height, its feet joined together; in its right hand it held a spear aloft, and in the other hand a distaff and spindle."[^apd-palladium]

The Palladium was an image of [Athena](../deities/athena.md)'s childhood friend Pallas, whom she had accidentally killed. [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) threw it to Troy, and while it remained within the walls, the city could not be taken. It was eventually stolen by [Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md) and [Diomedes](../heroes/diomedes.md) with [Helen](../heroes/helen.md)'s help (E.5.13).

## Paris and the Firebrand Dream

"When a second babe was about to be born Hecuba dreamed she had brought forth a firebrand, and that the fire spread over the whole city and burned it." Aesacus declared "the child was begotten to be the ruin of his country and advised that the babe should be exposed." The infant was left on Ida, "nursed for five days by a bear," then raised by a servant who named him Paris.[^apd-paris]

Paris later judged the beauty contest between [Hera](../deities/hera.md), [Athena](../deities/athena.md), and [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md) (see [Judgment of Paris](../events/judgment-of-paris.md)), choosing Aphrodite's offer of [Helen](../heroes/helen.md), and so brought about the war.

## In the Fabulae

### The Walls of Troy (§89)

The [Fabulae](../sources/hyginus.md) recounts how the gods built Troy's walls and Laomedon's subsequent betrayal. "[Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) and [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) are said to have built a wall around Troy."[^hyg-wall] King Laomedon made a vow: "he would sacrifice to them from his flocks whatever should be born that year in his kingdom."[^hyg-vow] But "this vow he defaulted on through avarice. Other writers say that he promised too little."[^hyg-default]

The divine punishment was swift: "Because of this [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) sent a sea-monster to plague Troy, and for this reason the king sent to [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) for advice."[^hyg-monster] Apollo's response was harsh: he "angrily replied that if Trojan maidens were bound and offered to the monster, there would be an end to the plague. When many girls had been devoured, and the lot fell on Hesione, and she was bound to the rocks, [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) and Telamon came there."[^hyg-hesione]

Heracles "killed the monster" and "delivered Hesione to her father on condition that when they returned they should take her with them to their country, as well as the horses which walk over water standing ears of grain."[^hyg-rescue] But Laomedon betrayed them again: "Laomedon defaulted in this, too, and refused to give up Hesione."[^hyg-betrayal2]

Heracles returned with force: "assembling ships to attack Troy, came and slew Laomedon, and gave the kingdom to his infant son Podarces, who was afterward called apo tou priasthai, 'from being redeemed,' Priam. He recovered Hesione and gave her in marriage to Telamon."[^hyg-sack]

[^hyg-wall]: "Neptune and Apollo are said to have built a wall around Troy" (Fabulae §89, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-vow]: "King Laomedon vowed that he would sacrifice to them from his flocks whatever should be born that year in his kingdom" (Fabulae §89, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-default]: "This vow he defaulted on through avarice. Other writers say that he promised too little" (Fabulae §89, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-monster]: "Because of this Neptune sent a sea-monster to plague Troy, and for this reason the king sent to Apollo for advice" (Fabulae §89, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-hesione]: "Apollo angrily replied that if Trojan maidens were bound and offered to the monster, there would be an end to the plague. When many girls had been devoured, and the lot fell on Hesione, and she was bound to the rocks, Hercules and Telamon came there" (Fabulae §89, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-rescue]: "killed the monster. They delivered Hesione to her father on condition that when they returned they should take her with them to their country, as well as the horses which walk over water standing ears of grain" (Fabulae §89, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-betrayal2]: "Laomedon defaulted in this, too, and refused to give up Hesione" (Fabulae §89, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-sack]: "Hercules, assembling ships to attack Troy, came and slew Laomedon, and gave the kingdom to his infant son Podarces, who was afterward called apo tou priasthai, 'from being redeemed,' Priam. He recovered Hesione and gave her in marriage to Telamon" (Fabulae §89, trans. Mary Grant)

### Paris's Firebrand Dream (§91)

The Fabulae recounts the ominous portent surrounding Paris's birth. After [Priam](../heroes/priam.md) "had had many children by Hecuba, daughter of Cisseus or of Dymas, his wife, again pregnant, in a dream saw herself giving birth to a glowing firebrand from which many serpents issued."[^hyg-firebrand] The seers interpreted this clearly: "When this vision was reported to all the seers, they bade her slay whatever child she should bear to avoid its being the ruin of the country."[^hyg-prophecy]

After Hecuba gave birth to Paris (called Alexander in the text), "he was handed over to be killed, but the servants out of pity exposed him. Shepherds found the child, raised him as their own, and named him Paris."[^hyg-exposure] The boy grew to manhood among the shepherds until a remarkable recognition scene reunited him with his family. At funeral games held in Paris's own honor (the family believing him dead), he competed and won: "He, out of fondness for the bull, went down and won everything, even over his own brothers."[^hyg-games] When "Deiphobus drew his sword against him" in anger, Paris "leaped to the altar of Zeus Herceus. When Cassandra prophetically declared he was her brother, [Priam](../heroes/priam.md) acknowledged him and received him into the palace."[^hyg-recognition]

[^hyg-firebrand]: "after Priam, son of Laomedon, had had many children by Hecuba, daughter of Cisseus or of Dymas, his wife, again pregnant, in a dream saw herself giving birth to a glowing firebrand from which many serpents issued" (Fabulae §91, trans. Mary Grant)

[^hyg-games]: "servants sent by Priam to bring a bull to be given as prize in funeral games in Paris' honor, came and started to lead off the bull of Paris. He followed them and asked them where they were leading him... He, out of fondness for the bull, went down and won everything, even over his own brothers" (Fabulae §91, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-recognition]: "In anger Deiphobus drew his sword against him, but he leaped to the altar of Zeus Herceus. When Cassandra prophetically declared he was her brother, Priam acknowledged him and received him into the palace" (Fabulae §91, trans. Mary Grant)

### The Trojan Horse (§108)

The Fabulae gives a terse account of Troy's final fall. "Since the Achaeans during ten years were not able to take Troy, Epeus at Minerva's suggestion made a Wooden Horse of remarkable size."[^hyg-horse] The greatest heroes hid within: "in it were gathered Menelaus, Ulysses, Diomedes, Thessander, Sthenelus, Acamas, Thoas, Machaon, Neoptolemus. On the horse they wrote: 'The Danaans give it as a gift to Minerva', and moved camp to Tenedos."[^hyg-inscription]

When the Trojans discovered it, "[Priam](../heroes/priam.md) ordered he horse to be brought to the citadel of Minerva, and gave a proclamation that they celebrate magnificently."[^hyg-celebration] Despite Cassandra's warnings — "the prophetess Cassandra kept insisting that there were enemies within" — "they did not believe her."[^hyg-cassandra] The Trojans' fatal choice: "They put it in the citadel, and at night when they slept, overcome by sport and wine, the Achaeans came out of the horse which had been opened by Sinon, killed the guards at the gates, and at a given signal admitted their friends. Thus they gained possession of Troy."[^hyg-fall]

## The Fall of Troy

After ten years of siege, [Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md) "invented the construction of the [Wooden Horse](../objects/wooden-horse.md) and suggested it to Epeus." The Greeks hid warriors inside and feigned departure. The Trojans "with great joy dragged the horse, and stationing it beside the palace of [Priam](../heroes/priam.md) deliberated what they should do." Cassandra and Laocoon warned them, but "most were in favour of sparing it as a votive offering sacred to a divinity."[^apd-horse]

By night the Greeks emerged: "they opened the horse and came forth with their arms... having opened the gates they admitted their comrades who had landed from Tenedos." Neoptolemus "slew Priam, who had taken refuge at the altar of Zeus of the Courtyard." [Menelaus](../heroes/menelaus.md) slew Deiphobus and recovered Helen. Aeneas "took up his father Anchises and fled, and the Greeks let him alone on account of his piety." They threw Astyanax from the battlements, slaughtered Polyxena on Achilles' grave, and "having slain the Trojans, they set fire to the city."[^apd-fall]

## In the Epic Cycle

The [Epic Cycle](../sources/epic-cycle.md) fragments describe the final fall of Troy. The Sack of Ilium relates that the Greeks built the wooden horse, and "the Trojans were suspicious of the wooden horse and standing round it debated what they ought to do." The city was taken when the Greeks "sailed in from Tenedos, and those in the wooden horse came out."[^epic-sack]

## The Lineage

[Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) traces the royal line: Ilus married Eurydice and begat Laomedon, who begat Tithonus, Priam, and others. "After that Ilium was captured by Hercules, ... Podarces, who was called Priam, came to the throne."[^apoll-lineage]

[^il-wall]: "Thou rememberest not all the ills we twain alone of gods endured at Ilios, when by ordinance of Zeus we came to proud Laomedon and served him through a year for promised recompense, and he laid on us his commands. I round their city built the Trojans a wall, wide and most fair, that the city might be unstormed, and thou Phoebus, didst herd shambling crook-horned kine among the spurs of woody many-folded Ida." (Iliad 21.439-445, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il-cheated]: "then redoubtable Laomedon robbed us of all hire, and sent us off with threats.

[^apoll-heracles]: "Telamon was the first to breach the wall and enter the city, and after him Hercules. ... Hercules thanked him, and when he had taken the city and shot down Laomedon and his sons, except Podarces, he assigned Laomedon's daughter Hesione as a prize to Telamon and allowed her to take with her whomsoever of the captives she would. When she chose her brother Podarces, Hercules said that he must first be a slave and then be ransomed by her. So when he was being sold she took the veil from her head and gave it as a ransom; hence Podarces was called Priam." (Bibliotheca 2.6.4, trans. Frazer)
[^il-heracles]: "my father the steadfast lion-heart, who erst came hither for Laomedon's mares with but six ships and a scantier host, yet sacked the city of Ilios and made her highways desolate." (Iliad 5.641-644, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il-sarpedon]: "he verily overthrew holy Ilios by the folly of the proud man Laomedon, that rewarded his good deed with harsh upbraiding, and paid him not the steeds wherefor he came from afar." (Iliad 5.653-656, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il-zeus]: "of all cities beneath sun and starry heaven that are the dwelling of mortal men, holy Ilios was most honoured of my heart, and Priam and the folk of Priam of the good ashen spear.

[^apd-paris]: "when a second babe was about to be born Hecuba dreamed she had brought forth a firebrand, and that the fire spread over the whole city and burned it... He declared that the child was begotten to be the ruin of his country and advised that the babe should be exposed" (Bibliotheca 3.12.5, trans. J.G. Frazer)
