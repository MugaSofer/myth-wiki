## Overview

**Olympus** is the mountain dwelling of the gods. In the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md), it is repeatedly described as "snowy Olympus" and serves as the home of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) and the other immortals.

## Description

The [Muses](../deities/muses.md) gladden [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) in Olympus with their songs, and "the peaks of snowy Olympus resound" with their voices.[^theog-muses] The gods are said to "hold the peaks of snowy Olympus."[^theog-peaks]

[^theog-muses]: "Come thou, let us begin with the Muses who gladden the great spirit of their father Zeus in Olympus with their songs" ... "the peaks of snowy Olympus resound, and the homes of the immortals." (Theogony 37-44, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^theog-peaks]: "wide-bosomed Earth, the ever-sure foundations of all the deathless ones who hold the peaks of snowy Olympus" (Theogony 118)

## In the Odyssey

In the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md), the poet gives the most famous description of Olympus as a place beyond weather and mortal conditions: "where, as they say, is the seat of the gods that standeth fast for ever. Not by winds is it shaken, nor ever wet with rain, nor doth the snow come nigh thereto, but most clear air is spread about it cloudless, and the white light floats over it. Therein the blessed gods are glad for all their days."[^od6-olympus]

[^od6-olympus]: "where, as they say, is the seat of the gods that standeth fast for ever. Not by winds is it shaken, nor ever wet with rain, nor doth the snow come nigh thereto, but most clear air is spread about it cloudless, and the white light floats over it. Therein the blessed gods are glad for all their days" (Odyssey VI.3520-3525, trans. Butcher and Lang)
