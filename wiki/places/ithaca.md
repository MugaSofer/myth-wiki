## Overview

**Ithaca** is the island kingdom of [Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md), central to the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) as both the hero's homeland and ultimate destination. It is consistently described as a small, rugged island suited to goats rather than horses, but prized by its king above all other places.

## Description

### In the Odyssey

[Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md) himself gives the fullest description when identifying himself to the Phaeacians: "I dwell in clear-seen Ithaca, wherein is a mountain Neriton, with trembling forest leaves, standing manifest to view, and many islands lie around, very near one to the other, Dulichium and Same, and wooded Zacynthus."[^od9-description]

He characterises it plainly: "Now Ithaca lies low, furthest up the sea-line toward the darkness, but those others face the dawning and the sun: a rugged isle, but a good nurse of noble youths; and for myself I can see nought beside sweeter than a man's own country."[^od9-nurse]

[Athena](../deities/athena.md), disguised as a young shepherd when Odysseus first lands on Ithaca's shore, describes it similarly: "it is rough and not fit for the driving of horses, yet is it not a very sorry isle, though narrow withal. For herein is corn past telling, and herein too wine is found, and the rain is on it evermore, and the fresh dew. And it is good for feeding goats and feeding kine; all manner of wood is here, and watering-places unfailing are herein." She adds that "the name of Ithaca hath reached even unto Troy-land, which men say is far from this Achaean shore."[^od13-athena]

### In the Aeneid

[Virgil](../sources/aeneid.md) mentions Ithaca only in passing as [Aeneas](../heroes/aeneas.md) sails past: "We fly past the cliffs of Ithaca, Laërtes' realm, and curse the land, fostress of cruel Ulysses."[^aen-ithaca]

## In the Odyssey

### The Suitors' Occupation

During Odysseus's twenty-year absence — ten at [Troy](troy.md) and ten wandering — young men from Ithaca and the surrounding islands occupied his palace, wooing [Penelope](../heroes/penelope.md) and consuming the household's wealth. [Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) lists the Ithacan suitors specifically: "from Ithaca itself the suitors were twelve, to wit: Antinous, Pronous, Liodes, Eurynomus, Amphimachus, Amphialus, Promachus, Amphimedon, Aristratus, Helenus, Dulicheus, and Ctesippus."[^apd-suitors]

### Odysseus's Return

The Phaeacians conveyed Odysseus to Ithaca while he slept. He did not recognise it at first — Athena had shrouded the island in mist. After revealing herself, she helped him plan the killing of the suitors, disguising him as an old beggar.

### Nearby Islands

[Telemachus](../heroes/telemachus.md)'s return voyage was threatened by suitors lying in ambush: "there is a rocky isle in the mid sea, midway between Ithaca and rugged Samos, Asteris, a little isle; and there is a harbour therein with a double entrance, where ships may ride."[^od4-asteris]

## In the Bibliotheca

After slaying the suitors, Odysseus's later life also centres on Ithaca. Apollodorus records that after adventures among the Thesprotians, Odysseus "handed over the kingdom to his son and repaired to Ithaca, and there he found Poliporthes, whom Penelope had borne to him."[^apd-return] Later, his son [Telegonus](../heroes/telegonus.md) by [Circe](../deities/circe.md) came searching for him: "having come to the island of Ithaca, he drove away some of the cattle, and when Ulysses defended them, Telegonus wounded him with the spear he had in his hands, which was barbed with the spine of a sting-ray, and Ulysses died of the wound."[^apd-death]
