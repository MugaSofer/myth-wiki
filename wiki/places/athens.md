## Overview

**Athens** was the chief city of Attica, sacred to [Athena](../deities/athena.md), who won it from [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) in a contest judged by the twelve gods. The city was governed by a succession of earth-born kings — [Cecrops](../heroes/cecrops.md), Cranaus, Amphictyon, [Erichthonius](../heroes/erichthonius.md), [Pandion](../heroes/pandion.md), [Erechtheus](../heroes/erechtheus.md), and their descendants — before the age of [Theseus](../heroes/theseus.md). The Iliad calls it "the goodly citadel of Athens, the domain of [Erechtheus](../heroes/erechtheus.md) the high-hearted."[^il-athens]

[^il-athens]: "the goodly citadel of Athens, the domain of Erechtheus the high-hearted, whom erst Athene daughter of Zeus fostered when Earth, the grain-giver, brought him to birth; and she gave him a resting-place in Athens in her own rich sanctuary" (Iliad 2.1282-1287, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

## Contest of Athena and Poseidon

The Bibliotheca gives the fullest account. [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) "was the first that came to Attica, and with a blow of his trident on the middle of the acropolis, he produced a sea which they now call Erechtheis."[^apd-poseidon] [Athena](../deities/athena.md) then planted an olive tree, calling on [Cecrops](../heroes/cecrops.md) to witness. [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) "appointed arbiters, not, as some have affirmed, Cecrops and Cranaus, nor yet Erysichthon, but the twelve gods." The country was awarded to Athena "because Cecrops bore witness that she had been the first to plant the olive."[^apd-verdict] Poseidon "in hot anger flooded the Thriasian plain and laid Attica under the sea."[^apd-flood]

The [Fabulae](../sources/hyginus.md) adds that Athens was "said to be the first [city] established in the world" and that [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md), at Zeus's command, forbade Poseidon from flooding the land.[^hyg-164]

[^apd-poseidon]: "Poseidon was the first that came to Attica, and with a blow of his trident on the middle of the acropolis, he produced a sea which they now call Erechtheis" (Bibliotheca 3.14.1, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-verdict]: "the country was adjudged to Athena, because Cecrops bore witness that she had been the first to plant the olive. Athena, therefore, called the city Athens after herself" (Bibliotheca 3.14.1)
[^apd-flood]: "Poseidon in hot anger flooded the Thriasian plain and laid Attica under the sea" (Bibliotheca 3.14.1)
[^hyg-164]: "The city which was first established in the world Minerva is said to have built" (Fabulae §164, trans. Mary Grant)

## The Areopagus

The Areopagus served as a court for divine and heroic trials. [Ares](../deities/ares.md) was the first to be tried there, "impeached by Poseidon" after killing Halirrhothius for attempting to violate his daughter Alcippe. "Ares was tried in the Areopagus before the twelve gods, and was acquitted."[^apd-areopagus] Later, Cephalus was "tried in the Areopagus" and "condemned to perpetual banishment" for killing Procris.[^apd-cephalus]

[^apd-areopagus]: "Impeached by Poseidon, Ares was tried in the Areopagus before the twelve gods, and was acquitted" (Bibliotheca 3.14.2, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-cephalus]: "being tried in the Areopagus, was condemned to perpetual banishment" (Bibliotheca 3.15.1)

## Athena's Presence

The [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) describes Athena returning to Athens after guiding [Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md) to the Phaeacian palace: "grey-eyed Athene departed over the unharvested seas, and left pleasant Scheria, and came to Marathon and wide-wayed Athens, and entered the good house of [Erechtheus](../heroes/erechtheus.md)."[^od-erechtheus]

[Erichthonius](../heroes/erichthonius.md) "set up the wooden image of [Athena](../deities/athena.md) in the acropolis, and instituted the festival of the Panathenaea."[^apd-panathenaea]

[^od-erechtheus]: "grey-eyed Athene departed over the unharvested seas, and left pleasant Scheria, and came to Marathon and wide-wayed Athens, and entered the good house of Erechtheus" (Odyssey 7.86-88, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^apd-panathenaea]: "Erichthonius expelled Amphictyon and became king of Athens; and he set up the wooden image of Athena in the acropolis, and instituted the festival of the Panathenaea" (Bibliotheca 3.14.6)

## Kings of Athens

The Bibliotheca traces the Athenian royal line:

1. **[Cecrops](../heroes/cecrops.md) I** — "a son of the soil, with a body compounded of man and serpent, the first king of Attica"[^apd-cecrops]
2. **Cranaus** — succeeded Cecrops; the flood of Deucalion occurred in his time
3. **Amphictyon** — expelled Cranaus; himself expelled by Erichthonius
4. **[Erichthonius](../heroes/erichthonius.md)** — born from [Hephaestus](../deities/hephaestus.md)'s seed and the earth; raised by Athena; instituted the Panathenaea
5. **[Pandion](../heroes/pandion.md) I** — son of Erichthonius; gave Procne to [Tereus](../heroes/tereus.md); [Demeter](../deities/demeter.md) and [Dionysus](../deities/dionysus.md) came to Attica in his time
6. **[Erechtheus](../heroes/erechtheus.md)** — sacrificed his daughter for victory; killed Eumolpus; destroyed by [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md)
7. **Cecrops II** — eldest son of Erechtheus
8. **[Pandion](../heroes/pandion.md) II** — expelled by sons of Metion; fathered Aegeus at Megara
9. **Aegeus** — father of [Theseus](../heroes/theseus.md)

[^apd-cecrops]: "Cecrops, a son of the soil, with a body compounded of man and serpent, was the first king of Attica, and the country which was formerly called Acte he named Cecropia after himself" (Bibliotheca 3.14.1, trans. Frazer)
