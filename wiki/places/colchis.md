## Overview

**Colchis** is the distant eastern kingdom ruled by Aeetes, son of [Helius](../deities/helius.md) and Perseis, and brother of [Circe](../deities/circe.md). It is the destination of the Argonauts' quest for the Golden Fleece. The principal source is the [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) of [Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md), which gives a detailed account of both the fleece's arrival in Colchis and Jason's mission to retrieve it.

## The Golden Fleece

Phrixus, borne through the sky on a ram with a golden fleece given by [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md), "came to the Colchians, whose king was Aeetes, son of the Sun and of Perseis, and brother of Circe and Pasiphae." Aeetes received him and gave him his daughter Chalciope in marriage. "And Phrixus sacrificed the ram with the golden fleece to Zeus the god of Escape, and the fleece he gave to Aeetes, who nailed it to an oak in a grove of Ares."[^apoll-phrixus]

The fleece remained there, "at Colchis in a grove of Ares, hanging on an oak and guarded by a sleepless dragon."[^apoll-fleece]

## In the [Argonautica](../sources/argonautica.md)

### The Palace of Aeetes

The Argonautica describes Aeetes' palace in detail. It had brazen triglyphs in its construction and four fountains within: one flowing with milk, one with wine, one with fragrant oil, and one with water (hot in winter, cold in summer). These were the work of [Hephaestus](../deities/hephaestus.md).[^arg-col-palace] There were inner courts, extensive gardens, and storerooms.

### The Sacred Grove of Ares

The fleece hung in a sacred grove of [Ares](../deities/ares.md), where "an oak tree of enormous size" spread its branches. The serpent that guarded it never slept.[^arg-col-grove]

### Burial Customs

The Argonautica records a distinctive Colchian custom: "it is an abomination with the Colchians to burn dead men with fire; nor is it lawful to place them in the earth and raise a mound above, but to wrap them in untanned oxhides and suspend them from trees far from the city." Only women were buried in earth.[^arg-col-burial]

[^arg-col-palace]: Aeetes' palace had brazen triglyphs and four fountains — of milk, wine, oil, and water — the work of Hephaestus (Argonautica 3.215-234, trans. R.C. Seaton)
[^arg-col-grove]: The fleece hung on a great oak in the sacred grove of Ares, guarded by a sleepless serpent (Argonautica 2.401-407, trans. R.C. Seaton)
[^arg-col-burial]: "it is an abomination with the Colchians to burn dead men with fire; nor is it lawful to place them in the earth and raise a mound above, but to wrap them in untanned oxhides and suspend them from trees far from the city" (Argonautica 3.200-209, trans. R.C. Seaton)

## The Argonauts at Colchis

"Having sailed past the Thermodon and the Caucasus they came to the river Phasis, which is in the Colchian land."[^apoll-arrival] Jason set forth the charge laid on him by Pelias and asked Aeetes for the fleece. Aeetes promised to give it if Jason would single-handedly yoke the brazen-footed bulls -- "two wild bulls that he had, of enormous size, a gift of [Hephaestus](../deities/hephaestus.md); they had brazen feet and puffed fire from their mouths" -- and sow dragon's teeth.[^apoll-bulls]

Medea, daughter of Aeetes, "conceived a passion for him; now she was a witch." She gave Jason a protective drug and instructed him how to defeat the armed men that would spring from the sown teeth.[^apoll-medea] Jason yoked the bulls and sowed the teeth, but "though the bulls were yoked, Aeetes did not give the fleece; for he wished to burn down the Argo and kill the crew."[^apoll-treachery]

Medea brought Jason by night to the fleece, "and having lulled to sleep by her drugs the dragon that guarded it, she possessed herself of the fleece and in Jason's company came to the Argo."[^apoll-flight]

### The Pursuit

When Aeetes discovered what had happened, he pursued the ship. Medea murdered her brother Apsyrtus and scattered his limbs in the sea to slow her father. "Gathering the child's limbs, Aeetes fell behind in the pursuit; wherefore he turned back, and, having buried the rescued limbs of his child, he called the place Tomi."[^apoll-pursuit] He then "sent out many of the Colchians to search for the Argo, threatening that, if they did not bring Medea to him, they should suffer the punishment due to her."[^apoll-search]

## In the Odyssey

The [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) connects Colchis to [Aeaea](aeaea.md) through kinship: [Circe](../deities/circe.md) is described as "own sister to the wizard Aeetes."[^od-aeetes] The Argo's voyage from Aeetes is mentioned as a famous tale: "the Argo, that is in all men's minds, on her voyage from Aeetes."[^od-argo]

## In the Theogony

The [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md) establishes the lineage: "Perseis, the daughter of Ocean, bare to unwearying Helios Circe and Aeetes the king. And Aeetes, the son of Helios who shows light to men, took to wife fair-cheeked Idyia, daughter of Ocean the perfect stream, by the will of the gods: and she was subject to him in love through golden Aphrodite and bare him neat-ankled Medea."[^theog-aeetes]

[^apoll-phrixus]: "Phrixus came to the Colchians, whose king was Aeetes, son of the Sun and of Perseis, and brother of Circe and Pasiphae, whom Minos married.
