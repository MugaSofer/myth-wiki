## Overview

The sceptre of [Agamemnon](../heroes/agamemnon.md) is a symbol of kingship with a divine lineage spanning five generations. Wrought by [Hephaestus](../deities/hephaestus.md), it passed through the hands of gods and kings before coming to Agamemnon, legitimating his authority "that over many islands and all Argos he should be lord."

## Divine Lineage

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book II, the sceptre's full provenance is given when Agamemnon addresses the assembly: "[Hephaestus](../deities/hephaestus.md) gave it to king [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) son of [Cronos](../deities/cronos.md), and then Zeus gave it to the messenger-god the slayer of Argus; and king [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md) gave it to Pelops the charioteer, and Pelops again gave it to Atreus shepherd of the host. And Atreus dying left it to Thyestes rich in flocks, and Thyestes in his turn left it to Agamemnon to bear, that over many islands and all Argos he should be lord."[^il2-lineage]

The passage traces authority from divine craftsman through father of the gods, to messenger god, to a line of mortal kings — each handoff marking a transmission of legitimate power.

[^il2-lineage]: "Hephaistos gave it to king Zeus son of Kronos, and then Zeus gave it to the messenger-god the slayer of Argus; and king Hermes gave it to Pelops the charioteer, and Pelops again gave it to Atreus shepherd of the host. And Atreus dying left it to Thyestes rich in flocks, and Thyestes in his turn left it to Agamemnon to bear, that over many islands and all Argos he should be lord" (Iliad 2.107-112, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

## In the Odyssey

In [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) Book XI, Agamemnon's shade appears to [Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md) in the underworld. Though he no longer bears the sceptre, his tale of murder by [Clytemnestra](../heroes/clytemnestra.md) and Aegisthus gives a bitter counterpoint to the symbol of authority it once represented.
