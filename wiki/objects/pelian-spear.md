## Overview

The Pelian spear is [Achilles](../heroes/achilles.md)' signature weapon, an ash-wood spear cut from a peak of Mount Pelion by [Chiron](../creatures/chiron.md) the centaur and given to [Peleus](../heroes/peleus.md) at his wedding to [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md). It is the one piece of Achilles' equipment that no other warrior can use.

## Origin

The [Epic Cycle](../sources/epic-cycle.md) (Cypria) records its making as a triple divine gift: "Cheiron gave him a stout ashen shaft which he had cut for a spear, and [Athena](../deities/athena.md), it is said, polished it, and [Hephaestus](../deities/hephaestus.md) fitted it with a head."[^cyp-origin]

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) confirms: "Chiron gave Peleus an ashen spear, and [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) gave him horses, Balius and Xanthus, and these were immortal."[^apd-origin]

[^cyp-origin]: "Cheiron gave him a stout ashen shaft which he had cut for a spear, and Athena, it is said, polished it, and Hephaestus fitted it with a head" (Cypria, Fragment 5, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^apd-origin]: "Chiron gave Peleus an ashen spear, and Poseidon gave him horses, Balius and Xanthus, and these were immortal" (Bibliotheca 3.13.5, trans. J.G. Frazer)

## No Other Man Can Wield It

In the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md), when [Patroclus](../heroes/patroclus.md) borrows Achilles' armour, he takes everything except the spear: "he took not the spear of the noble son of Aiakos, heavy, and huge, and stalwart, that none other of the Achaians could wield, but Achilles alone awaited to wield it, the Pelian ashen spear that Cheiron gave to his father dear, from a peak of Pelion, to be the death of warriors."[^il16-spear]

This detail is significant — even wearing Achilles' divine armour, Patroclus cannot fully become Achilles. The spear marks the irreducible gap between them.

[^il16-spear]: "he took not the spear of the noble son of Aiakos, heavy, and huge, and stalwart, that none other of the Achaians could wield, but Achilles alone awaited to wield it, the Pelian ashen spear that Cheiron gave to his father dear, from a peak of Pelion, to be the death of warriors" (Iliad XVI.9540-9544, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

## In Battle

When Achilles pursues [Hector](../heroes/hector.md), the spear is part of the terrifying image: "nigh on him came Achilles, peer of Enyalios warrior of the waving helm, brandishing from his right shoulder the Pelian ash, his terrible spear; and all around the bronze on him flashed like the gleam of blazing fire or of the Sun as he ariseth. And trembling seized Hector as he was aware of him."[^il22-pursuit]

In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md), Achilles drives his chariot through the Trojan army "making a lane with his great spear, shaped from a Pelion tree."[^met-charge]

[^il22-pursuit]: "nigh on him came Achilles, peer of Enyalios warrior of the waving helm, brandishing from his right shoulder the Pelian ash, his terrible spear; and all around the bronze on him flashed like the gleam of blazing fire or of the Sun as he ariseth. And trembling seized Hector as he was aware of him." (Iliad XXII.12412-12416, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^met-charge]: "Achilles pressed his rapid chariot straight through the Trojan army; making a lane with his great spear, shaped from a Pelion tree" (Metamorphoses 12.72-74, trans. Brookes More)

## Healing Power

In the [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md), the spear has the power to heal wounds it caused. When Telephus was wounded by [Achilles](../heroes/achilles.md) in Mysia, an oracle told him he could only be healed by the one who wounded him. "Achilles healed him by scraping off the rust of his Pelian spear."[^apd-heal]

[^apd-heal]: "Achilles healed him by scraping off the rust of his Pelian spear" (Epitome 3.20, trans. J.G. Frazer)
