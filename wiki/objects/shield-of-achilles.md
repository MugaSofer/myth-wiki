## Overview

The Shield of Achilles is the centrepiece of the divine armour forged by [Hephaestus](../deities/hephaestus.md) for Achilles in [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) XVIII. It replaces the armour originally given to Peleus at his wedding to [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md), which was lost when Hektor stripped it from the body of Patroklos after slaying him. The shield's elaborate description — an *ekphrasis* running over a hundred lines — depicts an entire cosmos in miniature: the heavens and earth, cities at peace and war, agriculture and pastoral life, dance and celebration, all ringed by the River of Ocean.

## The Commission

[Thetis](../deities/thetis.md) comes to [Hephaestus](../deities/hephaestus.md)'s house as a suppliant, recounting her sorrows: her forced marriage to a mortal, her son's fated short life, the quarrel with Agamemnon, and Patroklos's death. She asks: "if haply thou be willing to give my short-lived son shield and helmet, and goodly greaves fitted with ankle-pieces, and cuirass. For the armour that he had erst, his trusty comrade lost when he fell beneath the men of Troy; and my son lieth on the earth with anguish in his soul."[^commission]

Hephaestus answers with a promise: "Be of good courage, let not these things trouble thy heart. Would that so might I avail to hide him far from dolorous death, when dread fate cometh upon him, as surely shall goodly armour be at his need, such as all men afterward shall marvel at, whatsoever may behold."[^promise]

He then goes to his bellows and throws "bronze that weareth not into the fire, and tin and precious gold and silver," sets a great anvil on its stand, and takes hammer and tongs in hand.[^materials] The shield he fashions first: "a shield great and strong, adorning it all over, and set thereto a shining rim, triple, bright-glancing, and therefrom a silver baldric. Five were the folds of the shield itself; and therein fashioned he much cunning work from his wise heart."[^shield-start]

## Description

### The Cosmos

At the centre of the shield, Hephaestus wrought the whole natural order: "the earth, and the heavens, and the sea, and the unwearying sun, and the moon waxing to the full, and the signs every one wherewith the heavens are crowned, Pleiads and Hyads and Orion's might, and the Bear that men call also the Wain, her that turneth in her place and watcheth Orion, and alone hath no part in the baths of Ocean."[^cosmos]

The Bear (Ursa Major) is singled out as the one constellation that never sets below the horizon — "alone hath no part in the baths of Ocean" — a striking astronomical detail that anchors the mythological imagery in observed reality.

[^cosmos]: "There wrought he the earth, and the heavens, and the sea, and the unwearying sun, and the moon waxing to the full, and the signs every one wherewith the heavens are crowned, Pleiads and Hyads and Orion's might, and the Bear that men call also the Wain, her that turneth in her place and watcheth Orion, and alone hath no part in the baths of Ocean" (Iliad XVIII.10783-10788, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

### The City at Peace

The first of two cities depicts mortal life in peacetime. It is a scene of celebration and civic order, combining a wedding procession with a legal dispute:

"In the one were espousals and marriage feasts, and beneath the blaze of torches they were leading the brides from their chambers through the city, and loud arose the bridal song. And young men were whirling in the dance, and among them flutes and viols sounded high; and women standing each at her door were marvelling."[^peace-wedding]

Alongside the wedding, a trial is underway in the assembly: "the folk were gathered in the assembly place; for there a strife was arisen, two men striving about the blood-price of a man slain; the one claimed to pay full atonement, expounding to the people, but the other denied him and would take naught."[^peace-trial] The crowd takes sides, heralds keep order, and elders sit "on polished stones... in the sacred circle, and holding in their hands staves from the loud-voiced heralds. Then before the people they rose up and gave judgment each in turn. And in the midst lay two talents of gold, to be given unto him who should plead among them most righteously."[^peace-judgment]

[^peace-wedding]: "In the one were espousals and marriage feasts, and beneath the blaze of torches they were leading the brides from their chambers through the city, and loud arose the bridal song. And young men were whirling in the dance, and among them flutes and viols sounded high; and women standing each at her door were marvelling" (Iliad XVIII.10791-10795, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^peace-trial]: "the folk were gathered in the assembly place; for there a strife was arisen, two men striving about the blood-price of a man slain; the one claimed to pay full atonement, expounding to the people, but the other denied him and would take naught" (Iliad XVIII.10795-10799, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^peace-judgment]: "the elders on polished stones were sitting in the sacred circle, and holding in their hands staves from the loud-voiced heralds. Then before the people they rose up and gave judgment each in turn. And in the midst lay two talents of gold, to be given unto him who should plead among them most righteously" (Iliad XVIII.10800-10805, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

### The City at War

The second city is under siege. Two armies surround it, debating "either to sack the town or to share all with the townsfolk even whatsoever substance the fair city held within."[^war-siege] The besieged refuse to yield: "On the wall there stood to guard it their dear wives and infant children, and with these the old men; but the rest went forth."[^war-wall]

Their leaders are divine: "their leaders were Ares and Pallas Athene, both wrought in gold, and golden was the vesture they had on. Goodly and great were they in their armour, even as gods, far seen around, and the folk at their feet were smaller."[^war-gods] The warriors set an ambush at a river, and when cattle and herdsmen come to water, they strike — "quickly cut off the herds of oxen and fair flocks of white sheep, and slew the shepherds withal."[^war-ambush]

The besiegers hear the commotion and ride out: "they arrayed their battle and fought beside the river banks, and smote one another with bronze-shod spears."[^war-battle] Among the fighters are personified forces of destruction: "And among them mingled Strife and Tumult, and fell Death, grasping one man alive fresh-wounded, another without wound, and dragging another dead through the mellay by the feet; and the raiment on her shoulders was red with the blood of men."[^war-death] The scene concludes with a final image of brutal equality: "Like living mortals they hurled together and fought, and haled the corpses each of the other's slain."[^war-end]

[^war-siege]: "around the other city were two armies in siege with glittering arms. And two counsels found favour among them, either to sack the town or to share all with the townsfolk even whatsoever substance the fair city held within" (Iliad XVIII.10807-10810, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^war-wall]: "On the wall there stood to guard it their dear wives and infant children, and with these the old men; but the rest went forth" (Iliad XVIII.10811-10812, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^war-gods]: "their leaders were Ares and Pallas Athene, both wrought in gold, and golden was the vesture they had on. Goodly and great were they in their armour, even as gods, far seen around, and the folk at their feet were smaller" (Iliad XVIII.10813-10816, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^war-ambush]: "when they came where it seemed good to them to lay ambush, in a river bed where there was a common watering-place of herds, there they set them, clad in glittering bronze. And two scouts were posted by them afar off to spy the coming of flocks and of oxen with crooked horns. And presently came the cattle, and with them two herdsmen playing on pipes, that took no thought of the guile. Then the others when they beheld these ran upon them and quickly cut off the herds of oxen and fair flocks of white sheep, and slew the shepherds withal" (Iliad XVIII.10816-10824, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^war-battle]: "they arrayed their battle and fought beside the river banks, and smote one another with bronze-shod spears" (Iliad XVIII.10827-10829, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^war-death]: "among them mingled Strife and Tumult, and fell Death, grasping one man alive fresh-wounded, another without wound, and dragging another dead through the mellay by the feet; and the raiment on her shoulders was red with the blood of men" (Iliad XVIII.10829-10832, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^war-end]: "Like living mortals they hurled together and fought, and haled the corpses each of the other's slain" (Iliad XVIII.10832-10834, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

### The Ploughing

The scenes now shift from city life to agriculture. The first is a ploughing scene: "he set in the shield a soft fresh-ploughed field, rich tilth and wide, the third time ploughed; and many ploughers therein drave their yokes to and fro as they wheeled about."[^plough-field] At the end of each furrow, "a man come to each and give into his hands a goblet of sweet wine, while others would be turning back along the furrows, fain to reach the boundary of the deep tilth."[^plough-wine]

The passage concludes with a note on the artistry itself: "the field grew black behind and seemed as it were a-ploughing, albeit of gold, for this was the great marvel of the work."[^plough-marvel] Even wrought in gold, the field appears to darken as if freshly turned — a detail that marvels at [Hephaestus](../deities/hephaestus.md)'s craft.

[^plough-field]: "he set in the shield a soft fresh-ploughed field, rich tilth and wide, the third time ploughed; and many ploughers therein drave their yokes to and fro as they wheeled about" (Iliad XVIII.10836-10839, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^plough-wine]: "a man come to each and give into his hands a goblet of sweet wine, while others would be turning back along the furrows, fain to reach the boundary of the deep tilth" (Iliad XVIII.10839-10842, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^plough-marvel]: "the field grew black behind and seemed as it were a-ploughing, albeit of gold, for this was the great marvel of the work" (Iliad XVIII.10842-10843, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

### The Reaping

The next scene is a harvest on a king's estate: "the demesne-land of a king, where hinds were reaping with sharp sickles in their hands. Some armfuls along the swathe were falling in rows to the earth, whilst others the sheaf-binders were binding in twisted bands of straw."[^reap-sickles] Three sheaf-binders work while boys gather the cut grain and carry it to them constantly.

The king himself stands among them: "the king in silence was standing at the swathe with his staff, rejoicing in his heart."[^reap-king] Meanwhile his henchmen prepare a feast apart: "beneath an oak were making ready a feast, and preparing a great ox they had sacrificed; while the women were strewing much white barley to be a supper for the hinds."[^reap-feast]

[^reap-sickles]: "he set therein the demesne-land of a king, where hinds were reaping with sharp sickles in their hands. Some armfuls along the swathe were falling in rows to the earth, whilst others the sheaf-binders were binding in twisted bands of straw. Three sheaf-binders stood over them, while behind boys gathering corn and bearing it in their arms gave it constantly to the binders" (Iliad XVIII.10845-10851, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^reap-king]: "the king in silence was standing at the swathe with his staff, rejoicing in his heart" (Iliad XVIII.10851-10852, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^reap-feast]: "henchmen apart beneath an oak were making ready a feast, and preparing a great ox they had sacrificed; while the women were strewing much white barley to be a supper for the hinds" (Iliad XVIII.10852-10854, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

### The Vintage

A vineyard scene follows: "a vineyard teeming plenteously with clusters, wrought fair in gold; black were the grapes, but the vines hung throughout on silver poles. And around it he ran a ditch of cyanus, and round that a fence of tin; and one single pathway led to it, whereby the vintagers might go when they should gather the vintage."[^vintage-vineyard] The materials are specified with unusual care — gold grapes, silver poles, a ditch of dark blue cyanus (enamel or lapis lazuli), a tin fence — suggesting distinct bands of colour on the shield's surface.

The grape-gatherers are young: "maidens and striplings in childish glee bare the sweet fruit in plaited baskets."[^vintage-youth] Among them a boy plays music: "in the midst of them a boy made pleasant music on a clear-toned viol, and sang thereto a sweet Linos-song with delicate voice; while the rest with feet falling together kept time with the music and song."[^vintage-song] The Linos-song is a lament, probably for the passing of summer — a bittersweet note amid the harvest joy.

[^vintage-vineyard]: "he set therein a vineyard teeming plenteously with clusters, wrought fair in gold; black were the grapes, but the vines hung throughout on silver poles. And around it he ran a ditch of cyanus, and round that a fence of tin; and one single pathway led to it, whereby the vintagers might go when they should gather the vintage" (Iliad XVIII.10856-10861, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^vintage-youth]: "maidens and striplings in childish glee bare the sweet fruit in plaited baskets" (Iliad XVIII.10861-10862, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

### The Cattle

The pastoral scenes begin with cattle: "a herd of kine with upright horns, and the kine were fashioned of gold and tin, and with lowing they hurried from the byre to pasture beside a murmuring river, beside the waving reed. And herdsmen of gold were following with the kine, four of them, and nine dogs fleet of foot came after them."[^cattle-herd]

But the pastoral calm is broken by predators: "two terrible lions among the foremost kine had seized a loud-roaring bull that bellowed mightily as they haled him, and the dogs and the young men sped after him."[^cattle-lions] The lions are devouring their prey — "rending the great bull's hide were devouring his vitals and his black blood" — while the herdsmen set their dogs on in vain: "they shrank from biting the lions but stood hard by and barked and swerved away."[^cattle-dogs] This scene of sudden violence amid peaceful labour mirrors the larger pattern of the shield, where war intrudes upon peace.

[^cattle-herd]: "he wrought therein a herd of kine with upright horns, and the kine were fashioned of gold and tin, and with lowing they hurried from the byre to pasture beside a murmuring river, beside the waving reed. And herdsmen of gold were following with the kine, four of them, and nine dogs fleet of foot came after them" (Iliad XVIII.10867-10871, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^cattle-lions]: "two terrible lions among the foremost kine had seized a loud-roaring bull that bellowed mightily as they haled him, and the dogs and the young men sped after him" (Iliad XVIII.10871-10873, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^cattle-dogs]: "The lions rending the great bull's hide were devouring his vitals and his black blood; while the herdsmen in vain tarred on their fleet dogs to set on, for they shrank from biting the lions but stood hard by and barked and swerved away" (Iliad XVIII.10874-10877, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

### The Sheep

Briefest of all the scenes: "the glorious lame god wrought therein a pasture in a fair glen, a great pasture of white sheep, and a steading, and roofed huts, and folds."[^sheep] After the violence of the lion attack, this short passage restores a sense of peaceful enclosure — a settled, sheltered world of folds and huts.

[^sheep]: "the glorious lame god wrought therein a pasture in a fair glen, a great pasture of white sheep, and a steading, and roofed huts, and folds" (Iliad XVIII.10879-10881, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

### The Dancing-Place

The final scene before the rim is a great dance, linked to a legendary craftsman: "the glorious lame god devise a dancing-place like unto that which once in wide Knosos Daidalos wrought for Ariadne of the lovely tresses."[^dance-daidalos] The allusion to Daidalos connects Hephaestus to the mortal master-craftsman of Crete, and to the world of Minos and the labyrinth.

The dancers are richly dressed: "youths dancing and maidens of costly wooing, their hands upon one another's wrists. Fine linen the maidens had on, and the youths well-woven doublets faintly glistening with oil. Fair wreaths had the maidens, and the youths daggers of gold hanging from silver baldrics."[^dance-dress]

Their movement is described through two similes of circular motion: "now would they run round with deft feet exceeding lightly, as when a potter sitting by his wheel that fitteth between his hands maketh trial of it whether it run: and now anon they would run in lines to meet each other."[^dance-motion] A crowd watches in delight, and "through the midst of them, leading the measure, two tumblers whirled."[^dance-tumblers]

[^dance-tumblers]: "a great company stood round the lovely dance in joy; and through the midst of them, leading the measure, two tumblers whirled" (Iliad XVIII.10892-10894, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

### The Ocean Rim

The shield's final element encircles all the rest: "he set therein the great might of the River of Ocean around the uttermost rim of the cunningly-fashioned shield."[^ocean] Ocean bounds the world depicted on the shield just as it bounds the world itself in Greek cosmology — the outermost circle containing all human and divine activity within.

[^ocean]: "he set therein the great might of the River of Ocean around the uttermost rim of the cunningly-fashioned shield" (Iliad XVIII.10896-10897, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

## The Full Armour

The shield is part of a complete panoply. After finishing it, Hephaestus forges the remaining pieces: "then wrought he him a corslet brighter than a flame of fire, and he wrought him a massive helmet to fit his brows, goodly and graven, and set thereon a crest of gold, and he wrought him greaves of pliant tin."[^armour]

When [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md) delivers the arms to Achilles, he reacts with awe and fury: "when Achilles looked thereon, then came fury upon him the more, and his eyes blazed terribly forth as it were a flame beneath their lids: glad was he as he held in his hands that splendid gift of a god."[^achilles-reaction] He declares the work beyond mortal ability: "the arms the god has given are such as it beseemeth that the work of Immortals should be, and that no mortal man should have wrought."[^achilles-praise]
