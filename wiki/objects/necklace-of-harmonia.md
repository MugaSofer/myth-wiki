## Overview

The **Necklace of Harmonia** is a divine ornament wrought by [Hephaestus](../deities/hephaestus.md), given to Harmonia (daughter of [Ares](../deities/ares.md) and [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md)) at her wedding to [Cadmus](../heroes/cadmus.md). It becomes a cursed heirloom, bringing destruction to all who possess it — from the bribery of Eriphyle to the murders of Alcmaeon.

### The Wedding Gift (3.4.2)

At the wedding of [Cadmus](../heroes/cadmus.md) and Harmonia, "all the gods quitted the sky, and feasting in the Cadmea celebrated the marriage with hymns. Cadmus gave her a robe and the necklace wrought by [Hephaestus](../deities/hephaestus.md), which some say was given to Cadmus by Hephaestus, but Pherecydes says that it was given by Europa, who had received it from [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md)."[^apd-wedding]

### Bribery of Eriphyle (3.6.2)

Polynices used the necklace to bribe Eriphyle, wife of the seer Amphiaraus, into persuading her husband to join the doomed expedition of the [Seven Against Thebes](../events/seven-against-thebes.md). "Polynices gave her the necklace and begged her to persuade Amphiaraus to march with Adrastus."[^apd-eriphyle]

A generation later, Eriphyle was bribed again — this time with the robe — by Polynices' son Thersander, persuading her own sons to join the Epigoni. "Eriphyle had received the robe from Thersander, son of Polynices, and had persuaded her sons also to go to the war."[^apd-epigoni]

### Alcmaeon's Fate (3.7.5-7)

Alcmaeon killed his mother Eriphyle as Amphiaraus had commanded, then gave the necklace and robe to his first wife Arsinoe. When his second wife Callirrhoe demanded them, he retrieved them by deception and was murdered. Eventually his sons "went to Delphi and dedicated the necklace and robe according to the injunction of Achelous."[^apd-delphi]
