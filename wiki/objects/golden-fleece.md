## Overview

The **Golden Fleece** is the fleece of the divine ram that carried Phrixus and Helle through the sky from Greece to Colchis. After the ram was sacrificed, the fleece was given to King Aeetes and hung in a grove of [Ares](../deities/ares.md), guarded by a sleepless dragon. Retrieving it became the object of Jason's quest with the [Argo](argo.md) and the Argonauts.

## The Ram and its Flight

The golden fleece originated from a ram provided by [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md). When Ino plotted against the children of Athamas by his first wife Nephele, and Phrixus was about to be sacrificed, "Nephele caught him and her daughter up and gave them a ram with a golden fleece, which she had received from Hermes, and borne through the sky by the ram they crossed land and sea."[^apd-flight]

During the flight, "Helle slipped into the deep and was drowned, and the sea was called Hellespont after her."[^apd-helle] The Hesiodic tradition confirms the ram's nature: "This it was that transported Phrixus and Helle. It was immortal and was given them by their mother Nephele, and had a golden fleece, as Hesiod and Pherecydes say."[^hes-ram]

[^apd-flight]: "Nephele caught him and her daughter up and gave them a ram with a golden fleece, which she had received from Hermes, and borne through the sky by the ram they crossed land and sea" (Bibliotheca 1.9.1, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-helle]: "when they were over the sea which lies betwixt Sigeum and the Chersonese, Helle slipped into the deep and was drowned, and the sea was called Hellespont after her" (Bibliotheca 1.9.1, trans. Frazer)
[^hes-ram]: "This it was that transported Phrixus and Helle. It was immortal and was given them by their mother Nephele, and had a golden fleece, as Hesiod and Pherecydes say" (Catalogue of Women, Fragment 38, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## At Colchis

Phrixus reached Colchis, "whose king was Aeetes, son of the Sun and of Perseis, and brother of Circe and Pasiphae."[^apd-aeetes] There "Phrixus sacrificed the ram with the golden fleece to Zeus the god of Escape, and the fleece he gave to Aeetes, who nailed it to an oak in a grove of Ares."[^apd-sacrifice]

The fleece remained in Colchis, "hanging on an oak and guarded by a sleepless dragon."[^apd-guarded] The Hesiodic tradition adds that Phrixus "was received without intermediary because of the fleece," and that after the sacrifice "he purified the fleece and so: 'Holding the fleece he walked into the halls of Aeetes.'"[^hes-phrixus]

[^apd-aeetes]: "Phrixus came to the Colchians, whose king was Aeetes, son of the Sun and of Perseis, and brother of Circe and Pasiphae, whom Minos married" (Bibliotheca 1.9.1, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-sacrifice]: "Phrixus sacrificed the ram with the golden fleece to Zeus the god of Escape, and the fleece he gave to Aeetes, who nailed it to an oak in a grove of Ares" (Bibliotheca 1.9.1, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-guarded]: "it was at Colchis in a grove of Ares, hanging on an oak and guarded by a sleepless dragon" (Bibliotheca 1.9.16, trans. Frazer)
[^hes-phrixus]: "he was received without intermediary because of the fleece... 'Holding the fleece he walked into the halls of Aeetes'" (Aegimius, Fragment 1, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Jason's Quest

Pelias sent Jason to fetch the fleece. When asked what he would command a man prophesied to be his undoing, Jason answered that he "would command him to bring the Golden Fleece."[^apd-command] Jason assembled the Argonauts and sailed aboard the [Argo](argo.md) to Colchis.

At Colchis, Aeetes "promised to give it if single-handed he would yoke the brazen-footed bulls" and sow dragon's teeth.[^apd-tasks] Though Jason completed the tasks, "Aeetes did not give the fleece; for he wished to burn down the Argo and kill the crew."[^apd-refusal]

[^apd-command]: "I would command him to bring the Golden Fleece" (Bibliotheca 1.9.16, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-tasks]: "The other promised to give it if single-handed he would yoke the brazen-footed bulls" (Bibliotheca 1.9.23, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-refusal]: "though the bulls were yoked, Aeetes did not give the fleece; for he wished to burn down the Argo and kill the crew" (Bibliotheca 1.9.23, trans. Frazer)

## The Taking of the Fleece

Medea, daughter of Aeetes, brought Jason to the fleece by night: "having lulled to sleep by her drugs the dragon that guarded it, she possessed herself of the fleece and in Jason's company came to the Argo."[^apd-taking]

After the return voyage, "Jason surrendered the fleece" to Pelias.[^apd-surrender]

[^apd-taking]: "Medea brought Jason by night to the fleece, and having lulled to sleep by her drugs the dragon that guarded it, she possessed herself of the fleece and in Jason's company came to the Argo" (Bibliotheca 1.9.23, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-surrender]: "On his return Jason surrendered the fleece" (Bibliotheca 1.9.27, trans. Frazer)

## In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md)

### Retrieval of the Fleece (7.100-158)

In Ovid's telling, the Golden Fleece is the prize demanded by King Aeetes from [Jason](../heroes/jason.md) and the Argonauts, guarded by a dragon described as "magnificent and terrible with gorgeous crest and triple tongue, and fangs barbed as a javelin."[^met-fleece-1] After Jason subdues the fire-breathing bulls and defeats the earth-born warriors, the dragon remains the final obstacle. Jason sprinkles on its crest "Lethean juices of a magic herb" and recites words "which would becalm the storm-tossed ocean, and would stop the flow of the most rapid rivers of our earth."[^met-fleece-2] With the dragon asleep, "the hero took the Golden Fleece; and proudly sailed away bearing his treasure and the willing maid."[^met-fleece-3]

[^met-fleece-2]: "Lethean juices of a magic herb, and then recited thrice the words which bring deep slumber, potent words which would becalm the storm-tossed ocean" (Metamorphoses 7.152-156, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-fleece-3]: "the hero took the Golden Fleece; and proudly sailed away bearing his treasure and the willing maid" (Metamorphoses 7.155-158, trans. Brookes More)
