## Overview

The **Golden Fleece** is the fleece of the divine ram that carried Phrixus and Helle through the sky from Greece to Colchis. After the ram was sacrificed, the fleece was given to King Aeetes and hung in a grove of [Ares](../deities/ares.md), guarded by a sleepless dragon. Retrieving it became the object of Jason's quest with the [Argo](argo.md) and the Argonauts.

## The Ram and its Flight

The golden fleece originated from a ram provided by [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md). When Ino plotted against the children of Athamas by his first wife Nephele, and Phrixus was about to be sacrificed, "Nephele caught him and her daughter up and gave them a ram with a golden fleece, which she had received from Hermes, and borne through the sky by the ram they crossed land and sea."[^apd-flight]

During the flight, "Helle slipped into the deep and was drowned, and the sea was called Hellespont after her."[^apd-helle] The Hesiodic tradition confirms the ram's nature: "This it was that transported Phrixus and Helle. It was immortal and was given them by their mother Nephele, and had a golden fleece, as Hesiod and Pherecydes say."[^hes-ram]

[^apd-flight]: "Nephele caught him and her daughter up and gave them a ram with a golden fleece, which she had received from Hermes, and borne through the sky by the ram they crossed land and sea" (Bibliotheca 1.9.1, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-helle]: "when they were over the sea which lies betwixt Sigeum and the Chersonese, Helle slipped into the deep and was drowned, and the sea was called Hellespont after her" (Bibliotheca 1.9.1, trans. Frazer)
[^hes-ram]: "This it was that transported Phrixus and Helle. It was immortal and was given them by their mother Nephele, and had a golden fleece, as Hesiod and Pherecydes say" (Catalogue of Women, Fragment 38, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## At Colchis

Phrixus reached Colchis, "whose king was Aeetes, son of the Sun and of Perseis, and brother of Circe and Pasiphae."[^apd-aeetes] There "Phrixus sacrificed the ram with the golden fleece to Zeus the god of Escape, and the fleece he gave to Aeetes, who nailed it to an oak in a grove of Ares."[^apd-sacrifice]

The fleece remained in Colchis, "hanging on an oak and guarded by a sleepless dragon."[^apd-guarded] The Hesiodic tradition adds that Phrixus "was received without intermediary because of the fleece," and that after the sacrifice "he purified the fleece and so: 'Holding the fleece he walked into the halls of Aeetes.'"[^hes-phrixus]

[^apd-aeetes]: "Phrixus came to the Colchians, whose king was Aeetes, son of the Sun and of Perseis, and brother of Circe and Pasiphae, whom Minos married" (Bibliotheca 1.9.1, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-sacrifice]: "Phrixus sacrificed the ram with the golden fleece to Zeus the god of Escape, and the fleece he gave to Aeetes, who nailed it to an oak in a grove of Ares" (Bibliotheca 1.9.1, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-guarded]: "it was at Colchis in a grove of Ares, hanging on an oak and guarded by a sleepless dragon" (Bibliotheca 1.9.16, trans. Frazer)
[^hes-phrixus]: "he was received without intermediary because of the fleece... 'Holding the fleece he walked into the halls of Aeetes'" (Aegimius, Fragment 1, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Jason's Quest

Pelias sent Jason to fetch the fleece. When asked what he would command a man prophesied to be his undoing, Jason answered that he "would command him to bring the Golden Fleece."[^apd-command] Jason assembled the Argonauts and sailed aboard the [Argo](argo.md) to Colchis.

At Colchis, Aeetes "promised to give it if single-handed he would yoke the brazen-footed bulls" and sow dragon's teeth.[^apd-tasks] Though Jason completed the tasks, "Aeetes did not give the fleece; for he wished to burn down the Argo and kill the crew."[^apd-refusal]

[^apd-command]: "I would command him to bring the Golden Fleece" (Bibliotheca 1.9.16, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-tasks]: "The other promised to give it if single-handed he would yoke the brazen-footed bulls" (Bibliotheca 1.9.23, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-refusal]: "though the bulls were yoked, Aeetes did not give the fleece; for he wished to burn down the Argo and kill the crew" (Bibliotheca 1.9.23, trans. Frazer)

## The Taking of the Fleece

Medea, daughter of Aeetes, brought Jason to the fleece by night: "having lulled to sleep by her drugs the dragon that guarded it, she possessed herself of the fleece and in Jason's company came to the Argo."[^apd-taking]

After the return voyage, "Jason surrendered the fleece" to Pelias.[^apd-surrender]

[^apd-taking]: "Medea brought Jason by night to the fleece, and having lulled to sleep by her drugs the dragon that guarded it, she possessed herself of the fleece and in Jason's company came to the Argo" (Bibliotheca 1.9.23, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-surrender]: "On his return Jason surrendered the fleece" (Bibliotheca 1.9.27, trans. Frazer)

## In the [Argonautica](../sources/argonautica.md)

### The Fleece at Colchis

Apollonius describes the fleece hanging in the sacred grove of [Ares](../deities/ares.md), guarded by a serpent of enormous size: "the fleece as it hung on the leafy branches of an oak," while "a dragon, a monster terrible to behold, ever glares around, keeping watch over the fleece that is spread upon the top of an oak; neither by day nor by night does sweet sleep subdue his restless eyes."[^arg2-grove] Argus son of Phrixus warned of the guardian: "so huge a serpent keeps guard round and about it, deathless and sleepless, which Earth herself brought forth on the sides of Caucasus, by the rock of Typhaon."[^arg2-serpent-origin]

### Taking the Fleece

[Medea](../heroes/medea.md) sang the serpent to sleep and sprinkled its eyes with juniper and charms. The fleece on the tree "blushes red with the fiery beams of the rising sun."[^arg4-color] When [Jason](../heroes/jason.md) snatched it, the fleece gleamed brilliantly: "from the shimmering of the flocks of wool there settled on his fair cheeks and brow a red flush like a flame."[^arg4-glow] Its size and weight were remarkable: "great as is the hide of a yearling ox or stag, which huntsmen call a brocket, so great in extent was the fleece all golden above. Heavy it was, thickly clustered with flocks; and as he moved along, even beneath his feet the sheen rose up from the earth."[^arg4-size]

### The Phrixus Backstory

The sons of Phrixus reported that their father "came to the city of Aeetes, bestriding a ram, which [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md) had made all gold... The ram, at its own prompting, he then sacrificed to Zeus, son of [Cronos](../deities/cronos.md), above all, the god of fugitives."[^arg2-phrixus] At the bridal site where the Argo moored for the wedding, the fleece was spread on the couch: "thereon they laid the glittering fleece of gold, that so the marriage might be made honoured and the theme of song. And for them nymphs gathered flowers... and a splendour as of flame played round them all, such a light gleamed from the golden tufts."[^arg4-wedding]

[^arg2-grove]: "a dragon, a monster terrible to behold, ever glares around, keeping watch over the fleece that is spread upon the top of an oak; neither by day nor by night does sweet sleep subdue his restless eyes" (Argonautica 2.1851-1853)
[^arg2-serpent-origin]: "so huge a serpent keeps guard round and about it, deathless and sleepless, which Earth herself brought forth on the sides of Caucasus, by the rock of Typhaon" (Argonautica 2.2563-2565)
[^arg4-color]: The fleece on the oak was "like to a cloud that blushes red with the fiery beams of the rising sun" (Argonautica 4.4011-4012)
[^arg4-glow]: "from the shimmering of the flocks of wool there settled on his fair cheeks and brow a red flush like a flame" (Argonautica 4.4048-4049)
[^arg4-size]: "great as is the hide of a yearling ox or stag, which huntsmen call a brocket, so great in extent was the fleece all golden above. Heavy it was, thickly clustered with flocks; and as he moved along, even beneath his feet the sheen rose up from the earth" (Argonautica 4.4049-4053)
[^arg2-phrixus]: "Phrixus, who came to the city of Aeetes, bestriding a ram, which Hermes had made all gold... The ram, at its own prompting, he then sacrificed to Zeus, son of Cronos, above all, the god of fugitives" (Argonautica 2.2504-2507)
[^arg4-wedding]: "thereon they laid the glittering fleece of gold, that so the marriage might be made honoured and the theme of song. And for them nymphs gathered flowers of varied hue and bore them thither in their white bosoms; and a splendour as of flame played round them all, such a light gleamed from the golden tufts" (Argonautica 4.4903-4907)

## In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md)

### Retrieval of the Fleece (7.100-158)

In Ovid's telling, the Golden Fleece is the prize demanded by King Aeetes from [Jason](../heroes/jason.md) and the Argonauts, guarded by a dragon described as "magnificent and terrible with gorgeous crest and triple tongue, and fangs barbed as a javelin."[^met-fleece-1] After Jason subdues the fire-breathing bulls and defeats the earth-born warriors, the dragon remains the final obstacle. Jason sprinkles on its crest "Lethean juices of a magic herb" and recites words "which would becalm the storm-tossed ocean, and would stop the flow of the most rapid rivers of our earth."[^met-fleece-2] With the dragon asleep, "the hero took the Golden Fleece; and proudly sailed away bearing his treasure and the willing maid."[^met-fleece-3]

[^met-fleece-1]: "magnificent and terrible with gorgeous crest and triple tongue, and fangs barbed as a javelin, guards the Golden Fleece" (Metamorphoses 7.149-152, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-fleece-2]: "Lethean juices of a magic herb, and then recited thrice the words which bring deep slumber, potent words which would becalm the storm-tossed ocean" (Metamorphoses 7.152-156, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-fleece-3]: "the hero took the Golden Fleece; and proudly sailed away bearing his treasure and the willing maid" (Metamorphoses 7.155-158, trans. Brookes More)

## In [Pindar](../sources/pindar.md)

### The Fleece in Pythian IV

Pindar's Pythian IV gives a full narrative of the quest for the Golden Fleece. Pelias framed his mission to Jason in terms of an obligation to Phrixos's ghost: the fleece was "the thick-fleeced hide of the ram, whereby of old he was delivered from the deep and from the impious weapons of his stepmother."[^pin-ram-hide] The oracle at Kastalia had charged Pelias "to send a ship on the sacred mission."

Aietes described the fleece to Jason in these terms: "This work let your king, whosoever he be that hath command of the ship, accomplish me, and then let him bear away with him the imperishable coverlet, the fleece glittering with tufts of gold."[^pin-coverlet]

Pindar describes the fleece's guardian and location: "it lay in a thick wood and grasped by a terrible dragon's jaws, and he in length and thickness was larger than their ship of fifty oars."[^pin-dragon-desc] Jason slew this dragon "by subtlety" with Medea's aid, and "stole away" the fleece.[^pin-subtlety]

[^pin-ram-hide]: "bring thence the thick-fleeced hide of the ram, whereby of old he was delivered from the deep and from the impious weapons of his stepmother" (Pindar, Pythian IV, trans. Ernest Myers)
[^pin-coverlet]: "This work let your king, whosoever he be that hath command of the ship, accomplish me, and then let him bear away with him the imperishable coverlet, the fleece glittering with tufts of gold" (Pindar, Pythian IV, trans. Ernest Myers)
[^pin-dragon-desc]: "it lay in a thick wood and grasped by a terrible dragon's jaws, and he in length and thickness was larger than their ship of fifty oars, which the iron's blows had welded" (Pindar, Pythian IV, trans. Ernest Myers)
[^pin-subtlety]: "The glaring speckled dragon, O Arkesilas, he slew by subtlety, and by her own aid he stole away Medea, the murderess of Pelias" (Pindar, Pythian IV, trans. Ernest Myers)
