## Overview

The lyre was invented by [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md) on the day of his birth and later given to [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md), becoming his signature instrument.

## Invention

"Born with the dawning, at mid-day he played on the lyre." Finding a tortoise at the threshold of his cave, Hermes "first made the tortoise a singer" — cutting it open, stretching ox hide over the shell, and fitting "seven strings of sheep-gut." He immediately sang of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) and Maia, "telling all the glorious tale of his own begetting."[^hh4-lyre]

[^hh4-lyre]: "Born with the dawning, at mid-day he played on the lyre... For it was Hermes who first made the tortoise a singer" (Homeric Hymn IV to Hermes 17, 25, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## The Exchange

When Hermes played the lyre for [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md), "the sweet throb of the marvellous music went to his heart, and a soft longing took hold on his soul." Apollo declared: "this song of yours is worth fifty cows."[^hh4-exchange] Hermes gave Apollo the lyre, and Apollo gave Hermes his shining whip and ordained him keeper of herds. [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) "made them both friends."

[^hh4-exchange]: "the sweet throb of the marvellous music went to his heart, and a soft longing took hold on his soul... Verily this is worth fifty cows" (Homeric Hymn IV to Hermes 455-457, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Apollo and the Lyre

After receiving the lyre, Apollo becomes inseparable from it. In the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md), it is "through the [Muses](../deities/groups/muses.md) and far-shooting Apollo that there are singers and harpers upon the earth."[^theog-song]

[^theog-song]: "For it is through the Muses and far-shooting Apollo that there are singers and harpers upon the earth; but princes are of Zeus" (Theogony 94-96, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
