# Aphrodite's Girdle

|---|---|
| **Also known as** | The broidered girdle, the cestus |
| **Owner** | [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md) |
| **First appearance** | [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) XIV |

## Overview

The **girdle of [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md)** is an enchanted, broidered band containing all the goddess's powers of love and desire. In the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md), [Hera](../deities/hera.md) borrows it to seduce [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) and distract him from the Trojan War.

## Description

The girdle is described in vivid detail when Aphrodite removes it: "from her breast she loosed the broidered girdle, fair-wrought, wherein are all her enchantments; therein are love, and desire, and loving converse, that steals the wits even of the wise."[^il14-girdle]

When [Hera](../deities/hera.md) asks for it, she frames her request in terms of Aphrodite's power: "Give me now Love and Desire wherewith thou dost overcome all the Immortals, and mortal men."[^il14-request] Aphrodite consents freely: "Take now this girdle and lay it up in thy bosom, this broidered girdle wherein all my enchantments are."[^il14-gift]

The girdle proves devastatingly effective. Zeus is overcome with desire for Hera and falls asleep, allowing [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) to aid the Greeks while Zeus's attention is diverted.
