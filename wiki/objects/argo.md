## Overview

The **Argo** is the ship built for Jason's quest to retrieve the [Golden Fleece](golden-fleece.md) from Colchis. Built by Argus with divine assistance from [Athena](../deities/athena.md), the Argo was distinctive for its ability to speak, thanks to a timber from the prophetic oak of Dodona fitted into its prow. The [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) calls it "Argo, that is in all men's minds" — the most famous ship in Greek tradition.

## Construction

"Sent to fetch the fleece, Jason called in the help of Argus, son of Phrixus; and Argus, by Athena's advice, built a ship of fifty oars named Argo after its builder; and at the prow Athena fitted in a speaking timber from the oak of Dodona."[^apd-construction]

The ship was thus a collaboration: Argus built the hull, and [Athena](../deities/athena.md) provided the prophetic element — the timber from Dodona, where [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md)'s oracle spoke through the rustling of oak leaves.

[^apd-construction]: "Sent to fetch the fleece, Jason called in the help of Argus, son of Phrixus; and Argus, by Athena's advice, built a ship of fifty oars named Argo after its builder; and at the prow Athena fitted in a speaking timber from the oak of Dodona" (Bibliotheca 1.9.16, trans. Frazer)

## The Speaking Ship

The Argo's ability to speak with a human voice appears at several critical moments in Apollodorus.

### Heracles Left Behind

According to one tradition, the Argo itself declared it could not carry [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md): "Pherecydes says that he was left behind at Aphetae in Thessaly, the Argo having declared with human voice that she could not bear his weight."[^apd-heracles] This is one of several variant explanations for why Heracles did not complete the voyage (others say he was searching for Hylas, or serving Omphale).

[^apd-heracles]: "Pherecydes says that he was left behind at Aphetae in Thessaly, the Argo having declared with human voice that she could not bear his weight" (Bibliotheca 1.9.19, trans. Frazer)

### The Wrath of Zeus

After the murder of Apsyrtus (Medea's brother), "[Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) sent a furious storm upon them, and drove them out of their course, because he was angry at the murder of Apsyrtus. And as they were sailing past the Apsyrtides Islands, the ship spoke, saying that the wrath of Zeus would not cease unless they journeyed to Ausonia and were purified by Circe for the murder of Apsyrtus."[^apd-speaks]

The Argonauts obeyed the ship's direction and "skirted Tyrrhenia and came to Aeaea, where they supplicated Circe and were purified."[^apd-circe]

[^apd-speaks]: "the ship spoke, saying that the wrath of Zeus would not cease unless they journeyed to Ausonia and were purified by Circe for the murder of Apsyrtus" (Bibliotheca 1.9.24, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-circe]: "they skirted Tyrrhenia and came to Aeaea, where they supplicated Circe and were purified" (Bibliotheca 1.9.24, trans. Frazer)

## The Voyage

### Key Episodes

The Argo endured numerous perils on the voyage. The ship passed through the Clashing Rocks (Symplegades), encountered the giant Talos on Crete — "when he saw the Argo standing inshore, he pelted it as usual with stones"[^apd-talos] — and was steered through Charybdis, [Scylla](../creatures/scylla.md), and the Wandering Rocks by [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md) and the Nereids "at the summons of [Hera](../deities/hera.md)."[^apd-thetis]

The Hesiodic tradition records that the Argonauts "came through the Ocean to Libya, and so, carrying the Argo, reached our sea."[^hes-libya]

The entire voyage was completed "in four months."[^apd-duration]

[^apd-talos]: "when he saw the Argo standing inshore, he pelted it as usual with stones" (Bibliotheca 1.9.26, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-thetis]: "Thetis with the Nereids steered the ship through them at the summons of Hera" (Bibliotheca 1.9.25, trans. Frazer)
[^hes-libya]: "they came through the Ocean to Libya, and so, carrying the Argo, reached our sea" (Catalogue of Women, Fragment, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^apd-duration]: "they sailed betwixt Euboea and Locris and came to Iolcus, having completed the whole voyage in four months" (Bibliotheca 1.9.26, trans. Frazer)

## In the [Argonautica](../sources/argonautica.md)

### Construction

Apollonius provides a detailed account of the Argo's construction. Argus built the ship "by [Athena](../deities/athena.md)'s counsel," and she "set in the centre of the stem" a beam "made of Dodonian oak" that could speak with a human voice.[^arg1-build] The ship was named after its builder, and Tiphys served as helmsman, having been "urged by Athena" to join the voyage.[^arg1-tiphys]

[^arg1-build]: The ship was built by Argus with Athena's guidance; the prophetic beam of Dodonian oak was set in the stem (Argonautica 1, cf. 4.4412)
[^arg1-tiphys]: Tiphys, son of Hagnias, served as helmsman, urged by Athena (Argonautica 1)

### The Symplegades

When the Argo attempted the passage through the Clashing Rocks, [Athena](../deities/athena.md) intervened directly: "with her left hand thrust back one mighty rock and with her right pushed the ship through; and she, like a winged arrow, sped through the air."[^arg2-athena] The rocks "shore off as she passed the extreme end of the stern-ornament."[^arg2-rocks] Tiphys credited the ship's divine construction: "Athena breathed into Argo divine strength when Argus knitted her together with bolts; and she may not be caught."[^arg2-tiphys-praise]

[^arg2-athena]: "Athena with her left hand thrust back one mighty rock and with her right pushed the ship through; and she, like a winged arrow, sped through the air" (Argonautica 2.2025-2026)
[^arg2-rocks]: "the rocks, ceaselessly clashing, shore off as she passed the extreme end of the stern-ornament" (Argonautica 2.2027-2028)
[^arg2-tiphys-praise]: "Athena breathed into Argo divine strength when Argus knitted her together with bolts; and she may not be caught" (Argonautica 2.2038-2039)

### The Speaking Ship

After the murder of Apsyrtus, [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) ordained purification, and "on a sudden there called to them in the midst of their course, speaking with a human voice, the beam of the hollow ship, which Athena had set in the centre of the stem, made of Dodonian oak."[^arg4-speaks] The voice "proclaimed that they should not escape the paths of an endless sea nor grievous tempests, unless [Circe](../deities/circe.md) should purge away the guilt of the ruthless murder of Apsyrtus."[^arg4-proclaim]

[^arg4-speaks]: "on a sudden there called to them in the midst of their course, speaking with a human voice, the beam of the hollow ship, which Athena had set in the centre of the stem, made of Dodonian oak" (Argonautica 4.4411-4412)
[^arg4-proclaim]: "it proclaimed that they should not escape the paths of an endless sea nor grievous tempests, unless Circe should purge away the guilt of the ruthless murder of Apsyrtus" (Argonautica 4.4414-4416)

### The Wandering Rocks

[Thetis](../deities/thetis.md) and the Nereids physically guided the Argo through the Wandering Rocks: "they in turn one from another sent the ship through the air over the waves, as it sped on ever away from the rocks."[^arg4-nereids] The image was of "maidens near some sandy beach" who "sport with a shapely-rounded ball... they catch it one from another and send it high into the air; and it never touches the ground."[^arg4-ball]

[^arg4-nereids]: "they in turn one from another sent the ship through the air over the waves, as it sped on ever away from the rocks" (Argonautica 4.4738-4739)
[^arg4-ball]: "even as maidens near some sandy beach roll their garments up to their waists out of their way and sport with a shapely-rounded ball; then they catch it one from another and send it high into the air; and it never touches the ground" (Argonautica 4.4734-4737)

### Carried Overland

In Libya, the heroes carried the Argo overland for twelve days across the desert to reach Lake Tritonis, "by your might and your valour over the desert sands of Libya raised high aloft on your shoulders the ship and all that ye brought therein."[^arg4-carried]

[^arg4-carried]: "by your might and your valour over the desert sands of Libya raised high aloft on your shoulders the ship and all that ye brought therein, and bare her twelve days and nights alike" (Argonautica 4.5109-5112)

## In the Odyssey

The [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) refers to the Argo as a ship known to all: "One ship only of all that fare by sea hath passed that way, even Argo, that is in all men's minds, on her voyage from Aeetes. And even her the wave would lightly have cast there upon the mighty rocks, but Here sent her by for love of Jason."[^od12-argo]

This passage places the Argo's voyage in the narrative past of the Homeric world and confirms [Hera](../deities/hera.md)'s patronage of the expedition.

[^od12-argo]: "One ship only of all that fare by sea hath passed that way, even Argo, that is in all men's minds, on her voyage from Aeetes. And even her the wave would lightly have cast there upon the mighty rocks, but Here sent her by for love of Jason" (Odyssey XII.6597-6600, trans. Butcher and Lang)

## Dedication

After the return, "he sailed with the chiefs to the Isthmus and dedicated the ship to Poseidon."[^apd-dedication]

[^apd-dedication]: "he sailed with the chiefs to the Isthmus and dedicated the ship to Poseidon" (Bibliotheca 1.9.27, trans. Frazer)

## The Crew

Apollodorus provides a detailed catalogue of the Argonauts, including: Tiphys (helmsman), Orpheus, Zetes and Calais (sons of Boreas), Castor and Pollux (sons of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md)), Telamon and Peleus (sons of Aeacus), [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md), Theseus, Idas and Lynceus, Amphiaraus, Atalanta, Laertes, Autolycus, Meleager, Euphemus, Poeas, and many others.[^apd-crew]

[^apd-crew]: "Tiphys, son of Hagnias, who steered the ship; Orpheus, son of Oeagrus; Zetes and Calais, sons of Boreas; Castor and Pollux, sons of Zeus; Telamon and Peleus, sons of Aeacus; Hercules, son of Zeus; Theseus, son of Aegeus; Idas and Lynceus, sons of Aphareus; Amphiaraus, son of Oicles..."
