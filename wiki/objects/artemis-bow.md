## Overview

The golden bow is [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md)'s defining weapon, paired with golden arrows. Where her brother [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) carries a [silver bow](apollos-bow.md), Artemis's is consistently described as golden — a distinction maintained across multiple sources.

## Description

[Homeric Hymn XXVII](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) gives the fullest picture of the bow in action: "Over the shadowy hills and windy peaks she draws her golden bow, rejoicing in the chase, and sends out grievous shafts. The tops of the high mountains tremble and the tangled wood echoes awesomely with the outcry of beasts."[^hh27-hunt] After hunting, she goes to [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md)'s house at Delphi where "this huntress who delights in arrows slackens her supple bow" and "hangs up her curved bow and her arrows."[^hh27-rest]

Her arrows bring sudden, painless death to women — the female counterpart to Apollo's gentle darts for men. In the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md), Penelope prays for death by Artemis's arrows: "Would that Artemis, the fair goddess, would give me a death so soft, even now."[^od-penelope]

[^hh27-hunt]: "Over the shadowy hills and windy peaks she draws her golden bow, rejoicing in the chase, and sends out grievous shafts. The tops of the high mountains tremble and the tangled wood echoes awesomely with the outcry of beasts: earthquakes and the sea also where fishes shoal" (Homeric Hymn XXVII to Artemis 4-10, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^hh27-rest]: "this huntress who delights in arrows slackens her supple bow and goes to the great house of her dear brother Phoebus Apollo, to the rich land of Delphi... There she hangs up her curved bow and her arrows, and heads and leads the dances, gracefully arrayed" (Homeric Hymn XXVII to Artemis 12-18)
[^od-penelope]: "Would that Artemis, the fair goddess, would give me a death so soft, even now" (Odyssey XVIII.10082-10083, trans. Butcher and Lang)

## At Her Birth

In [Homeric Hymn III](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) (to Apollo), Artemis is "she who delights in arrows" from the very first mention. [Homeric Hymn IX](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) calls her "the virgin who delights in arrows, who was fostered with Apollo."[^hh9-arrows]

[^hh9-arrows]: "Muse, sing of Artemis, sister of the Far-shooter, the virgin who delights in arrows, who was fostered with Apollo" (Homeric Hymn IX to Artemis 1-2, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## In the Iliad

Artemis's bow appears in the battle between gods in [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) XXI, where [Hera](../deities/hera.md) seizes it and uses it to beat her: "smiling, she caught both her hands in her left and with her right took the bow from her shoulders, and therewith, smiling, beat her on the ears as she turned this way and that, and the swift arrows fell out of the quiver." Artemis "fled weeping" and left her bow behind.[^il21-bow]

In the Bibliotheca, the bow is used in deadlier fashion: "Artemis shot Callisto and killed her" and "Artemis slew Orion."[^apd-callisto]

[^il21-bow]: "smiling, she caught both her hands in her left and with her right took the bow from her shoulders, and therewith, smiling, beat her on the ears as she turned this way and that, and the swift arrows fell out of the quiver" (Iliad XXI.12191-12193, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^apd-callisto]: "Artemis shot Callisto and killed her" (Bibliotheca 3.8.2, trans. Frazer)
