| **Owner** | [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) |
| **Made by** | The [Cyclopes](../creatures/cyclopes.md) |
| **First appearance** | [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md) 15 |

## Overview

The trident is [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md)'s signature weapon, as closely associated with him as the [thunderbolt](thunderbolt.md) is with [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) and the [helm of invisibility](helm-of-hades.md) with [Hades](../deities/hades.md). These three weapons were gifts from the [Cyclopes](../creatures/cyclopes.md) to the three brothers, forged in gratitude for their liberation.

## Origin

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) specifies the Cyclopes as makers: "they gave Zeus thunder and lightning and a thunderbolt, and on Pluto they bestowed a helmet, and on Poseidon a trident. Armed with these weapons, they overcame the Titans."[^apd-origin]

[^apd-origin]: "they gave Zeus thunder and lightning and a thunderbolt, and on Pluto they bestowed a helmet, and on Poseidon a trident. Armed with these weapons, they overcame the Titans" (Bibliotheca 1.2.1, trans. J.G. Frazer)

## Powers

The trident commands the sea and shakes the earth:

- **Earthquake:** In the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md), Poseidon uses his trident in the Theomachy: "from beneath Poseidon made the vast earth shake, and the steep tops of the mountains," so that [Hades](../deities/hades.md) "leapt from his throne and cried aloud."[^il20-earthquake]
- **Destruction:** After the Trojan War, Poseidon "with his trident in his hands... sent forth into the waves all the foundations of beams and stones" of the Achaian wall, scouring the beach clean.[^il12-wall]
- **Smiting rock:** In the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md), Poseidon destroys the Locrian Aias: "Poseidon struck the Gyraean rock with his great trident and cleft it in twain."[^od4-aias]
- **Turning ships to stone:** He turns the Phaeacian ship into rock with a single blow — striking it "into a stone, and rooted it far below," and threatening to raise a mountain around their city.[^od13-stone]
- **Flood and earthquake:** In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md), during Zeus's great flood, "Neptune smites the Earth with his trident: she trembles and through her agitation lays open new channels for the waters."[^met-flood]

[^il20-earthquake]: "from beneath Poseidon made the vast earth shake, and the steep tops of the mountains. All the roots of many-fountained Ida were shaken, and all her crests, and the city of the Trojans, and the ships of the Achaians" (Iliad 20.115-119, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il12-wall]: "the Shaker of the earth, with his trident in his hands, was himself the leader, and sent forth into the waves all the foundations of beams and stones that the Achaians had laid with toil" (Iliad 12.31-34)
[^od4-aias]: "Poseidon struck the great rock with the flat of his hands, and cleft it in twain... the one part fell in the sea... and bore Aias with it" (Odyssey 4.446-452, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od13-stone]: (Odyssey 13.176-179)
[^met-flood]: "Neptune smites the Earth with his trident: she trembles and through her agitation lays open new channels for the waters" (Metamorphoses 1.283-284, trans. Brookes More)

## In the Aeneid

In [Virgil's account](../sources/aeneid.md), [Neptune](../deities/poseidon.md) calms the storm [Juno](../deities/hera.md) has raised against the Trojan fleet. The trident is the instrument of his authority over the sea, directly parallel to Jupiter's thunderbolt over the sky.

In the underworld, Poseidon "with his great trident shakes wall and foundation out of their places, and upturns all the city from her base" — part of the divine destruction of [Troy](../places/troy.md) revealed to [Aeneas](../heroes/aeneas.md) by [Venus](../deities/aphrodite.md).[^aen-trident]

[^aen-trident]: "Neptune with his great trident shakes wall and foundation out of their places, and upturns all the city from her base" (Aeneid 2.610-612, trans. J.W. Mackail)
