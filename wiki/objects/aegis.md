| **First appearance** | [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md) 11 (as Zeus's epithet) |

## Overview

The **aegis** is a divine object belonging to [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md), whose most common epithet throughout the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md) and [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) is "aegis-bearing" or "the aegis-holder." It was made by [Hephaestus](../deities/hephaestus.md) and given to Zeus "to bear for the terror of men."[^il15-origin] In the Iliad, it is also wielded by [Athena](../deities/athena.md) and [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md).

[^il15-origin]: "the fell aegis, dread, circled with a shaggy fringe, and gleaming, that Hephaistos the smith gave to Zeus, to bear for the terror of men" (Iliad XV.9009-9013, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

## Description

The aegis is described as "the holy aegis that knoweth neither age nor death, whereon wave an hundred tassels of pure gold, all deftly woven and each one an hundred oxen worth."[^il2-desc] It is "tasselled," "terrible," "dread, circled with a shaggy fringe, and gleaming."[^il15-desc]

When worn in battle, it bears emblems of war and terror: "all about which Terror is as a crown, and therein is Strife, therein Valour, therein the dread onset of Battle, therein the [Gorgon](../creatures/gorgons.md) head of the dread monster, terrible and grim, portent of aegis-bearing Zeus."[^il5-emblems]

It is impervious to the greatest forces: when [Ares](../deities/ares.md) attacks it, it is described as something "not even the lightning of Zeus can overcome."[^il21-ares]

[^il2-desc]: "the holy aegis that knoweth neither age nor death, whereon wave an hundred tassels of pure gold, all deftly woven and each one an hundred oxen worth" (Iliad II.1197-1202, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

[^il5-emblems]: "About her shoulders cast she the tasselled aegis terrible, all about which Terror is as a crown, and therein is Strife, therein Valour, therein the dread onset of Battle, therein the Gorgon head of the dread monster, terrible and grim, portent of aegis-bearing Zeus" (Iliad V.3185-3198, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

## Wielders

### Zeus

Zeus is the aegis's owner. His most common epithet across both the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md) and the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) is "aegis-bearing" or "the aegis-holder."[^zeus-epithet] The aegis was made for him by [Hephaestus](../deities/hephaestus.md), "to bear for the terror of men."[^il15-zeus]

[^zeus-epithet]: Zeus is called "aegis-bearing" / "the aegis-holder" throughout the Theogony and Iliad.
[^il15-zeus]: "the fell aegis, dread, circled with a shaggy fringe, and gleaming, that Hephaistos the smith gave to Zeus, to bear for the terror of men; with this in his hands did he lead the host" (Iliad XV.9009-9013, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

### Athena

Athena wields the aegis on multiple occasions in the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md). In her arming scene in Book V, "she put on the tunic of Zeus the cloud-gatherer, and arrayed her in her armour for dolorous battle. About her shoulders cast she the tasselled aegis terrible."[^il5-athena] In Book II, she bears it to rally the Greek army, passing "dazzling through the Achaian folk, urging them forth; and in every man's heart she roused strength to battle without ceasing and to fight."[^il2-athena] In Book XVIII, she casts it around Achilles to magnify his presence: "the bright-eyed goddess Athene cast about his mighty shoulders the tasselled aegis, and around his head the divine goddess set a crown of golden cloud, and kindled therefrom a blazing fire."[^il18-athena]

[^il5-athena]: "she put on the tunic of Zeus the cloud-gatherer, and arrayed her in her armour for dolorous battle. About her shoulders cast she the tasselled aegis terrible, all about which Terror is as a crown, and therein is Strife, therein Valour, therein the dread onset of Battle, therein the Gorgon head of the dread monster, terrible and grim, portent of aegis-bearing Zeus" (Iliad V.3185-3198, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il2-athena]: "bright-eyed Athene in the midst, bearing the holy aegis that knoweth neither age nor death, whereon wave an hundred tassels of pure gold, all deftly woven and each one an hundred oxen worth. Therewith she passed dazzling through the Achaian folk, urging them forth; and in every man's heart she roused strength to battle without ceasing and to fight" (Iliad II.1197-1202, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il18-athena]: "the bright-eyed goddess Athene cast about his mighty shoulders the tasselled aegis, and around his head the divine goddess set a crown of golden cloud, and kindled therefrom a blazing fire... Pallas Athene uttered her voice, and spread terror unspeakable among the men of Troy" (Iliad XVIII.10553-10562, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

### Apollo

[Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) wields the aegis in Book XV, leading the Trojan host: "in front of him went Phoebus Apollo, his shoulders wrapped in cloud, and still he held the fell aegis, dread, circled with a shaggy fringe, and gleaming... with this in his hands did he lead the host."[^il15-apollo] He also uses a "golden aegis" to protect Hector's body in Book XXIV.[^il24-apollo]

[^il15-apollo]: "in front of him went Phoebus Apollo, his shoulders wrapped in cloud, and still he held the fell aegis, dread, circled with a shaggy fringe, and gleaming, that Hephaistos the smith gave to Zeus, to bear for the terror of men; with this in his hands did he lead the host" (Iliad XV.9009-9013, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
