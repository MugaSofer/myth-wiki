## Overview

The **golden sandals** are divine footwear that grant their wearer flight over sea and land. The [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) describes them in a formulaic passage used for both [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md) and [Athena](../deities/athena.md): "lovely golden sandals that wax not old" that carry the wearer "alike over the wet sea and over the limitless land, swift as the breath of the wind."[^od-formula] The sandals appear to be part of the standard equipment of the gods rather than unique to any one deity, though they are most closely associated with Hermes.

## Description

The fullest description comes from the shared Homeric formula. In the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md), when [Athena](../deities/athena.md) departs for Ithaca: "She bound beneath her feet her lovely golden sandals that wax not old, and bare her alike over the wet sea and over the limitless land, swift as the breath of the wind."[^od1-athena]

The identical language is used when [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md) departs for Calypso's island: "Straightway he bound beneath his feet his lovely golden sandals, that wax not old, that bare him alike over the wet sea and over the limitless land, swift as the breath of the wind."[^od5-hermes]

In the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md), Hermes receives the same sandals when Zeus sends him to escort Priam: "Straightway beneath his feet he bound on his fair sandals, golden, divine, that bare him over wet sea and over the boundless land with the breathings of the wind."[^il24-hermes]

The key properties described are:
- **Golden** — consistently described as gold
- **Imperishable** — they "wax not old"
- **Flight** — carry the wearer over sea and land alike
- **Speed** — "swift as the breath of the wind"

## Bearers

### Hermes

The sandals are most strongly associated with [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md), who wears them on his major missions: escorting Priam to ransom Hector's body ([Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) XXIV) and travelling to Calypso's island to deliver Zeus's command ([Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) V). In both cases, he binds them on immediately before departure as part of his standard equipment alongside his wand.[^il24-hermes][^od5-hermes]

In the [Aeneid](../sources/aeneid.md), Mercury (Hermes) "laces to his feet the shoes of gold that bear him high winging over seas or land as fleet as the gale" before his embassy to Aeneas at Carthage.[^aen-mercury]

### Athena

[Athena](../deities/athena.md) wears the same sandals with the same formulaic description when she goes to Ithaca disguised as Mentes ([Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) I). She pairs them with "her doughty spear, shod with sharp bronze, weighty and huge and strong, wherewith she quells the ranks of heroes."[^od1-athena]

### Hera

[Hera](../deities/hera.md) is called "queenly Hera of Argos who walks on golden sandals" in the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md) and repeatedly referred to as "gold-shod Hera."[^theog-hera] In her seduction of Zeus in [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) XIV, she "beneath her shining feet bound goodly sandals" as part of her elaborate adornment.[^il14-hera]

### Perseus

In the [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md), [Perseus](../heroes/perseus.md) received winged sandals from certain nymphs (directed to them by the Phorcides): "these nymphs had winged sandals and the kibisis."[^apd-perseus] These enabled him to fly to the ocean to catch the Gorgons asleep. In the [Fabulae](../sources/hyginus.md), they are specifically identified as belonging to Hermes: Perseus rescued Andromeda "flying on Mercury's winged sandals."[^hyg-perseus]

On the [Shield of Heracles](../sources/shield-of-heracles.md), Perseus is depicted in flight: "On his feet he had winged sandals, and his black-sheathed sword was slung across his shoulders by a cross-belt of bronze. He was flying swift as thought."[^shield-perseus]

[^od-formula]: (Odyssey 1.99-101, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od1-athena]: "She bound beneath her feet her lovely golden sandals that wax not old, and bare her alike over the wet sea and over the limitless land, swift as the breath of the wind. And she seized her doughty spear, shod with sharp bronze, weighty and huge and strong, wherewith she quells the ranks of heroes with whomsoever she is wroth, the daughter of the mighty sire." (Odyssey 1.99-104, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od5-hermes]: "Straightway he bound beneath his feet his lovely golden sandals, that wax not old, that bare him alike over the wet sea and over the limitless land, swift as the breath of the wind. And he took the wand wherewith he lulls the eyes of whomso he will, while others again he even wakes from out of sleep." (Odyssey 5.53-57, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^il24-hermes]: "Straightway beneath his feet he bound on his fair sandals, golden, divine, that bare him over wet sea and over the boundless land with the breathings of the wind. And he took up his wand wherewith he entranceth the eyes of such men as he will, and others he likewise waketh out of sleep." (Iliad 24.289-292, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^aen-mercury]: "he laces to his feet the shoes of gold that bear him high winging over seas or land as fleet as the gale; then takes the rod wherewith he calls wan souls forth of Orcus" (Aeneid 4.239-244, trans. J.W. Mackail)
[^theog-hera]: "queenly Hera of Argos who walks on golden sandals" (Theogony 11-12, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White); "gold-shod Hera" (Theogony 454)
[^il14-hera]: "beneath her shining feet she bound goodly sandals" (Iliad 14.188-189, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^apd-perseus]: "these nymphs had winged sandals and the kibisis, which they say was a wallet" (Bibliotheca 2.4.2, trans. Frazer)
[^hyg-perseus]: "Perseus, flying on Mercury's winged sandals, is said to have come there and freed her from danger" (Fabulae §64, trans. Mary Grant)
[^shield-perseus]: "On his feet he had winged sandals, and his black-sheathed sword was slung across his shoulders by a cross-belt of bronze. He was flying swift as thought." (Shield of Heracles 220-222, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
