# Helm of Hades

| | |
|---|---|
| **Also known as** | Cap of Hades |
| **Owner** | [Hades](../deities/hades.md) |
| **Also used by** | [Athena](../deities/athena.md), Perseus |
| **First appearance** | [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) V |

## Overview

The **helm of Hades** is a cap or helmet that renders its wearer invisible. It belongs to [Hades](../deities/hades.md), though in our sources it is used by [Athena](../deities/athena.md) rather than by Hades himself.

## Description

The helm's only firmly attested appearance in our processed sources is in [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book V. During [Athena](../deities/athena.md)'s arming scene, after donning the aegis and her golden helm, "she put on the helm of Hades, that terrible [Ares](../deities/ares.md) might not behold her."[^il5-helm] This allowed her to intervene unseen in the battle between Diomedes and Ares.

No physical description of the helm is given beyond its power of concealment.

### Perseus on the Shield (Shield of Heracles)

In the [Shield of Heracles](../sources/shield-of-heracles.md), Perseus is depicted wearing the helm as he flees the Gorgons: "Upon the head of the hero lay the dread cap of Hades which had the awful gloom of night."[^sh-cap] Here it is called "the dread cap" rather than helm, but its identity is confirmed by context — it belongs to [Hades](../deities/hades.md) and grants concealment.

[^il5-helm]: "she put on the helm of Hades, that terrible Ares might not behold her" (Iliad V.3205-3206, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^sh-cap]: "Upon the head of the hero lay the dread cap of Hades which had the awful gloom of night" (Shield of Heracles 226-227, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
