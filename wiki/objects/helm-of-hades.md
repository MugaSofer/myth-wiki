## Overview

The **helm of Hades** is a cap or helmet that renders its wearer invisible. It belongs to [Hades](../deities/hades.md), though in our sources it is used by [Athena](../deities/athena.md) rather than by Hades himself.

## Description

The helm's only firmly attested appearance in our processed sources is in [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book V. During [Athena](../deities/athena.md)'s arming scene, after donning the aegis and her golden helm, "she put on the helm of Hades, that terrible [Ares](../deities/ares.md) might not behold her."[^il5-helm] This allowed her to intervene unseen in the battle between Diomedes and Ares.

No physical description of the helm is given beyond its power of concealment.

[^il5-helm]: "she put on the helm of Hades, that terrible Ares might not behold her" (Iliad V.3205-3206, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

## Appearances

- **[Iliad](../sources/iliad.md)** V.3205-3206: Worn by [Athena](../deities/athena.md) to hide from [Ares](../deities/ares.md)
