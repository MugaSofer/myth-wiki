## Overview

The **helm of Hades** is a cap or helmet that renders its wearer invisible. Forged by the [Cyclopes](../creatures/cyclopes.md) alongside [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md)'s thunderbolt and [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md)'s trident, it belongs to [Hades](../deities/hades.md), though in the surviving sources it is always used by others — [Athena](../deities/athena.md), [Perseus](../heroes/perseus.md), and [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md) — rather than by Hades himself.

## Origin

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) records the helm's creation: the Cyclopes, freed by Zeus from [Tartarus](../places/tartarus.md), "gave Zeus thunder and lightning and a thunderbolt, and on Pluto they bestowed a helmet, and on Poseidon a trident."[^apd-forging] These were the weapons that enabled the three brothers to overthrow the [Titans](../deities/groups/titans.md).

[^apd-forging]: "they gave Zeus thunder and lightning and a thunderbolt, and on Pluto they bestowed a helmet, and on Poseidon a trident" (Bibliotheca 1.2.1, trans. Frazer)

## In the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md)

### Athena's Invisibility (Book V)

During [Athena](../deities/athena.md)'s arming scene, after donning the [aegis](aegis.md) and her golden helm, "she put on the helm of Hades, that terrible [Ares](../deities/ares.md) might not behold her."[^il5-helm] This allowed her to intervene unseen in the battle, guiding Diomedes' spear into Ares' flank.

No physical description of the helm is given beyond its power of concealment.

[^il5-helm]: "she put on the helm of Hades, that terrible Ares might not behold her" (Iliad 5.651-652, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

## In the [Shield of Heracles](../sources/shield-of-heracles.md)

### Perseus and the Gorgons (Lines 220-227)

On the shield, [Perseus](../heroes/perseus.md) is depicted wearing the helm as he flees the [Gorgons](../creatures/gorgons.md): "Upon the head of the hero lay the dread cap of Hades which had the awful gloom of night."[^sh-cap] Here it is called "the dread cap" rather than helm, and the only physical detail is its association with darkness — "the awful gloom of night."

## In the [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md)

### Hermes in the Gigantomachy (1.6.2)

[Hermes](../deities/hermes.md) borrowed the helm during the battle against the [Giants](../creatures/giants.md): "Hermes, wearing the helmet of Hades, slew Hippolytus in the fight."[^apd-helm-hermes] The helm's invisibility made it a weapon of stealth, allowing Hermes to strike unseen.

[^apd-helm-hermes]: "Hermes, wearing the helmet of Hades, slew Hippolytus in the fight" (Bibliotheca 1.6.2, trans. Frazer)

### Perseus and the Gorgon Quest (2.4.2-2.4.3)

The cap played a central role in [Perseus](../heroes/perseus.md)'s quest for [Medusa](../creatures/gorgons.md)'s head. Certain nymphs possessed "the cap of Hades" along with [winged sandals](golden-sandals.md) and the kibisis (wallet). Perseus obtained all three by extorting directions from the Phorcides.[^apd-helm-perseus]

Its power is described precisely: "he put the cap on his head. Wearing it, he saw whom he pleased, but was not seen by others."[^apd-helm-perseus] After beheading Medusa, the surviving Gorgons pursued him but "could not see him on account of the cap, for he was hidden by it."[^apd-helm-escape]
