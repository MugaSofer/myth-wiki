## Overview

The **thunderbolt** is the supreme weapon of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md), fashioned by the [Cyclopes](../creatures/cyclopes.md). It is the instrument through which Zeus enforces his rule over gods and mortals alike.

## Description

The thunderbolt was made by the three [Cyclopes](../creatures/cyclopes.md) — Brontes, Steropes, and Arges — "who gave Zeus the thunder and made the thunderbolt."[^theog-141] These had been hidden away by [Gaia](../deities/gaia.md) until Zeus freed the Cyclopes from bondage: "These gave him thunder and the glowing thunderbolt and lightening: for before that, huge Earth had hidden these."[^theog-501]

Zeus wields the thunderbolt as the sign of his kingship: "he was reigning in heaven, himself holding the lightning and glowing thunderbolt, when he had overcome by might his father [Cronos](../deities/cronos.md)."[^theog-71]

## Role

### Instrument of Supremacy

The thunderbolt underpins Zeus's absolute power. In the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md), he challenges all the other gods with the golden chain speech, declaring "By so much am I beyond gods and beyond men."[^il8-chain] His supremacy rests ultimately on the weapon none can match.

### Defeating Typhoeus

Zeus used the thunderbolt to overcome [Typhoeus](../creatures/typhoeus.md), the last challenger to his rule: "he leaped from [Olympus](../places/olympus.md) and struck him."[^theog-854]

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) gives an expanded account of the thunderbolt's role: "[Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) pelted Typhon at a distance with thunderbolts, and at close quarters struck him down with an adamantine sickle." After recovering his sinews, "Zeus suddenly from heaven, riding in a chariot of winged horses, pelted Typhon with thunderbolts and pursued him" through Nysa and Thrace. Finally, "when he started to flee through the Sicilian sea, Zeus cast Mount Etna in Sicily upon him."[^apd-bolt-typhon]

> **NOTE:** The Bibliotheca's account is far more detailed than the Theogony's. The thunderbolts are used at range while the adamantine sickle serves for close combat — and the thunderbolts alone prove insufficient, as Typhon temporarily defeats Zeus and severs his sinews.

[^apd-bolt-typhon]: "Zeus pelted Typhon at a distance with thunderbolts, and at close quarters struck him down with an adamantine sickle... Zeus suddenly from heaven, riding in a chariot of winged horses, pelted Typhon with thunderbolts" (Bibliotheca 1.6.3, trans. Frazer)

### Battlefield Interventions

In the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md), Zeus employs the thunderbolt repeatedly to shape the course of the Trojan War. He hurls lightning before Diomedes' horses to drive the Greeks back (Book VIII), and breaks Teukros's bowstring with a thunderbolt (Book XV). When [Hera](../deities/hera.md) and [Athena](../deities/athena.md) attempt to intervene in battle, he threatens them through [Iris](../deities/iris.md) with devastating force.[^il8-threats]

### Threat to Mortals

[Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md) warns her mortal lover Anchises never to reveal their union: "Zeus will smite you in his anger with a smoking thunderbolt."[^hh5-warning]

[^theog-141]: "who gave Zeus the thunder and made the thunderbolt" (Theogony 141, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^theog-501]: "they remembered to be grateful to him for his kindness, and gave him thunder and the glowing thunderbolt and lightening: for before that, huge Earth had hidden these. In them he trusts and rules over mortals and immortals" (Theogony 501-506, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^theog-71]: "he was reigning in heaven, himself holding the lightning and glowing thunderbolt, when he had overcome by might his father Cronos" (Theogony 71-74, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^il8-chain]: "Fasten ye a rope of gold from heaven, and all ye gods lay hold thereof and all goddesses; yet could ye not drag from heaven to earth Zeus, counsellor supreme, not though ye toiled sore. But once I likewise were minded to draw with all my heart, then should I draw you up with very earth and sea withal. Thereafter would I bind the rope about a pinnacle of Olympus, and so should all those things be hung in air. By so much am I beyond gods and beyond men." (Iliad 8.23-29, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^theog-854]: "So when Zeus had raised up his might and seized his arms, thunder and lightning and lurid thunderbolt, he leaped from Olympus and struck him" (Theogony 854-858, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^il8-threats]: "I will maim their fleet horses in the chariot, and them will I hurl out from the car, and will break in pieces the chariot; neither within the courses of ten years shall they heal them of the wounds the thunderbolt shall tear" (Iliad 8.406-412, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^hh5-warning]: "Zeus will smite you in his anger with a smoking thunderbolt" (Homeric Hymn V to Aphrodite 286-290, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
