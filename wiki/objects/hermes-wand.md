## Overview

The golden wand is [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md)'s signature instrument, capable of inducing and breaking sleep. It was given to him by [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) as part of their exchange of gifts.

## Origin

When Hermes and Apollo reconciled after the cattle theft, Apollo gave Hermes "a splendid wand of riches and wealth, golden, with three branches."[^hh4-wand]

[^hh4-wand]: "then Phoebus gave the son of Maia a splendid wand of riches and wealth, golden, with three branches" (Homeric Hymn IV to Hermes 529-530, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Description

In the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md), the wand is described in full when [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) sends Hermes to guide Priam to Achilles: "he took up his wand wherewith he entranceth the eyes of such men as he will, and others he likewise waketh out of sleep."[^il24-wand]

[^il24-wand]: "And he took up his wand wherewith he entranceth the eyes of such men as he will, and others he likewise waketh out of sleep" (Iliad XXIV.14067-14069, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

## Powers

The wand has a dual power over sleep and waking. Hermes uses it to put the Greek sentinels to sleep so that Priam can pass safely through the camp to Achilles' hut.[^il24-sleep]
