## Overview

The **Wooden Horse** is the stratagem by which the Greeks finally captured [Troy](../places/troy.md) after ten years of siege. Devised by [Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md) and built by Epeus, it was a hollow wooden construction that concealed Greek warriors inside, presented to the Trojans as an offering to [Athena](../deities/athena.md).

## In the Odyssey

In [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) Book VIII, Demodocus sings the tale of the Wooden Horse at [Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md)'s request — "how Epeus with the aid of [Athena](../deities/athena.md) made the horse, the which goodly Odysseus led up to the acropolis, filled with the men who wasted Ilios."

## In the Bibliotheca (E.5.14-21)

### Construction

[Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md) "invented the construction of the Wooden Horse and suggested it to Epeus, who was an architect. Epeus felled timber on Ida, and constructed the horse with a hollow interior and an opening in the sides."[^apd-build]

"Into this horse Ulysses persuaded fifty (or, according to the author of the Little Iliad, three thousand) of the doughtiest to enter."[^apd-enter]

### The Inscription

An inscription was engraved on the horse: "For their return home, the Greeks dedicate this thank-offering to [Athena](../deities/athena.md)."[^apd-inscription]

### The Trojans Debate

"At break of day, when the Trojans beheld the camp of the Greeks deserted and believed that they had fled, they with great joy dragged the horse, and stationing it beside the palace of [Priam](../heroes/priam.md) deliberated what they should do." Cassandra warned "that there was an armed force in it," and Laocoon the seer confirmed her warning, but "most were in favour of sparing it as a votive offering sacred to a divinity."[^apd-debate]

[Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) sent a sign confirming the danger: "two serpents swam through the sea from the neighboring islands and devoured the sons of Laocoon."[^apd-serpents]

### Helen's Test

At night, [Helen](../heroes/helen.md) "going round the horse, called the chiefs, imitating the voices of each of their wives. But when Anticlus would have answered, Ulysses held fast his mouth."[^apd-helen]

### The Sack

"When they thought that their foes were asleep, they opened the horse and came forth with their arms. The first, Echion, son of Portheus, was killed by leaping from it; but the rest let themselves down by a rope."[^apd-sack]

[^apd-debate]: "Cassandra said that there was an armed force in it, and she was further confirmed by Laocoon, the seer, some were for burning it, and others for throwing it down a precipice; but as most were in favour of sparing it as a votive offering sacred to a divinity, they betook them to sacrifice and feasting" (Bibliotheca E.5.17, trans. J.G. Frazer)

The first, Echion, son of Portheus, was killed by leaping from it; but the rest let themselves down by a rope, and lighted on the walls, and having opened the gates they admitted their comrades" (Bibliotheca E.5.20, trans. J.G. Frazer)

## In the [Posthomerica](../sources/posthomerica.md)

### The Plan (Book XII)

[Calchas](../heroes/calchas.md) told the assembled Greek chiefs to abandon the siege in favour of a stratagem, interpreting an omen of a falcon catching a dove by ambush. [Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md) proposed the plan: "A great Horse let us fashion, in the which our mightiest shall take ambush. Let the host burn all their tents, and sail from hence away to Tenedos." He specified that "some brave man, unknown of any in [Troy](../places/troy.md), with a stout heart" should remain beside the Horse and claim it was an offering to [Athena](../deities/athena.md).[^post-plan]

[Neoptolemus](../heroes/neoptolemus.md) and [Philoctetes](../heroes/philoctetes.md) objected, preferring direct assault: "Brave men meet face to face their foes! Who skulk behind their walls, and fight from towers, are nidderings." Odysseus countered that even Achilles' might "availed not to smite Priam's wealthy burg." When both still refused the stratagem, [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) himself hurled a thunderbolt before them, and "unto fear straightway turned were their bold hearts."[^post-objection]

### Construction (Book XII)

[Athena](../deities/athena.md) appeared to Epeius in a dream, "clothed in shape of a maiden tender-fleshed," and bade him build the Horse, promising to labour at his side. Timber was felled on Ida. Epeius "fashioned the feet of that great Horse of Wood: the belly next he shaped, and over this moulded the back and the great loins behind, the throat in front, and ridged the towering neck with waving mane: the crested head he wrought, the streaming tail, the ears, the lucent eyes — all that of lifelike horses have." It was completed in three days. The host "marvelled how the wood expressed mettle, and speed of foot — yea, seemed to neigh."[^post-build]

### The Warriors Inside (Book XII)

The poem names each warrior who entered: [Neoptolemus](../heroes/neoptolemus.md) first, then [Menelaus](../heroes/menelaus.md), [Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md), Sthenelus, [Diomedes](../heroes/diomedes.md), [Philoctetes](../heroes/philoctetes.md), Menestheus, Anticlus, Thoas, Polypoetes, [Ajax](../heroes/ajax.md) (the Locrian), Eurypylus, Thrasymede, Idomeneus, Meriones, Podaleirius, Teucer, and many more — "yea, all their chiefest, so many as that carven Horse could hold." Epeius entered last: "in his breast lay the secret of the opening of its doors... he drew the ladders up, then made he all secure." They sat "in silence 'twixt victory and death."[^post-warriors]

### The Deception and Entry into Troy (Book XII)

[Sinon](../heroes/sinon.md) maintained his cover story under torture. [Laocoon](../heroes/laocoon.md) urged burning the Horse but was struck blind by Athena, and his sons were devoured by serpents. The Trojans then "o'er that huge Horse hastily cast a rope" over wooden rollers Epeius had laid beneath its feet, and "with multitudinous tug and strain" dragged it into the city. "With great festoons of flowers they hung it, and their own heads did they wreathe, while answering each other pealed the flutes." They broke down their own walls to admit it.[^post-entry]

[^post-plan]: "A great Horse let us fashion, in the which our mightiest shall take ambush. Let the host burn all their tents, and sail from hence away to Tenedos" (Posthomerica 12.8745-8748, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post-objection]: "Brave men meet face to face their foes! Who skulk behind their walls, and fight from towers, are nidderings" (Posthomerica 12.8788-8790); "he shook the earth beneath their feet, and all the air shuddered, as down before those heroes twain he hurled his thunderbolt" (12.8817-8820)
[^post-build]: "Fashioned the feet of that great Horse of Wood: the belly next he shaped, and over this moulded the back and the great loins behind, the throat in front, and ridged the towering neck with waving mane: the crested head he wrought, the streaming tail, the ears, the lucent eyes — all that of lifelike horses have... marvelling how the wood expressed mettle, and speed of foot — yea, seemed to neigh" (Posthomerica 12.8868-8880)
[^post-warriors]: "Into that cavernous Horse Achilles' son first entered, strong Menelaus followed then, Odysseus, Sthenelus, godlike Diomede, Philoctetes and Menestheus, Anticlus, Thoas and Polypoetes golden-haired..." (Posthomerica 12.9070-9092)
[^post-entry]: "o'er that huge Horse hastily cast a rope, and made it fast above; for under its feet smooth wooden rollers had Epeius laid... with great festoons of flowers they hung it... they brake they down the walls, their city's coronal, that the Horse of Death might be led in" (Posthomerica 12.9194-9213)
