## Overview

The **Wooden Horse** is the stratagem by which the Greeks finally captured [Troy](../places/troy.md) after ten years of siege. Devised by [Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md) and built by Epeus, it was a hollow wooden construction that concealed Greek warriors inside, presented to the Trojans as an offering to [Athena](../deities/athena.md).

## In the Odyssey

In [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) Book VIII, Demodocus sings the tale of the Wooden Horse at [Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md)'s request — "how Epeus with the aid of [Athena](../deities/athena.md) made the horse, the which goodly Odysseus led up to the acropolis, filled with the men who wasted Ilios."

## In the Bibliotheca (E.5.14-21)

### Construction

[Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md) "invented the construction of the Wooden Horse and suggested it to Epeus, who was an architect. Epeus felled timber on Ida, and constructed the horse with a hollow interior and an opening in the sides."[^apd-build]

"Into this horse Ulysses persuaded fifty (or, according to the author of the Little Iliad, three thousand) of the doughtiest to enter."[^apd-enter]

### The Inscription

An inscription was engraved on the horse: "For their return home, the Greeks dedicate this thank-offering to [Athena](../deities/athena.md)."[^apd-inscription]

### The Trojans Debate

"At break of day, when the Trojans beheld the camp of the Greeks deserted and believed that they had fled, they with great joy dragged the horse, and stationing it beside the palace of [Priam](../heroes/priam.md) deliberated what they should do." Cassandra warned "that there was an armed force in it," and Laocoon the seer confirmed her warning, but "most were in favour of sparing it as a votive offering sacred to a divinity."[^apd-debate]

[Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) sent a sign confirming the danger: "two serpents swam through the sea from the neighboring islands and devoured the sons of Laocoon."[^apd-serpents]

### Helen's Test

At night, [Helen](../heroes/helen.md) "going round the horse, called the chiefs, imitating the voices of each of their wives. But when Anticlus would have answered, Ulysses held fast his mouth."[^apd-helen]

### The Sack

"When they thought that their foes were asleep, they opened the horse and came forth with their arms. The first, Echion, son of Portheus, was killed by leaping from it; but the rest let themselves down by a rope."[^apd-sack]
