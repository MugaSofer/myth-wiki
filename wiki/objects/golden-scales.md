## Overview

The **golden scales** are the instrument with which [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) weighs the fates of mortals. They appear twice in the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md), each time at a decisive turning point in battle.

## Description

The scales are made of gold, held by their centre, and loaded with "fates of death" — one for each side in the conflict. The side whose fate sinks down is doomed.

### Weighing the Armies (Book VIII)

At midday during the general battle, Zeus uses the scales to determine the outcome between Greeks and Trojans: "when the sun bestrode mid-heaven, then did the Father balance his golden scales, and put therein two fates of death that layeth men at their length, one for horse-taming Trojans, one for mail-clad Achaians; and he took the scale-yard by the midst and lifted it, and the Achaians' day of destiny sank down."[^il8-scales]

### Weighing Achilles and [Hector](../heroes/hector.md) (Book XXII)

Before the final duel, Zeus weighs the fates of the two champions individually: "then the Father hung his golden balances, and set therein two lots of dreary death, one of Achilles, one of horse-taming Hector, and held them by the midst and poised. Then Hector's fated day sank down, and fell to the house of [Hades](../deities/hades.md), and Phoebus [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) left him."[^il22-scales]

The second weighing is especially significant: the moment Hector's lot sinks, Apollo — who had been protecting him — abandons him to his fate. The scales thus mark the point at which even divine favour yields to destiny.

Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
