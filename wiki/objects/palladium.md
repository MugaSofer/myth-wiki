## Overview

The **Palladium** is a wooden image of [Athena](../deities/athena.md) that fell from heaven and was kept in [Troy](../places/troy.md). It served as a divine talisman protecting the city — "while it was within the walls the city could not be taken."

## In the Bibliotheca

### Origin (3.12.3)

When Ilus founded Ilium, he "prayed to [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) that a sign might be shown to him, he beheld by day the Palladium, fallen from heaven, lying before his tent. It was three cubits in height, its feet joined together; in its right hand it held a spear aloft, and in the other hand a distaff and spindle."[^apd-fall]

### The Story of Pallas (3.12.3)

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) tells the origin of the image: "When [Athena](../deities/athena.md) was born she was brought up by Triton, who had a daughter Pallas; and both girls practised the arts of war, but once on a time they fell out; and when Pallas was about to strike a blow, Zeus in fear interposed the [aegis](aegis.md), and Pallas, being startled, looked up, and so fell wounded by Athena."[^apd-pallas]

"And being exceedingly grieved for her, Athena made a wooden image in her likeness, and wrapped the aegis, which she had feared, about the breast of it, and set it up beside Zeus and honored it."[^apd-image]

Later, "Electra, at the time of her violation, took refuge at the image, and Zeus threw the Palladium along with Ate into the Ilian country; and Ilus built a temple for it."[^apd-thrown]

### Theft by Odysseus and Diomedes (E.5.10, E.5.13)

When Helenus revealed Troy's oracles, one condition for the city's fall was "if the Palladium, which had fallen from heaven, were stolen from Troy, for while it was within the walls the city could not be taken."[^apd-oracle]

"[Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md) went with Diomedes by night to the city... and after disfiguring himself and putting on mean attire he entered unknown into the city as a beggar. And being recognized by [Helen](../heroes/helen.md), he with her help stole away the Palladium, and after killing many of the guards, brought it to the ships with the aid of Diomedes."[^apd-theft]
