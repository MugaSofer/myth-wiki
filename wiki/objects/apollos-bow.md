## Overview

The silver bow is [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md)'s defining weapon, so closely associated with him that "far-shooting" and "of the silver bow" serve as his most common epithets.

## Description

Apollo's bow brings plague and death. In the opening of the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md), when his priest Chryses is dishonoured, Apollo descends from [Olympus](../places/olympus.md) "wroth at heart, bearing on his shoulders his bow and covered quiver. And the arrows clanged upon his shoulders in his wrath, as the god moved; and he came like the night." For nine days "the pyres of the dead burnt continually in multitude."[^il1-plague]

The bow also brings gentler death. In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) XXIV, Hekabe wishes that Achilles were dead, "like one on whom far-darting [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md), lord of the silver bow, hath descended and slain him with his gentle darts."[^il24-gentle]

In the story of Niobe, "Apollo slew the sons with arrows from his silver bow, being angered with Niobe," while [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md) slew the daughters.[^il24-niobe]

[^il1-plague]: "wroth at heart, bearing on his shoulders his bow and covered quiver. And the arrows clanged upon his shoulders in his wrath, as the god moved; and he came like the night... the pyres of the dead burnt continually in multitude" (Iliad I.210-220, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il24-gentle]: "like one on whom Apollo, lord of the silver bow, hath descended and slain him with his gentle darts" (Iliad XXIV.14227-14228)
[^il24-niobe]: "Apollo slew the sons with arrows from his silver bow, being angered with Niobe, and shaft-showering Artemis slew the daughters" (Iliad XXIV.14189-14191)

## At His Birth

In the [Homeric Hymn to Apollo](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) (III), the newborn Apollo immediately declares his domains: "The lyre and the curved bow shall ever be dear to me, and I will declare to men the unfailing will of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md)." He then "stepped out to walk upon the wide-pathed earth, far-shooting Apollo."[^hh3-birth]

[^hh3-birth]: "The lyre and the curved bow shall ever be dear to me, and I will declare to men the unfailing will of Zeus... Then Phoebus Apollo stepped out to walk upon the wide-pathed earth, far-shooting Apollo" (Homeric Hymn III to Apollo 131-133, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Slaying the Dragon

Apollo uses the bow to slay the she-dragon at Pytho: "the lord Phoebus Apollo boasted over her: 'Now rot here upon the soil that feeds man! You at least shall live no more to be a fell bane to men.' ... Then Phoebus Apollo saw that the sweet-flowing spring had beguiled him, and he rushed upon Telphusa in anger, and soon stopping her spring, he hurled a crag on it."[^hh3-dragon]

[^hh3-dragon]: "the lord Phoebus Apollo boasted over her: 'Now rot here upon the soil that feeds man! You at least shall live no more to be a fell bane to men'" (Homeric Hymn III to Apollo 363-369, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
