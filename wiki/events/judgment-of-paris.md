## Overview

The **Judgment of Paris** is the divine beauty contest that sets in motion the Trojan War. When Strife (Eris) casts an apple among three goddesses, [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) delegates the decision to the Trojan prince Paris, who awards the prize to [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md) in exchange for the most beautiful woman in the world.

## In the Epic Cycle (Cypria)

The [Cypria](../sources/epic-cycle.md) gives the fullest early version. [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) plans the Trojan War to depopulate the earth. At the wedding of [Peleus](../heroes/peleus.md) and [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md), Strife casts an apple as a prize of beauty to be contended for by [Hera](../deities/hera.md), [Athena](../deities/athena.md), and [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md). Zeus sends them to Paris on Mount Ida.

## In the Iliad

The [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) makes only one explicit reference to the Judgment, late in Book XXIV, when the gods debate whether to let [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md) steal Hector's body. [Hera](../deities/hera.md) objects because of Paris's original insult — he had chosen [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md), who "furthered his fatal lustfulness."

## In the Bibliotheca (E.3.1-2)

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) gives the most systematic account:

"For one of these reasons Strife threw an apple as a prize of beauty to be contended for by [Hera](../deities/hera.md), [Athena](../deities/athena.md), and [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md); and [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) commanded [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md) to lead them to Alexander on Ida in order to be judged by him."[^apd-apple]

"And they promised to give Alexander gifts. Hera said that if she were preferred to all women, she would give him the kingdom over all men; and Athena promised victory in war, and Aphrodite the hand of [Helen](../heroes/helen.md). And he decided in favour of Aphrodite."[^apd-gifts]

Paris then "sailed away to Sparta with ships built by Phereclus."[^apd-sailed]

## In the Catalogue of Women

The Catalogue preserves a version of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md)'s plan that is more theologically explicit than the Cypria's. After [Helen](../heroes/helen.md) bore Hermione, "all the gods were divided through strife; for at that very time Zeus who thunders on high was meditating marvellous deeds, even to mingle storm and tempest over the boundless earth, and already he was hastening to make an utter end of the race of mortal men, declaring that he would destroy the lives of the demi-gods, that the children of the gods should not mate with wretched mortals, seeing their fate with their own eyes; but that the blessed gods henceforth even as aforetime should have their living and their habitations apart from men."[^cat-zeus-plan]

This presents Zeus's motivation differently from the Cypria: it is not merely the earth's overpopulation but a desire to separate the divine and human worlds entirely. The war will destroy the demi-gods — the generation of heroes — so that gods and mortals are no longer entangled.

[^apd-apple]: "Strife threw an apple as a prize of beauty to be contended for by Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite; and Zeus commanded Hermes to lead them to Alexander on Ida in order to be judged by him" (Bibliotheca E.3.2, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-gifts]: "they promised to give Alexander gifts. Hera said that if she were preferred to all women, she would give him the kingdom over all men; and Athena promised victory in war, and Aphrodite the hand of Helen. And he decided in favour of Aphrodite" (Bibliotheca E.3.2, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-sailed]: "he sailed away to Sparta with ships built by Phereclus" (Bibliotheca E.3.2, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^cat-zeus-plan]: "all the gods were divided through strife; for at that very time Zeus who thunders on high was meditating marvellous deeds, even to mingle storm and tempest over the boundless earth, and already he was hastening to make an utter end of the race of mortal men, declaring that he would destroy the lives of the demi-gods, that the children of the gods should not mate with wretched mortals... but that the blessed gods henceforth even as aforetime should have their living and their habitations apart from men" (Catalogue of Women, Fragment 68, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
