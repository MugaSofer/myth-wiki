## Overview

The **Judgment of Paris** is the divine beauty contest that sets in motion the Trojan War. When Strife (Eris) casts an apple among three goddesses, [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) delegates the decision to the Trojan prince Paris, who awards the prize to [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md) in exchange for the most beautiful woman in the world.

## In the Epic Cycle (Cypria)

The [Cypria](../sources/epic-cycle.md) gives the fullest early version. [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) plans the Trojan War to depopulate the earth. At the wedding of [Peleus](../heroes/peleus.md) and [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md), Strife casts an apple as a prize of beauty to be contended for by [Hera](../deities/hera.md), [Athena](../deities/athena.md), and [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md). Zeus sends them to Paris on Mount Ida.

## In the Iliad

The [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) makes only one explicit reference to the Judgment, late in Book XXIV, when the gods debate whether to let [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md) steal Hector's body. [Hera](../deities/hera.md) objects because of Paris's original insult — he had chosen [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md), who "furthered his fatal lustfulness."

## In the Bibliotheca (E.3.1-2)

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) gives the most systematic account:

"For one of these reasons Strife threw an apple as a prize of beauty to be contended for by [Hera](../deities/hera.md), [Athena](../deities/athena.md), and [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md); and [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) commanded [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md) to lead them to Alexander on Ida in order to be judged by him."[^apd-apple]

"And they promised to give Alexander gifts. Hera said that if she were preferred to all women, she would give him the kingdom over all men; and Athena promised victory in war, and Aphrodite the hand of [Helen](../heroes/helen.md). And he decided in favour of Aphrodite."[^apd-gifts]

Paris then "sailed away to Sparta with ships built by Phereclus."[^apd-sailed]

[^apd-apple]: "Strife threw an apple as a prize of beauty to be contended for by Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite; and Zeus commanded Hermes to lead them to Alexander on Ida in order to be judged by him" (Bibliotheca E.3.2, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-gifts]: "they promised to give Alexander gifts. Hera said that if she were preferred to all women, she would give him the kingdom over all men; and Athena promised victory in war, and Aphrodite the hand of Helen. And he decided in favour of Aphrodite" (Bibliotheca E.3.2, trans. J.G. Frazer)
