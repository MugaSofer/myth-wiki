## Overview

The **Trojan War** was the central conflict of Greek mythology, a ten-year siege of [Troy](../places/troy.md) by a coalition of Greek kingdoms. The war was caused by [Paris](../heroes/paris.md)'s abduction of [Helen](../heroes/helen.md) from [Menelaus](../heroes/menelaus.md), though the sources attribute deeper causes to [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md)'s plan to reduce the human population.

No single ancient source tells the complete story. The [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) covers only a few weeks in the tenth year. The [Posthomerica](../sources/posthomerica.md) picks up where the Iliad leaves off, covering events from the death of [Penthesilea](../heroes/penthesilea.md) through the fall of Troy and its aftermath. The full narrative must be pieced together from the [Epic Cycle](../sources/epic-cycle.md) (surviving in fragments and summaries), the [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md), and other sources.

## Causes

### Zeus's Plan

The [Epic Cycle](../sources/epic-cycle.md) (Cypria) attributes the war to a deliberate design by [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) and [Themis](../deities/themis.md): "Zeus saw it and had pity and in his wise heart resolved to relieve the all-nurturing earth of men by causing the great struggle of the Ilian war, that the load of death might empty the world."[^cyp-zeus]

[Euripides' Orestes](../sources/euripides-orestes.md) echoes this: Zeus designed the war "that they might draw from off the earth the pride of mortals, who had become an infinite multitude."[^eur-or-zeus]

[^cyp-zeus]: "Zeus saw it and had pity and in his wise heart resolved to relieve the all-nurturing earth of men by causing the great struggle of the Ilian war, that the load of death might empty the world" (Cypria, Fragment 3, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^eur-or-zeus]: Euripides, Orestes ~1639-1642, trans. T.A. Buckley

### The Judgment of Paris

See main article: [Judgment of Paris](judgment-of-paris.md).

Strife threw a golden apple among the goddesses at the wedding of [Peleus](../heroes/peleus.md) and [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md). [Hera](../deities/hera.md), [Athena](../deities/athena.md), and [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md) each claimed it. [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) sent [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md) to [Paris](../heroes/paris.md) on Mount Ida to judge. Paris chose Aphrodite, who promised him [Helen](../heroes/helen.md).[^apd-judgment]

[^apd-judgment]: Bibliotheca E.3.2, trans. J.G. Frazer

### The Oath of Tyndareus

[Tyndareus](../heroes/tyndareus.md), at [Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md)'s suggestion, made Helen's suitors swear to defend her chosen husband against any wrong. This oath bound the Greek kings to join the expedition when Paris abducted Helen.[^apd-oath]

[^apd-oath]: Bibliotheca 3.10.9, trans. J.G. Frazer

## Sequence of Events

### Muster and Aulis

The Greeks assembled a fleet of over a thousand ships at Aulis. [Calchas](../heroes/calchas.md) interpreted the serpent omen to mean Troy would fall in ten years.[^apd-serpent] The fleet was becalmed by [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md), who demanded the sacrifice of [Iphigenia](../heroes/iphigenia.md); she was saved by the goddess at the last moment and transported to the Taurians.[^apd-aulis]

[^apd-aulis]: Bibliotheca E.3.21-22

### The War (Years 1-9)

The first nine years of fighting are summarized briefly in the sources. The Greeks ravaged the Troad and surrounding regions. [Achilles](../heroes/achilles.md) sacked numerous cities.

### The Iliad (Year 10)

See main article: [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md).

The [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) narrates events during a few weeks in the tenth year, centered on the wrath of [Achilles](../heroes/achilles.md) after [Agamemnon](../heroes/agamemnon.md) takes his war-prize Briseis. The poem covers Achilles' withdrawal, the Greek defeats, the death of Patroclus, Achilles' return, his killing of [Hector](../heroes/hector.md), and the ransom of Hector's body.

### Death of Achilles

After the events of the Iliad, [Achilles](../heroes/achilles.md) was "killed by Paris and [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md)." [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md) "catches away from the pyre and transports to the White Island."[^aeth-death] The [Muses](../deities/groups/muses.md) sang his dirge. His arms were contested between [Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md) and [Ajax](../heroes/ajax.md); Ajax killed himself when he lost.[^aeth-arms]

[^aeth-arms]: Little Iliad, summary by Proclus

### The Wooden Horse and Fall of Troy

[Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md) devised the stratagem of the wooden horse. The Greeks hid warriors inside it, sailed away in apparent retreat, and the Trojans brought it within the walls. At night the Greeks emerged, opened the gates, and sacked the city.[^apd-horse]

[^apd-horse]: Bibliotheca E.5.14-20

### The Returns (Nostoi)

The Greek heroes' returns home were disastrous. [Athena](../deities/athena.md) was angry over Ajax's violation of [Cassandra](../heroes/cassandra.md) at her altar. Many were shipwrecked, scattered, or murdered on arrival. [Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md) wandered for ten years ([Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md)). [Agamemnon](../heroes/agamemnon.md) was murdered by [Clytemnestra](../heroes/clytemnestra.md) on his return.

## Divine Involvement

The gods were deeply divided during the war:

**Pro-Greek:** [Athena](../deities/athena.md), [Hera](../deities/hera.md), [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md), [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md), [Hephaestus](../deities/hephaestus.md)

**Pro-Trojan:** [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md), [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md), [Ares](../deities/ares.md), [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md), [Leto](../deities/leto.md)

[Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) attempted to remain neutral but intervened at various points, sometimes favouring one side, sometimes the other.
