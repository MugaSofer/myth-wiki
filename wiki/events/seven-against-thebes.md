## Overview

The **Seven Against Thebes** is the failed Argive expedition to install Polynices on the throne of [Thebes](../places/thebes.md). Seven champions lead the attack on the city's seven gates. All perish except Adrastus, and the brothers Eteocles and Polynices kill each other in single combat. A generation later, the **Epigoni** — the sons of the fallen — succeed where their fathers failed.

## In the Bibliotheca (3.6.1-3.7.7)

### Cause (3.6.1)

After [Oedipus](../heroes/oedipus.md)'s fall, his sons Eteocles and Polynices agreed to share the throne, ruling in alternation. When Eteocles refused to yield, Polynices "came to Argos, taking with him the necklace and the robe" and was taken in by Adrastus, who married him to his daughter Argia.[^apd-cause]

### The Necklace of Eriphyle (3.6.2)

The seer Amphiaraus foresaw that all champions except Adrastus would perish and refused to join. Polynices bribed Amphiaraus's wife Eriphyle with [Harmonia's necklace](../heroes/cadmus.md), and "she accepted the necklace and persuaded him to march with Adrastus." Amphiaraus "laid his commands on his sons, that, when they were grown up, they should slay their mother and march against Thebes."[^apd-necklace]

### The Seven Champions (3.6.3)

"Having mustered an army with seven leaders, Adrastus hastened to wage war on Thebes. The leaders were these: Adrastus, son of Talaus; Amphiaraus, son of Oicles; Capaneus, son of Hipponous; Hippomedon, son of Aristomachus; Polynices, son of [Oedipus](../heroes/oedipus.md); Tydeus, son of Oeneus; Parthenopaeus, son of Melanion."[^apd-seven]

### Nemean Games (3.6.4)

At Nemea, Hypsipyle showed them a spring while she was nursing the infant Opheltes. "The abandoned boy was killed by a serpent." Amphiaraus interpreted this as an omen: "the sign foreboded the future, and they called the boy Archemorus." They celebrated the Nemean games in his honour.[^apd-nemea]

### [Tiresias](../heroes/tiresias.md)'s Prophecy and the Battle (3.6.7-8)

Tiresias declared "they should be victorious if Menoeceus, son of Creon, would offer himself freely as a sacrifice to [Ares](../deities/ares.md). On hearing that, Menoeceus, son of Creon, slew himself before the gates."[^apd-tiresias]

"Capaneus, seizing a ladder, was climbing up it to the walls, when [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) smote him with a thunderbolt." The brothers "fought a single combat for the kingdom, and slew each other."[^apd-battle]

[Athena](../deities/athena.md) intended to make Tydeus immortal, but when he was given the head of his slayer Melanippus, "Tydeus split open the head and gulped up the brains. But when Athena saw that, in disgust she grudged and withheld the intended benefit."[^apd-tydeus]

Amphiaraus was swallowed by the earth when [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) "cleft the earth by throwing a thunderbolt," and Zeus "made him immortal." Adrastus "alone was saved by his horse Arion," which [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) had sired on [Demeter](../deities/demeter.md).[^apd-amphiaraus]

### Aftermath (3.7.1)

Creon "cast out the Argive dead unburied" and Antigone "stole the body of Polynices, and secretly buried it, and having been detected by Creon himself, she was interred alive in the grave."[^apd-antigone]

### The Epigoni (3.7.2-4)

"Ten years afterwards the sons of the fallen, called the Epigoni, purposed to march against Thebes." Under Alcmaeon's leadership, they conquered the city. The Thebans fled, and [Tiresias](../heroes/tiresias.md) died at the spring of Tilphussa. Manto, his daughter, was dedicated to [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) at Delphi.[^apd-epigoni]

[^apd-seven]: "the leaders were these: Adrastus, son of Talaus; Amphiaraus, son of Oicles; Capaneus, son of Hipponous; Hippomedon, son of Aristomachus... Polynices, son of Oedipus... Tydeus, son of Oeneus... Parthenopaeus, son of Melanion" (Bibliotheca 3.6.3, trans. J.G. Frazer)

[^apd-tiresias]: "he said that they should be victorious if Menoeceus, son of Creon, would offer himself freely as a sacrifice to Ares. On hearing that, Menoeceus, son of Creon, slew himself before the gates" (Bibliotheca 3.6.7, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-battle]: "Capaneus, seizing a ladder, was climbing up it to the walls, when Zeus smote him with a thunderbolt... Eteocles and Polynices, by the resolution of both armies, fought a single combat for the kingdom, and slew each other" (Bibliotheca 3.6.7-8, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-tydeus]: "Athena brought a medicine which she had begged of Zeus, and by which she intended to make him immortal... Tydeus split open the head and gulped up the brains. But when Athena saw that, in disgust she grudged and withheld the intended benefit" (Bibliotheca 3.6.8, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-amphiaraus]: "Zeus cleft the earth by throwing a thunderbolt, and Amphiaraus vanished with his chariot... Adrastus alone was saved by his horse Arion. That horse Poseidon begot on Demeter, when in the likeness of a Fury she consorted with him" (Bibliotheca 3.6.8, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-antigone]: "Antigone, one of the daughters of Oedipus, stole the body of Polynices, and secretly buried it, and having been detected by Creon himself, she was interred alive in the grave" (Bibliotheca 3.7.1, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-epigoni]: "ten years afterwards the sons of the fallen, called the Epigoni, purposed to march against Thebes to avenge the death of their fathers" (Bibliotheca 3.7.2, trans. J.G. Frazer)

## In the Fabulae

The [Fabulae](../sources/hyginus.md) treats the Seven Against Thebes across multiple sections (§68-74), offering variant traditions and emphasizing different narrative elements.

### Three Versions of Polynices' Attack (§68)

The Fabulae gives three distinct accounts. All agree that Polynices "when the year was over, demanded the rule from his brother Eteocles" but "he refused to yield it."[^hyg-68-v1] All three versions mention the same deaths: "Capaneus, because he said he would capture Thebes against Jove's will, was smitten by a thunderbolt as he was scaling the wall. Amphiaraus was swallowed up by the earth; Eteocles and Polynices, fighting together, killed each other."[^hyg-68-deaths]

The first version adds a unique detail about funeral offerings: "When expiatory offerings were made to them in Thebes, although the wind was strong, the smoke never blew in one direction, but some of it was borne one way, some another."[^hyg-68-smoke] This version also includes [Tiresias](../heroes/tiresias.md)' prophecy: "when the others were attacking Thebes, and the Thebans were despairing of their royal family, Tiresias, son of Everes, a prophet, foretold that if anyone of the dragon's descendants should perish, the town would be freed from that disaster. Menoeceus, realizing that he alone of the citizens could bring safety, threw himself from the wall; the Thebans won the victory."[^hyg-68-tiresias]

The second version specifies that "Adrastus, thanks to his horse, escaped."[^hyg-68-v2] It describes the funeral smoke differently: "When a common funeral offering was made to them at Thebes the smoke divided because they had killed each other."[^hyg-68-smoke2]

### The Boar and Lion Oracle (§69)

The Fabulae gives an elaborate account of how Adrastus came to support Polynices. "Oracular reply was given by Apollo to Adrastus, son of Talaus and Eurynome, that he would give his daughters in marriage to a boar and a lion."[^hyg-69-oracle]

When Polynices and Tydeus arrived at Argos — both exiled — they wore distinctive garb: "one wearing a boar's skin, and the other a lion's skin."[^hyg-69-skins] Polynices explained "he had come from Thebes, and he was wearing the insignia of his race," while "Tydeus spoke too, saying that he was the son of Oineus and traced his descent from Calydon, and so he wore a boar skin to recall the Calydonian Boar."[^hyg-69-explain]

Adrastus "gave Argia, the older daughter to Polynices, from whom Thersander was born; Deipyla, the younger, he gave to Tydeus, and she became mother of Diomede who fought at Troy."[^hyg-69-marriages]

The Fabulae adds a detail about the gates: "Amphion, who had surrounded Thebes with a wall set in it seven gates named for his daughters. These were Thera, Cleodoxe, Astynome, Astycratia, Chias, Ogygia, Chloris."[^hyg-69-gates]

### The Seven Leaders (§70)

The Fabulae provides detailed genealogies for each of the seven. Notable details include Amphiaraus "son of Oicleus, or, as other writers say, son of Apollo by Hypermnestra, daughter of Thestius, from Pylos."[^hyg-70-amph]

"All these leaders died at Thebes except Adrastus, son of Talaus. He was saved thanks to his horse."[^hyg-70-horse] Creon "had taken control of Thebes" and ordered "they had lain unburied."[^hyg-70-unburied]

### The Epigoni (§71)

Two versions are given. The first lists "Aegialus, son of Adrastus, by Demonassa, an Argive; he alone of the seven who went out perished; because his father [alone of the first seven] survived, he gave his life vicariously for his father; the other six returned home."[^hyg-71-aegialus]

The second version lists: "Aegialus, son of Adrastus; Polydorus, son of Hippomedon; Sthenelus, son of Capaneus; Alcmaeon, son of Amphiaraus; Thersander, son of Polynices; Biantes, son of Parthenopaeus; Diomede, son of Tydeus."[^hyg-71-v2]

### Antigone (§72)

The Fabulae gives a version different from the Bibliotheca. "Creon, son of Menoeceus, made an edict that no one should bury Polynices or any of those who had come with him." Both "Antigona, Polynices' sister, and Argia, his wife, with secrecy at night took his body and put it on the same pyre where the body of Eteocles was placed."[^hyg-72-pyre]

When caught, "Argia escaped, but Antigona was brought before the king. He gave her to his son Haemon, to whom she was betrothed to be put to death." But "Haemon out of love disobeyed his father's command, entrusted Antigona to shepherds, and falsely claimed he had killed her."[^hyg-72-haemon]

Years later, when their son "came to Thebes to the games; Creon recognized him because all those of the dragon's progeny have a mark on their bodies." When [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) "begged him to pardon Haemon, he did not win his request. Haemon killed himself and his wife Antigona."[^hyg-72-death]

### Amphiaraus and Eriphyle (§73)

"Amphiaraus, son of Oicleus and Hypermnestra, daughter of Thestius, was an augur who knew that if he went to attack Thebes he would not return. And so he hid himself, with the knowledge of his wife Eriphyle."[^hyg-73-hide]

"When Adrastus was hunting for him, however, he made a necklace of gold and gems and offered it as a gift to his sister Eriphyle, who betrayed her husband in her eagerness for the gift."[^hyg-73-necklace] Before leaving, "Amphiaraus instructed his son Alcmaeon to punish his mother after his death. After Amphiaraus was swallowed up by the earth at Thebes, Alcmaeon, remembering his father's instructions, killed his mothers. The Furies later pursued him."[^hyg-73-furies]

### Hypsipyle (§74)

The Fabulae recounts the Nemean episode. Hypsipyle "as a slave, was caring for the boy Archemorus or Ophites, son of King Lycus. He had been warned by an oracle not to put the child on the ground until he could walk."[^hyg-74-oracle]

When the seven leaders "came to Hypsipyle in their search for water," she "fearing to put the boy on the ground," placed him "in" very thick parsley "near the spring." While "she was giving them water, a dragon, guardian of the spring, devoured the child."[^hyg-74-dragon]

"Adrastus and the others killed the dragon, and interceded for Hypsipyle to Lycus, and established funeral games in honour of the boy. They take place every fifth year, and the victors receive a wreath of parsley."[^hyg-74-games]
