## Overview

The **Seven Against Thebes** is the failed Argive expedition to install Polynices on the throne of [Thebes](../places/thebes.md). Seven champions lead the attack on the city's seven gates. All perish except Adrastus, and the brothers Eteocles and Polynices kill each other in single combat. A generation later, the **Epigoni** — the sons of the fallen — succeed where their fathers failed.

## In the Bibliotheca (3.6.1-3.7.7)

### Cause (3.6.1)

After [Oedipus](../heroes/oedipus.md)'s fall, his sons Eteocles and Polynices agreed to share the throne, ruling in alternation. When Eteocles refused to yield, Polynices "came to Argos, taking with him the necklace and the robe" and was taken in by Adrastus, who married him to his daughter Argia.[^apd-cause]

### The Necklace of Eriphyle (3.6.2)

The seer Amphiaraus foresaw that all champions except Adrastus would perish and refused to join. Polynices bribed Amphiaraus's wife Eriphyle with [Harmonia's necklace](../heroes/cadmus.md), and "she accepted the necklace and persuaded him to march with Adrastus." Amphiaraus "laid his commands on his sons, that, when they were grown up, they should slay their mother and march against Thebes."[^apd-necklace]

### The Seven Champions (3.6.3)

"Having mustered an army with seven leaders, Adrastus hastened to wage war on Thebes. The leaders were these: Adrastus, son of Talaus; Amphiaraus, son of Oicles; Capaneus, son of Hipponous; Hippomedon, son of Aristomachus; Polynices, son of [Oedipus](../heroes/oedipus.md); Tydeus, son of Oeneus; Parthenopaeus, son of Melanion."[^apd-seven]

### Nemean Games (3.6.4)

At Nemea, Hypsipyle showed them a spring while she was nursing the infant Opheltes. "The abandoned boy was killed by a serpent." Amphiaraus interpreted this as an omen: "the sign foreboded the future, and they called the boy Archemorus." They celebrated the Nemean games in his honour.[^apd-nemea]

### [Tiresias](../heroes/tiresias.md)'s Prophecy and the Battle (3.6.7-8)

Tiresias declared "they should be victorious if Menoeceus, son of Creon, would offer himself freely as a sacrifice to [Ares](../deities/ares.md). On hearing that, Menoeceus, son of Creon, slew himself before the gates."[^apd-tiresias]

"Capaneus, seizing a ladder, was climbing up it to the walls, when [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) smote him with a thunderbolt." The brothers "fought a single combat for the kingdom, and slew each other."[^apd-battle]

[Athena](../deities/athena.md) intended to make Tydeus immortal, but when he was given the head of his slayer Melanippus, "Tydeus split open the head and gulped up the brains. But when Athena saw that, in disgust she grudged and withheld the intended benefit."[^apd-tydeus]

Amphiaraus was swallowed by the earth when [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) "cleft the earth by throwing a thunderbolt," and Zeus "made him immortal." Adrastus "alone was saved by his horse Arion," which [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) had sired on [Demeter](../deities/demeter.md).[^apd-amphiaraus]

### Aftermath (3.7.1)

Creon "cast out the Argive dead unburied" and Antigone "stole the body of Polynices, and secretly buried it, and having been detected by Creon himself, she was interred alive in the grave."[^apd-antigone]

### The Epigoni (3.7.2-4)

"Ten years afterwards the sons of the fallen, called the Epigoni, purposed to march against Thebes." Under Alcmaeon's leadership, they conquered the city. The Thebans fled, and [Tiresias](../heroes/tiresias.md) died at the spring of Tilphussa. Manto, his daughter, was dedicated to [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) at Delphi.[^apd-epigoni]
