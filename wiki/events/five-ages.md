## Overview

In [Works and Days](../sources/works-and-days.md), Hesiod tells "how the gods and mortal men sprang from one source" through a myth of five successive races, each declining in quality (with one exception). The myth explains the present condition of humanity.[^wd-intro]

[^wd-intro]: "Or if you will, I will sum you up another tale well and skilfully—and do you lay it up in your heart,—how the gods and mortal men sprang from one source" (Works and Days 106-108, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## The Five Ages

### 1. The Golden Age

"First of all the deathless gods who dwell on [Olympus](../places/olympus.md) made a golden race of mortal men who lived in the time of [Cronos](../deities/cronos.md) when he was reigning in heaven." They "lived like gods without sorrow of heart, remote and free from toil and grief: miserable age rested not on them; but with legs and arms never failing they made merry with feasting beyond the reach of all evils." When they died, "it was as though they were overcome with sleep."[^wd-gold]

After death, "they are called pure spirits dwelling on the earth, and are kindly, delivering from harm, and guardians of mortal men; for they roam everywhere over the earth, clothed in mist and keep watch on judgements and cruel deeds, givers of wealth."[^wd-gold-spirits]

[^wd-gold]: "First of all the deathless gods who dwell on Olympus made a golden race of mortal men who lived in the time of Cronos when he was reigning in heaven. And they lived like gods without sorrow of heart, remote and free from toil and grief: miserable age rested not on them; but with legs and arms never failing they made merry with feasting beyond the reach of all evils. When they died, it was as though they were overcome with sleep" (Works and Days 109-116)
[^wd-gold-spirits]: "they are called pure spirits dwelling on the earth, and are kindly, delivering from harm, and guardians of mortal men; for they roam everywhere over the earth, clothed in mist and keep watch on judgements and cruel deeds, givers of wealth" (Works and Days 121-126)

### 2. The Silver Age

"A second generation which was of silver and less noble by far. It was like the golden race neither in body nor in spirit." They lived extraordinarily long childhoods: "A child was brought up at his good mother's side an hundred years, an utter simpleton, playing childishly in his own home." But their adulthood was brief and foolish — "they could not keep from sinning and from wronging one another, nor would they serve the immortals." [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) "was angry and put them away."[^wd-silver]

In death they became "blessed spirits of the underworld... though they are of second order, yet honour attends them also."[^wd-silver-spirits]

[^wd-silver]: "they who dwell on Olympus made a second generation which was of silver and less noble by far. It was like the golden race neither in body nor in spirit. A child was brought up at his good mother's side an hundred years, an utter simpleton, playing childishly in his own home. But when they were full grown and were come to the full measure of their prime, they lived only a little time in sorrow because of their foolishness" (Works and Days 127-134)
[^wd-silver-spirits]: "they are called blessed spirits of the underworld by men, and, though they are of second order, yet honour attends them also" (Works and Days 141-142)

### 3. The Bronze Age

"[Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) the Father made a third generation of mortal men, a brazen race, sprung from ash-trees; and it was in no way equal to the silver age, but was terrible and strong." They "loved the lamentable works of [Ares](../deities/ares.md) and deeds of violence; they ate no bread, but were hard of heart like adamant." Their material world was entirely bronze: "Their armour was of bronze, and their houses of bronze, and of bronze were their implements: there was no black iron." They "were destroyed by their own hands and passed to the dank house of chill [Hades](../deities/hades.md), and left no name."[^wd-bronze]

[^wd-bronze]: "Zeus the Father made a third generation of mortal men, a brazen race, sprung from ash-trees; and it was in no way equal to the silver age, but was terrible and strong. They loved the lamentable works of Ares and deeds of violence; they ate no bread, but were hard of heart like adamant, fearful men. Great was their strength and unconquerable the arms which grew from their shoulders on their strong limbs. Their armour was of bronze, and their houses of bronze, and of bronze were their implements: there was no black iron. These were destroyed by their own hands and passed to the dank house of chill Hades, and left no name" (Works and Days 143-155)

### 4. The Heroic Age

The fourth age breaks the pattern of decline: "[Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) the son of [Cronos](../deities/cronos.md) made yet another, the fourth, upon the fruitful earth, which was nobler and more righteous, a god-like race of hero-men who are called demi-gods, the race before our own."[^wd-heroes]

"Grim war and dread battle destroyed a part of them, some in the land of Cadmus at seven-gated Thebe when they fought for the flocks of Oedipus, and some, when it had brought them in ships over the great sea gulf to Troy for rich-haired Helen's sake."[^wd-wars]

The surviving heroes were given a blessed afterlife: "[Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) gave a living and an abode apart from men, and made them dwell at the ends of earth. And they live untouched by sorrow in the islands of the blessed along the shore of deep swirling Ocean, happy heroes for whom the grain-giving earth bears honey-sweet fruit flourishing thrice a year, far from the deathless gods, and [Cronos](../deities/cronos.md) rules over them."[^wd-blessed]

[^wd-heroes]: "Zeus the son of Cronos made yet another, the fourth, upon the fruitful earth, which was nobler and more righteous, a god-like race of hero-men who are called demi-gods, the race before our own, throughout the boundless earth" (Works and Days 156-160)
[^wd-wars]: "Grim war and dread battle destroyed a part of them, some in the land of Cadmus at seven-gated Thebe when they fought for the flocks of Oedipus, and some, when it had brought them in ships over the great sea gulf to Troy for rich-haired Helen's sake" (Works and Days 161-165)
[^wd-blessed]: "to the others father Zeus the son of Cronos gave a living and an abode apart from men, and made them dwell at the ends of earth. And they live untouched by sorrow in the islands of the blessed along the shore of deep swirling Ocean, happy heroes for whom the grain-giving earth bears honey-sweet fruit flourishing thrice a year, far from the deathless gods, and Cronos rules over them; for the father of men and gods released him from his bonds" (Works and Days 166-173)

### 5. The Iron Age

Hesiod's own age — the present: "Thereafter, would that I were not among the men of the fifth generation, but either had died before or been born afterwards. For now truly is a race of iron, and men never rest from labour and sorrow by day, and from perishing by night; and the gods shall lay sore trouble upon them."[^wd-iron]

This age will end when moral decay is complete: "The father will not agree with his children, nor the children with their father, nor guest with his host, nor comrade with comrade; nor will brother be dear to brother as aforetime." Eventually "Aidos and Nemesis, with their sweet forms wrapped in white robes, will go from the wide-pathed earth and forsake mankind to join the company of the deathless gods: and bitter sorrows will be left for mortal men, and there will be no help against evil."[^wd-iron-end]

[^wd-iron]: "Thereafter, would that I were not among the men of the fifth generation, but either had died before or been born afterwards. For now truly is a race of iron, and men never rest from labour and sorrow by day, and from perishing by night; and the gods shall lay sore trouble upon them" (Works and Days 174-178)
[^wd-iron-end]: "The father will not agree with his children, nor the children with their father, nor guest with his host, nor comrade with comrade; nor will brother be dear to brother as aforetime... And then Aidos and Nemesis, with their sweet forms wrapped in white robes, will go from the wide-pathed earth and forsake mankind to join the company of the deathless gods: and bitter sorrows will be left for mortal men, and there will be no help against evil" (Works and Days 182-201)

## In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md)

Ovid retells the myth as the **Four Ages of Man**, omitting Hesiod's Heroic Age entirely and proceeding directly from Gold to Silver to Bronze to Iron. The sequence follows [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md)'s (Jove's) overthrow of [Cronos](../deities/cronos.md) (Saturn).

### The Golden Age

Under Cronos, "rectitude spontaneous in the heart prevailed, and faith." There were no laws, no judges, no punishment. No ships sailed, no wars were fought, and "of her own accord the earth produced a store of every fruit." It was a time of "Eternal Spring," when "rivers flowed milk and nectar, and the trees, the very oak trees, then gave honey of themselves."[^met-fiveages-1]

### The Silver and Bronze Ages

When [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) overthrew Cronos, the Silver Age began, "though not so good as gold but still surpassing yellow brass." Zeus "first reduced to years the Primal Spring" and introduced the four seasons, driving men to build shelters and plant crops.[^met-fiveages-2] The Bronze Age followed, "when cruel people were inclined to arms but not to impious crimes."[^met-fiveages-3]

### The Iron Age

The final age brought complete moral collapse: "modesty and faith and truth took flight, and in their stead deceits and snares and frauds and violence and wicked love of gain, succeeded." Men mined the earth for gold and iron, bringing war. Family bonds dissolved: "The husband threatened to destroy his wife, and she her husband: horrid step dames mixed the deadly henbane." The age ended when "the virgin deity, Astraea vanished from the blood-stained earth."[^met-fiveages-4]

[^met-fiveages-1]: "First was the Golden Age. Then rectitude spontaneous in the heart prevailed, and faith... of her own accord the earth produced a store of every fruit... Eternal Spring! Soft breathing zephyrs soothed and warmly cherished buds and blooms... rivers flowed milk and nectar, and the trees, the very oak trees, then gave honey of themselves" (Metamorphoses 1.89-112, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-fiveages-2]: "When Saturn had been banished into night and all the world was ruled by Jove supreme, the Silver Age, though not so good as gold but still surpassing yellow brass, prevailed. Jove first reduced to years the Primal Spring" (Metamorphoses 1.113-116, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-fiveages-3]: "The third Age followed, called The Age of Bronze, when cruel people were inclined to arms but not to impious crimes" (Metamorphoses 1.125-127, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-fiveages-4]: "modesty and faith and truth took flight, and in their stead deceits and snares and frauds and violence and wicked love of gain, succeeded... the virgin deity, Astraea vanished from the blood-stained earth" (Metamorphoses 1.129-150, trans. Brookes More)

## Notes

The Five Ages myth is notable for breaking its own pattern: the decline from Gold to Silver to Bronze is interrupted by the Heroic Age, which is "nobler and more righteous" than the Bronze. This has been taken as Hesiod inserting the established tradition of the heroic age (the age of the Trojan War and Thebes) into what was originally a four-stage myth of decline.

The Golden Age under [Cronos](../deities/cronos.md) creates an interesting tension with the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md), where Cronos is portrayed as the tyrant who swallowed his children. Here he presides over a paradise, and even rules the Islands of the Blessed after being "released from his bonds" by [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md).
