## Overview

**Deucalion's Flood** is the great deluge sent by [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) to destroy the Bronze Age of humanity. Deucalion, son of Prometheus, and his wife Pyrrha survived by floating in a chest. After landing on Mount Parnassus, they repopulated the earth by throwing stones over their shoulders, which became men and women. Their children became the ancestors of the Hellenic peoples.

## Deucalion and Pyrrha

Deucalion was "a son of Prometheus" who "reigning in the regions about Phthia, married Pyrrha, the daughter of Epimetheus and Pandora, the first woman fashioned by the gods."[^apd-lineage] The Hesiodic Catalogue confirms: "Deucalion was the son of Prometheus and Pronoea, Hesiod states in the first Catalogue, as also that Hellen was the son of Deucalion and Pyrrha."[^hes-lineage]

Deucalion and Pyrrha thus unite two lines: Deucalion descends from the Titan Prometheus (benefactor of mankind), and Pyrrha from Epimetheus and Pandora (the first woman created by the gods as described in [Works and Days](../sources/works-and-days.md)).

[^apd-lineage]: "Prometheus had a son Deucalion. He reigning in the regions about Phthia, married Pyrrha, the daughter of Epimetheus and Pandora, the first woman fashioned by the gods" (Bibliotheca 1.7.2, trans. Frazer)
[^hes-lineage]: "Deucalion was the son of Prometheus and Pronoea, Hesiod states in the first Catalogue, as also that Hellen was the son of Deucalion and Pyrrha" (Catalogue of Women, Fragment 1, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## The Flood

"When Zeus would destroy the men of the Bronze Age, Deucalion by the advice of Prometheus constructed a chest, and having stored it with provisions he embarked in it with Pyrrha."[^apd-chest]

The destruction was vast: "Zeus by pouring heavy rain from heaven flooded the greater part of Greece, so that all men were destroyed, except a few who fled to the high mountains in the neighborhood. It was then that the mountains in Thessaly parted, and that all the world outside the Isthmus and Peloponnese was overwhelmed."[^apd-flood]

"Deucalion, floating in the chest over the sea for nine days and as many nights, drifted to Parnassus, and there, when the rain ceased, he landed and sacrificed to Zeus, the god of Escape."[^apd-landing]

## Refounding Humanity

After the sacrifice, "Zeus sent Hermes to him and allowed him to choose what he would, and he chose to get men."[^apd-hermes] The method was extraordinary: "at the bidding of Zeus he took up stones and threw them over his head, and the stones which Deucalion threw became men, and the stones which Pyrrha threw became women."[^apd-stones]

This gave rise to an etymology: "Hence people were called metaphorically people (laos) from laas, 'a stone.'"[^apd-etymology] The Hesiodic tradition preserves the same wordplay: "For Locrus truly was leader of the Lelegian people, whom Zeus the Son of Cronos, whose wisdom is unfailing, gave to Deucalion, stones gathered out of the earth. So out of stones mortal men were made, and they were called people."[^hes-stones]

## The Children of Deucalion

"Deucalion had children by Pyrrha, first Hellen, whose father some say was Zeus, and second Amphictyon, who reigned over Attica after Cranaus; and third a daughter Protogenia, who became the mother of Aethlius by Zeus."[^apd-children]

Hellen became the ancestor of the Hellenic peoples. The Hesiodic Catalogue confirms that "those who were descended from Deucalion used to rule over Thessaly."[^hes-thessaly] Deucalion's daughter Thyia bore to [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) "two sons, Magnes and Macedon, rejoicing in horses, who dwell round about Pieria and Olympus."[^hes-thyia]

The Catalogue also gives Hellen's descendants: "from Hellen the war-loving king sprang Dorus and Xuthus and Aeolus delighting in horses. And the sons of Aeolus, kings dealing justice, were Cretheus, and Athamas, and clever Sisyphus, and wicked Salmoneus and overbold Perieres."[^hes-hellen]

Another tradition gives Deucalion a daughter Pandora, "joined in love with father Zeus, leader of all the gods," who "bare Graecus, staunch in battle."[^hes-graecus]

[^hes-hellen]: "from Hellen the war-loving king sprang Dorus and Xuthus and Aeolus delighting in horses. And the sons of Aeolus, kings dealing justice, were Cretheus, and Athamas, and clever Sisyphus, and wicked Salmoneus and overbold Perieres" (Catalogue of Women, Fragment 4, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

[^hes-thessaly]: "Those who were descended from Deucalion used to rule over Thessaly" (Catalogue of Women, Fragment 5, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^hes-thyia]: "she conceived and bare to Zeus who delights in the thunderbolt two sons, Magnes and Macedon, rejoicing in horses, who dwell round about Pieria and Olympus" (Catalogue of Women, Fragment 3, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^hes-graecus]: "in the palace Pandora the daughter of noble Deucalion was joined in love with father Zeus, leader of all the gods, and bare Graecus, staunch in battle" (Catalogue of Women, Fragment 2, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Gods and Mortals Together (Fragment 59)

The Catalogue preserves a memory of a time before the separation of gods and mortals: "For in common then were the banquets, and in common the seats of deathless gods and mortal men."[^cat-common] This fragment reflects the theological backdrop against which the Flood and the Trojan War both operate — [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md)'s plan to end the age when gods and mortals mingled freely.

[^cat-common]: "For in common then were the banquets, and in common the seats of deathless gods and mortal men" (Catalogue of Women, Fragment 59, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Connection to the Five Ages

The flood is explicitly linked to the [Five Ages of Man](five-ages.md): [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) sent it to destroy "the men of the Bronze Age."[^apd-bronze-age] In [Works and Days](../sources/works-and-days.md), the Bronze Age men "were destroyed by their own hands and passed to the dank house of chill Hades, and left no name."[^wd-bronze] The Apollodorus account provides the mechanism for this destruction — the flood — though Works and Days attributes their end to self-destruction through violence.

The Hesiodic scholiast confirms that "the oracle was first consulted by Deucalion and Pyrrha after the Flood" — referring to the oracle at Dodona.[^hes-dodona]

## Other References

Apollodorus mentions the flood in connection with Lycaon's sons: "when Nyctimus succeeded to the kingdom, there occurred the flood in the age of Deucalion; some said that it was occasioned by the impiety of Lycaon's sons."[^apd-lycaon] The flood is also dated by the Athenian king-list: "it was in his time that the flood in the age of Deucalion is said to have taken place," referring to the reign of Cranaus.[^apd-cranaus]

In the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md), a different Deucalion (son of Minos) appears as father of Idomeneus: "Deucalion, high of heart. Now Deucalion begat me and Idomeneus the prince."[^od19-deucalion] This is a distinct figure from the flood survivor.

[^apd-lycaon]: "when Nyctimus succeeded to the kingdom, there occurred the flood in the age of Deucalion; some said that it was occasioned by the impiety of Lycaon's sons" (Bibliotheca 3.8.2, trans. Frazer)
