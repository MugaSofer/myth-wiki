## Overview

The **Calydonian Boar Hunt** was a great communal hunt called by Oeneus, king of Calydon, against a monstrous boar sent by [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md) in anger. The hunt drew heroes from across Greece, but its aftermath — a dispute over the boar's hide — led to war between the Curetes and Calydonians and to the death of Meleager.

## The Boar's Origin

Both the Iliad and Apollodorus agree that [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md) sent the boar because Oeneus neglected her in his offerings. In the Iliad, Phoenix tells the story: "Artemis of the golden throne had brought a plague upon them, in wrath that Oineus offered her not the harvest first-fruits on the fat of his garden land; for all the other gods had their feast of hecatombs, and only to the daughter of great Zeus offered he not, whether he forgat or marked it not; and therein sinned he sore in his heart."[^il9-cause]

Apollodorus gives the same cause: "In sacrificing the first fruits of the annual crops of the country to all the gods Oeneus forgot Artemis alone. But she in her wrath sent a boar of extraordinary size and strength, which prevented the land from being sown and destroyed the cattle and the people that fell in with it."[^apd-cause]

The Iliad describes the boar as "a fierce wild boar, white-tusked, that wrought sore ill continually on Oineus' garden land; many a tall tree laid he low utterly, even root and apple blossom therewith."[^il9-boar]

[^il9-cause]: "Artemis of the golden throne had brought a plague upon them, in wrath that Oineus offered her not the harvest first-fruits on the fat of his garden land; for all the other gods had their feast of hecatombs, and only to the daughter of great Zeus offered he not, whether he forgat or marked it not; and therein sinned he sore in his heart" (Iliad 9.519-525, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

But she in her wrath sent a boar of extraordinary size and strength, which prevented the land from being sown and destroyed the cattle and the people that fell in with it" (Bibliotheca 1.8.2, trans. Frazer)

## The Hunters

Apollodorus provides a full catalogue. "To attack this boar Oeneus called together all the noblest men of Greece, and promised that to him who should kill the beast he would give the skin as a prize."[^apd-call] The hunters included:

- Meleager, son of Oeneus, and Dryas, son of [Ares](../deities/ares.md) — from Calydon
- Idas and Lynceus — from Messene
- Castor and Pollux, sons of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) — from Lacedaemon
- Theseus — from Athens
- Admetus — from Pherae
- Ancaeus and Cepheus — from Arcadia
- Jason — from Iolcus
- Iphicles — from Thebes
- Pirithous — from Larissa
- Peleus and Telamon — from Salamis and Phthia
- Atalanta — daughter of Schoeneus
- Amphiaraus — from Argos
- The sons of Thestius[^apd-catalogue]

In the Iliad, the event is described more generally: "him slew Meleagros the son of Oineus, having gathered together from many cities huntsmen and hounds; for not of few men could the boar be slain, so mighty was he."[^il9-hunt]

[^apd-catalogue]: "Meleager, son of Oeneus; Dryas, son of Ares; these came from Calydon; Idas and Lynceus, sons of Aphareus, from Messene; Castor and Pollux, sons of Zeus and Leda, from Lacedaemon; Theseus, son of Aegeus, from Athens; Admetus, son of Pheres, from Pherae; Ancaeus and Cepheus, sons of Lycurgus, from Arcadia; Jason, son of Aeson, from Iolcus" (Bibliotheca 1.8.2, trans. Frazer)
[^il9-hunt]: "him slew Meleagros the son of Oineus, having gathered together from many cities huntsmen and hounds; for not of few men could the boar be slain, so mighty was he; and many an one brought he to the grievous pyre" (Iliad 9.528-532, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

## The Kill and the Dispute

### Apollodorus's Account

Oeneus entertained the hunters for nine days. On the tenth, some men "disdained to go hunting with a woman," but "Meleager compelled them to follow the chase with her, for he desired to have a child also by Atalanta, though he had to wife Cleopatra."[^apd-atalanta]

In the hunt, "Hyleus and Ancaeus were killed by the brute, and Peleus struck down Eurytion undesignedly with a javelin. But Atalanta was the first to shoot the boar in the back with an arrow, and Amphiaraus was the next to shoot it in the eye; but Meleager killed it by a stab in the flank, and on receiving the skin gave it to Atalanta."[^apd-kill]

The sons of Thestius (Althaea's brothers) seized the skin from Atalanta, "thinking scorn that a woman should get the prize in the face of men" and "alleging that it belonged to them by right of birth if Meleager did not choose to take it."[^apd-dispute]

[^apd-atalanta]: "Meleager compelled them to follow the chase with her, for he desired to have a child also by Atalanta, though he had to wife Cleopatra, daughter of Idas and Marpessa" (Bibliotheca 1.8.2, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-kill]: "Atalanta was the first to shoot the boar in the back with an arrow, and Amphiaraus was the next to shoot it in the eye; but Meleager killed it by a stab in the flank, and on receiving the skin gave it to Atalanta" (Bibliotheca 1.8.2, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-dispute]: "the sons of Thestius, thinking scorn that a woman should get the prize in the face of men, took the skin from her, alleging that it belonged to them by right of birth if Meleager did not choose to take it" (Bibliotheca 1.8.2, trans. Frazer)

### The Iliad's Account

In the Iliad, the dispute is over "the boar's head and shaggy hide" and leads not to personal violence but to war: "the goddess made much turmoil over him and tumult concerning the boar's head and shaggy hide, between the Kuretes and great-hearted Aitolians."[^il9-turmoil]

[^il9-turmoil]: "the goddess made much turmoil over him and tumult concerning the boar's head and shaggy hide, between the Kuretes and great-hearted Aitolians" (Iliad 9.532-534, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

## The Death of Meleager

### The Brand (Apollodorus)

Apollodorus tells of a prophecy at Meleager's birth: "when he was seven days old, the Fates came and declared that Meleager should die when the brand burning on the hearth was burnt out. On hearing that, Althaea snatched up the brand and deposited it in a chest."[^apd-brand]

After Meleager killed the sons of Thestius in rage, "from grief at the slaughter of her brothers Althaea kindled the brand, and Meleager immediately expired."[^apd-brand-death]

[^apd-brand]: "when he was seven days old, the Fates came and declared that Meleager should die when the brand burning on the hearth was burnt out. On hearing that, Althaea snatched up the brand and deposited it in a chest" (Bibliotheca 1.8.2, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-brand-death]: "from grief at the slaughter of her brothers Althaea kindled the brand, and Meleager immediately expired" (Bibliotheca 1.8.3, trans. Frazer)

### The Withdrawal (Iliad)

The Iliad tells a different version, where Meleager withdrew from battle in anger at his mother's curse. "So long as Meleagros dear to Ares fought, so long it went ill with the Kuretes, neither dared they face him without their city walls, for all they were very many."[^il9-fighting] But when his mother Althaea cursed him, "grieved for her brethren's death," she "prayed instantly to the gods, and with her hands likewise beat instantly upon the fertile earth, calling on Hades and dread Persephone... to bring her son to death; and Erinnys that walketh in darkness, whose heart knoweth not ruth, heard her from Erebos."[^il9-curse]

Meleager withdrew to his wife Kleopatra and refused all pleas — from the elders of the Aetolians, from his father Oeneus, from his sisters and mother, and from his dearest comrades. Only when "his chamber was now hotly battered and the Kuretes were climbing upon the towers and firing the great city" did his wife persuade him to fight. "So he saved the Aitolians from the evil day, obeying his own will; but they paid him not now the gifts many and gracious; yet nevertheless he drave away destruction."[^il9-return]

[^il9-fighting]: "So long as Meleagros dear to Ares fought, so long it went ill with the Kuretes, neither dared they face him without their city walls, for all they were very many" (Iliad 9.535-537, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il9-curse]: "she, grieved for her brethren's death, prayed instantly to the gods, and with her hands likewise beat instantly upon the fertile earth, calling on Hades and dread Persephone, while she knelt upon her knees and made her bosom wet with tears, to bring her son to death; and Erinnys that walketh in darkness, whose heart knoweth not ruth, heard her from Erebos" (Iliad 9.550-555, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il9-return]: "So he saved the Aitolians from the evil day, obeying his own will; but they paid him not now the gifts many and gracious; yet nevertheless he drave away destruction" (Iliad 9.577-579, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

### The Alternate Version (Apollodorus)

Apollodorus also records a variant that closely matches the Iliad: "some say that Meleager did not die in that way, but that when the sons of Thestius claimed the skin on the ground that Iphiclus had been the first to hit the boar, war broke out between the Curetes and the Calydonians." Meleager "in a rage remained at home" but "when the enemy approached the walls, and the citizens supplicated him to come to the rescue, he yielded reluctantly to his wife and sallied forth, and having killed the rest of the sons of Thestius, he himself fell fighting."[^apd-variant]

"After the death of Meleager, Althaea and Cleopatra hanged themselves, and the women who mourned the dead man were turned into birds."[^apd-aftermath]

[^apd-variant]: "some say that Meleager did not die in that way, but that when the sons of Thestius claimed the skin on the ground that Iphiclus had been the first to hit the boar, war broke out between the Curetes and the Calydonians; and when Meleager had sallied out and slain some of the sons of Thestius, Althaea cursed him, and he in a rage remained at home; however, when the enemy approached the walls, and the citizens supplicated him to come to the rescue, he yielded reluctantly to his wife and sallied forth, and having killed the rest of the sons of Thestius, he himself fell fighting" (Bibliotheca 1.8.3, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-aftermath]: "After the death of Meleager, Althaea and Cleopatra hanged themselves, and the women who mourned the dead man were turned into birds" (Bibliotheca 1.8.3, trans. Frazer)

## Meleager in Other Sources

The Hesiodic tradition describes Meleager as a formidable warrior: "strong Meleager loved of Ares, the golden-haired, dear son of Oeneus and Althaea. From his fierce eyes there shone forth portentous fire: and once in high Calydon he slew the destroying beast, the fierce wild boar with gleaming tusks."[^hes-meleager] Notably, Hesiod says "he was slain by the hands and arrows of Apollo, while he was fighting with the Curetes for pleasant Calydon" — a different death tradition from both the Iliad and Apollodorus.[^hes-death]

Apollodorus also mentions that Meleager's shade appeared to [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) in the underworld: when Heracles descended to Hades, "the souls fled, save Meleager and the Gorgon Medusa."[^apd-hades]

Apollodorus records Meleager's possible divine parentage: "Althaea had also a son Meleager, by Oeneus, though they say that he was begotten by [Ares](../deities/ares.md)."[^apd-ares]

[^hes-meleager]: "strong Meleager loved of Ares, the golden-haired, dear son of Oeneus and Althaea. From his fierce eyes there shone forth portentous fire: and once in high Calydon he slew the destroying beast, the fierce wild boar with gleaming tusks" (Catalogue of Women, ll. 99-100, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^hes-death]: "he was slain by the hands and arrows of Apollo, while he was fighting with the Curetes for pleasant Calydon" (Catalogue of Women, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^apd-hades]: "when the souls saw him, they fled, save Meleager and the Gorgon Medusa" (Bibliotheca 2.5.12, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-ares]: "Althaea had also a son Meleager, by Oeneus, though they say that he was begotten by Ares" (Bibliotheca 1.8.2, trans. Frazer)

## Context in the Iliad

Phoenix tells the Meleager story in Iliad IX as a cautionary parallel to [Achilles](../heroes/achilles.md)' withdrawal from battle. Just as Meleager refused gifts and pleas until forced by desperation to fight — and then received no gifts — so too Achilles risks losing his promised rewards if he waits too long to return to battle. The parallel is pointed: "be not thine heart thus minded, neither let heaven so guide thee, dear son; that were a hard thing, to save the ships already burning. Nay, come for the gifts."[^il9-moral]

By the time of the Iliad's narrative present, "golden-haired Meleagros was dead, to whose hands all had been committed, for him to be king of the Aitolians."[^il2-dead]

[^il9-moral]: "be not thine heart thus minded, neither let heaven so guide thee, dear son; that were a hard thing, to save the ships already burning. Nay, come for the gifts" (Iliad 9.580-583, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il2-dead]: "golden-haired Meleagros was dead, to whose hands all had been committed, for him to be king of the Aitolians" (Iliad 2.623-624, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

## In the Fabulae

The [Fabulae](../sources/hyginus.md) presents the story across four consecutive sections, emphasizing different aspects.

### The Brand Prophecy (§171, §174)

At Meleager's birth, "the Fates, Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos, appeared" and "sang his fate: Clotho said that he would be noble, Lachesis that he would be brave, but Atropos looking at a brand burning on the hearth and said, 'He will live only as long as this brand remains unconsumed.'"[^hyg-171] When Althaea heard this, "she leaped from the bed, put out the fatal brand, and buried it in the midst of the palace."[^hyg-171-save]

The Fabulae notes unusual parentage: "Oineus and Mars both slept one night with Althaea, daughter of Thestius."[^hyg-171-parents]

### Oeneus's Omission (§172)

"Oineus, son of Porthaon, king of Aitolia, had made sacrifices yearly to all the gods, but had omitted Diana." In response, "she, in anger, sent a boar of immense size to lay waste the district of Calydon."[^hyg-172]

### The Hunters (§173)

The Fabulae provides an extensive catalogue of hunters who came to Calydon, listing 31 named heroes including notable figures not in Apollodorus's list, such as [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) (as Iolaus's companion), Phoenix, Laertes, and Deucalion. The list concludes with "Atalanta, daughter of Schoeneus."[^hyg-173-atalanta]

A separate section (§173A) lists the states that sent help: "Ternerdos, Iolcos, Sparta, Pleurone, Messene, Perrhaebia, Phthia, Magnesia, Salamin, Calydon, Thessalia, Oichalia, Ithaca, Tegea, Crete, Dolopia, Athens, [Magnesia], and Arcadia."[^hyg-173a]

### Meleager's Death (§174)

After Meleager "killed" the boar "with the help of chosen youths of Greece," he "gave the hide to the virgin Atalanta because of her valor."[^hyg-174-hide] When Althaea's brothers — "Ideus, Plexippus, Lynceus" — "wished to take if from her," Meleager "putting love before family relationship, killed his uncles."[^hyg-174-uncles]

"When Althaea, the mother, heard that her son had dared to commit such a crime, remembering the warning of the Parcae, she brought out the brand from the chest and threw it on the fire."[^hyg-174-burn]

The Fabulae adds details about the aftermath: Meleager's sisters "because of their weeping, were by the will of the gods changed into birds. These are called Meleagrides, 'guinea hens.'" Only "Gorge and Deianeira" were excepted. "And Alcyone, wife of Meleager, died from grief in mourning for him."[^hyg-174-birds]

[^hyg-171]: "the Fates, Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos, appeared. They thus sang his fate: Clotho said that he would be noble, Lachesis that he would be brave, but Atropos looking at a brand burning on the hearth and said, 'He will live only as long as this brand remains unconsumed'" (Fabulae §171, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-171-save]: "she leaped from the bed, put out the fatal brand, and buried it in the midst of the palace, so that it shouldn't be destroyed by fire" (Fabulae §171, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-171-parents]: "Oineus and Mars both slept one night with Althaea, daughter of Thestius" (Fabulae §171, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-172]: "Oineus, son of Porthaon, king of Aitolia, had made sacrifices yearly to all the gods, but had omitted Diana, she, in anger, sent a boar of immense size to lay waste the district of Calydon" (Fabulae §172, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-173-atalanta]: "Atalanta, daughter of Schoeneus" (Fabulae §173, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-173a]: "Ternerdos, Iolcos, Sparta, Pleurone, Messene, Perrhaebia, Phthia, Magnesia, Salamin, Calydon, Thessalia, Oichalia, Ithaca, Tegea, Crete, Dolopia, Athens, [Magnesia], and Arcadia" (Fabulae §173A, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-174-hide]: "killed it, and gave the hide to the virgin Atalanta because of her valor" (Fabulae §174, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-174-uncles]: "Ideus, Plexippus, Lynceus . . . brothers of Althaea, wished to take if from her. When she asked the help of Meleager, he intervened, and putting love before family relationship, killed his uncles" (Fabulae §174, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-174-burn]: "When Althaea, the mother, heard that her son had dared to commit such a crime, remembering the warning of the Parcae, she brought out the brand from the chest and threw it on the fire" (Fabulae §174, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-174-birds]: "his sisters, all except Gorge and Deianeira, because of their weeping, were by the will of the gods changed into birds. These are called Meleagrides, 'guinea hens.' And Alcyone, wife of Meleager, died from grief in mourning for him" (Fabulae §174, trans. Mary Grant)

## In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md) (8.262-532)

### Diana's Revenge (8.262-328)

Ovid provides the most elaborate telling. King Oeneus had "decreed that all should offer the first fruits of corn to Ceres — and to Bacchus wine of grapes — and oil of olives to the golden haired Minerva. Thus, the Gods were all adored... except alone Diana, and of all the Gods her altars only were neglected." [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md) cried: "Though I am thus dishonored, I will not be unrevenged!" and sent the boar.[^met-cb-diana]

The boar is described vividly: "His burning, bloodshot eyes seemed coals of living fire, and his rough neck was knotted with stiff muscles, and thick-set with bristles like sharp spikes. A seething froth dripped on his shoulders, and his tusks were like the spoils of Ind. Discordant roars reverberated from his hideous jaws; and lightning — belched forth from his horrid throat — scorched the green fields."[^met-cb-boar]

### The Hunters and the Hunt (8.300-425)

The catalogue of heroes includes Castor and Pollux, [Jason](../heroes/jason.md), [Theseus](../heroes/theseus.md) with Pirithous, Telamon, [Peleus](../heroes/peleus.md), Nestor, and [Atalanta](../heroes/atalanta.md), described as "virgin of the groves, of Mount Lycaeus, glory of her sex; a polished buckle fastened her attire; her lustrous hair was fashioned in a knot." Meleager saw her and "at once longed for her beauty."[^met-cb-atalanta]

The hunt is chaotic: spears miss, [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) guides one dart but Diana "struck the iron head from the shaft" so only blunt wood hit the boar. Ancaeus, boasting that "weapons of a man excel a woman's," was gored through the groin. Nestor "vaulted on his long lance from the ground into the branches of a sheltering tree." Atalanta shot the arrow that first drew blood — "the feathered shaft quivered beneath the monster's ear" — and Meleager cried "Give honor to the courage of a maid!"[^met-cb-hunt]

Meleager dealt the killing blow, plunging a spear into the boar's shoulder. He gave the spoils to Atalanta: "O Atalanta, glorious maid, of Nonacris, to you is yielded spoil."[^met-cb-kill]

### Althaea and the Brand (8.445-532)

The sons of Thestius seized the trophy from Atalanta. Meleager killed both Plexippus and Toxeus. His mother Althaea remembered the three Fates at his birth, who cast a billet in the flames and chanted: "Unto you we give, O child new-born! only the life of this; the period of this billet is your life." She had snatched it from the fire and hidden it.[^met-cb-fates]

Now torn between mother's love and sister's vengeance — "as when the wind has seized upon a ship and blows against a tide of equal force" — she addressed the Eumenides: "I am avenging and committing crime! With death must death be justified and crime be added unto crime!" She cast the brand into the fire, and Meleager died in agony as it burned.[^met-cb-brand]

[^met-cb-diana]: "except alone Diana, and of all the Gods her altars only were neglected... 'Though I am thus dishonored, I will not be unrevenged!'" (Metamorphoses 8.280-286, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-cb-boar]: "His burning, bloodshot eyes seemed coals of living fire, and his rough neck was knotted with stiff muscles, and thick-set with bristles like sharp spikes. A seething froth dripped on his shoulders, and his tusks were like the spoils of Ind" (Metamorphoses 8.284-290)
[^met-cb-atalanta]: "Atalanta, virgin of the groves, of Mount Lycaeus, glory of her sex; a polished buckle fastened her attire; her lustrous hair was fashioned in a knot... When Meleager saw her, he at once longed for her beauty" (Metamorphoses 8.317-326)
[^met-cb-hunt]: "the feathered shaft quivered beneath the monster's ear, the red blood stained his hard bristles... 'Give honor to the courage of a maid!'" (Metamorphoses 8.380-391)
[^met-cb-kill]: "O Atalanta, glorious maid, of Nonacris, to you is yielded spoil, my lawful right, and I rejoice to share the merit of this glorious victory" (Metamorphoses 8.425-432)
[^met-cb-fates]: "the three attendant sisters of his fate... as they spun and drew the fatal threads they softly chanted, 'Unto you we give, O child new-born! only the life of this; the period of this billet is your life'" (Metamorphoses 8.452-460)
[^met-cb-brand]: "I am avenging and committing crime! With death must death be justified and crime be added unto crime!" (Metamorphoses 8.490-494)
