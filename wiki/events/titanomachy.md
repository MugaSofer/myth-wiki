## Overview

The **Titanomachy** was the ten-year war between [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) and the Olympian gods, based on [Olympus](../places/olympus.md), against the [Titan](../deities/titans.md) gods, based on Mount Othrys. The war was decided by Zeus's release of the [Hundred-Handers](../creatures/hundred-handers.md) and his unleashing of thunder and lightning.

## Background

The [Titans](../deities/titans.md) and the Olympians "had long been fighting together in stubborn war with heart-grieving toil, the lordly Titans from high Othrys, but the gods, givers of good, whom rich-haired [Rhea](../deities/rhea.md) bare in union with [Cronos](../deities/cronos.md), from [Olympus](../places/olympus.md)."[^theog-sides] The war lasted "ten full years, and the hard strife had no close or end for either side, and the issue of the war hung evenly balanced."[^theog-stalemate]

[^theog-sides]: "the lordly Titans from high Othrys, but the gods, givers of good, whom rich-haired Rhea bare in union with Cronos, from Olympus." (Theogony 629-634)
[^theog-stalemate]: "for ten full years, and the hard strife had no close or end for either side, and the issue of the war hung evenly balanced." (Theogony 635-638)

## Sequence of Events

### Release of the Hundred-Handers

[Uranus](../deities/uranus.md) had imprisoned the [Hundred-Handers](../creatures/hundred-handers.md) (Cottus, Briareos, Gyes) "in cruel bonds, because he was jealous of their exceeding manhood and comeliness and great size."[^theog-prison] At [Gaia](../deities/gaia.md)'s advice, Zeus and the Olympians "brought them up again to the light from [Erebus](../deities/erebus.md) beneath the earth," for "with these they would gain victory."[^theog-release]

Zeus addressed them: "Remember our friendly kindness, and from what sufferings you are come back to the light from your cruel bondage under misty gloom through our counsels."[^theog-speech] Cottus pledged their support.[^theog-pledge]

[^theog-prison]: "he bound them in cruel bonds, because he was jealous of their exceeding manhood and comeliness and great size" (Theogony 617-620)
[^theog-release]: "brought them up again to the light at Earth's advising. For she herself recounted all things to the gods fully, how that with these they would gain victory" (Theogony 624-628)
[^theog-speech]: "remember our friendly kindness, and from what sufferings you are come back to the light from your cruel bondage under misty gloom through our counsels." (Theogony 651-653)
[^theog-pledge]: "'Divine one, you speak that which we know well: nay, even of ourselves we know that your wisdom and understanding is exceeding, and that you became a defender of the deathless ones from chill doom.'" ... "'we will aid your power in dreadful strife and will fight against the Titans in hard battle.'" (Theogony 655-663)

### The Battle

Both sides engaged — the [Hundred-Handers](../creatures/hundred-handers.md) "holding huge rocks in their strong hands."[^theog-rocks] The scale was cosmic: "The boundless sea rang terribly around, and the earth crashed loudly: wide Heaven was shaken and groaned, and high [Olympus](../places/olympus.md) reeled from its foundation under the charge of the undying gods, and a heavy quaking reached dim [Tartarus](../places/tartarus.md)."[^theog-scale]

[Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) then "no longer held back his might; but straight his heart was filled with fury and he showed forth all his strength. From Heaven and from [Olympus](../places/olympus.md) he came forthwith, hurling his lightning."[^theog-zeus] The destruction was overwhelming: "All the land seethed, and Ocean's streams and the unfruitful sea. The hot vapour lapped round the earthborn Titans: flame unspeakable rose to the bright upper air."[^theog-fire]

The Hundred-Handers threw "three hundred rocks, one upon another... and overshadowed the Titans with their missiles."[^theog-300]

[^theog-rocks]: "These, then, stood against the Titans in grim strife, holding huge rocks in their strong hands." (Theogony 674-675)
[^theog-scale]: "The boundless sea rang terribly around, and the earth crashed loudly: wide Heaven was shaken and groaned, and high Olympus reeled from its foundation under the charge of the undying gods, and a heavy quaking reached dim Tartarus" (Theogony 678-683)
[^theog-zeus]: "Then Zeus no longer held back his might; but straight his heart was filled with fury and he showed forth all his strength. From Heaven and from Olympus he came forthwith, hurling his lightning" (Theogony 687-692)
[^theog-fire]: "All the land seethed, and Ocean's streams and the unfruitful sea. The hot vapour lapped round the earthborn Titans: flame unspeakable rose to the bright upper air" (Theogony 695-700)
[^theog-300]: "three hundred rocks, one upon another, they launched from their strong hands and overshadowed the Titans with their missiles" (Theogony 713-716)

## Aftermath

The Titans were "buried beneath the wide-pathed earth, and bound in bitter chains." They were imprisoned in [Tartarus](../places/tartarus.md), described as being as far below the earth as heaven is above it — "a brazen anvil falling down from heaven nine nights and days would reach the earth upon the tenth: and again, a brazen anvil falling from earth nine nights and days would reach Tartarus upon the tenth."[^theog-tartarus]

[Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) "fixed gates of bronze upon it, and a wall runs all round it on every side." The [Hundred-Handers](../creatures/hundred-handers.md) — Gyes, Cottus, and Obriareus — became "trusty warders of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) who holds the aegis."[^theog-warders]

[^theog-tartarus]: "and buried them beneath the wide-pathed earth, and bound them in bitter chains when they had conquered them by their strength for all their great spirit, as far beneath the earth to Tartarus. For a brazen anvil falling down from heaven nine nights and days would reach the earth upon the tenth: and again, a brazen anvil falling from earth nine nights and days would reach Tartarus upon the tenth." (Theogony 717-725)
[^theog-warders]: "There Gyes and Cottus and great-souled Obriareus live, trusty warders of Zeus who holds the aegis." (Theogony 734-735)

## In the Bibliotheca

Apollodorus provides a more compressed account of the [Titanomachy](../events/titanomachy.md) that adds several details to the Theogony.

### Metis and the Emetic

[Zeus](../deities/zeus.md), "when full-grown," enlisted Metis, "daughter of Ocean," to help him. She "gave Cronus a drug to swallow, which forced him to disgorge first the stone and then the children whom he had swallowed."[^apd-titan-emetic] The Theogony credits Zeus himself with making Cronos disgorge; Apollodorus introduces Metis as the agent.

### The Ten-Year War and Campe

"They fought for ten years," and [Gaia](../deities/gaia.md) "prophesied victory to Zeus if he should have as allies those who had been hurled down to Tartarus."[^apd-titan-war] Zeus then "slew their jailoress Campe, and loosed their bonds."[^apd-titan-campe] The jailoress Campe is unique to Apollodorus among the sources processed so far.

### The Three Lots

After the victory, "they themselves cast lots for the sovereignty, and to [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) was allotted the dominion of the sky, to [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) the dominion of the sea, and to [Hades](../deities/hades.md) the dominion in Hades."[^apd-titan-lots] The Theogony does not describe a division by lot; it simply states Zeus's supremacy.

[^apd-titan-emetic]: "he took Metis, daughter of Ocean, to help him, and she gave Cronus a drug to swallow, which forced him to disgorge first the stone and then the children whom he had swallowed" (Bibliotheca 1.2.1, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-titan-war]: "They fought for ten years, and Earth prophesied victory to Zeus if he should have as allies those who had been hurled down to Tartarus" (Bibliotheca 1.2.1, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-titan-campe]: "So he slew their jailoress Campe, and loosed their bonds" (Bibliotheca 1.2.1, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-titan-lots]: "they themselves cast lots for the sovereignty, and to Zeus was allotted the dominion of the sky, to Poseidon the dominion of the sea, and to Pluto the dominion in Hades" (Bibliotheca 1.2.1, trans. Frazer)
