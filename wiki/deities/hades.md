## Mythology

[Zeus](zeus.md) gave [Persephone](persephone.md) to Hades: "[Demeter](demeter.md) bare white-armed Persephone whom Aidoneus carried off from her mother; but wise Zeus gave her to him."[^theog-persephone]

During the battle with [Typhoeus](../creatures/typhoeus.md), "Hades trembled where he rules over the dead below."[^theog-typhoeus]

[^theog-typhoeus]: "Hades trembled where he rules over the dead below, and the Titans under Tartarus who live with Cronos, because of the unending clamour and the fearful strife" (Theogony 850-852)

## The Abduction of Persephone (Hymn to Demeter)

In the [Homeric Hymn to Demeter](../sources/homeric-hymns.md), Hades is given [Persephone](persephone.md) "by all-seeing [Zeus](zeus.md) the loud-thunderer." He seized her while she gathered flowers: "the wide-pathed earth yawned there in the plain of Nysa, and the lord, Host of Many, with his immortal horses sprang out upon her."[^hd-seize]

[Helius](helius.md) confirmed to [Demeter](demeter.md) that [Zeus](zeus.md) gave Persephone to Hades, but counselled her: "Aidoneus, the Ruler of Many, is no unfitting husband among the deathless gods for your child, being your own brother and born of the same stock: also, for honour, he has that third share which he received when division was made at the first."[^hd-helius]

When [Hermes](hermes.md) came to retrieve Persephone, "Aidoneus, ruler over the dead, smiled grimly and obeyed the behest of [Zeus](zeus.md) the king." He told Persephone: "while you are here, you shall rule all that lives and moves and shall have the greatest rights among the deathless gods." But "he on his part secretly gave her sweet pomegranate seed to eat, taking care for himself that she might not remain continually with grave, dark-robed [Demeter](demeter.md)."[^hd-pomegranate]

[^hd-seize]: "the wide-pathed earth yawned there in the plain of Nysa, and the lord, Host of Many, with his immortal horses sprang out upon her—the Son of Cronos, He who has many names. He caught her up reluctant on his golden car and bare her away lamenting" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 16-20, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^hd-helius]: "Aidoneus, the Ruler of Many, is no unfitting husband among the deathless gods for your child, being your own brother and born of the same stock: also, for honour, he has that third share which he received when division was made at the first, and is appointed lord of those among whom he dwells" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 83-87)
[^hd-pomegranate]: "Aidoneus, ruler over the dead, smiled grimly and obeyed the behest of Zeus the king... he on his part secretly gave her sweet pomegranate seed to eat, taking care for himself that she might not remain continually with grave, dark-robed Demeter" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 357-374)
