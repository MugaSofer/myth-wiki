[^theog-halls]: "There, in front, stand the echoing halls of the god of the lower-world, strong Hades, and of awful Persephone" (Theogony 767-768)

## Mythology

[Zeus](zeus.md) gave [Persephone](persephone.md) to Hades: "[Demeter](demeter.md) bare white-armed Persephone whom Aidoneus carried off from her mother; but wise Zeus gave her to him."[^theog-persephone]

During the battle with [Typhoeus](../creatures/typhoeus.md), "Hades trembled where he rules over the dead below."[^theog-typhoeus]

[^theog-typhoeus]: "Hades trembled where he rules over the dead below, and the Titans under Tartarus who live with Cronos, because of the unending clamour and the fearful strife" (Theogony 850-852)

## The Abduction of Persephone (Hymn to Demeter)

In the [Homeric Hymn to Demeter](../sources/homeric-hymns.md), Hades is given [Persephone](persephone.md) "by all-seeing [Zeus](zeus.md) the loud-thunderer." He seized her while she gathered flowers: "the wide-pathed earth yawned there in the plain of Nysa, and the lord, Host of Many, with his immortal horses sprang out upon her."[^hd-seize]

[Helius](helius.md) confirmed to [Demeter](demeter.md) that [Zeus](zeus.md) gave Persephone to Hades, but counselled her: "Aidoneus, the Ruler of Many, is no unfitting husband among the deathless gods for your child, being your own brother and born of the same stock: also, for honour, he has that third share which he received when division was made at the first."[^hd-helius]

When [Hermes](hermes.md) came to retrieve Persephone, "Aidoneus, ruler over the dead, smiled grimly and obeyed the behest of [Zeus](zeus.md) the king." He told Persephone: "while you are here, you shall rule all that lives and moves and shall have the greatest rights among the deathless gods." But "he on his part secretly gave her sweet pomegranate seed to eat, taking care for himself that she might not remain continually with grave, dark-robed [Demeter](demeter.md)."[^hd-pomegranate]

[^hd-seize]: "the wide-pathed earth yawned there in the plain of Nysa, and the lord, Host of Many, with his immortal horses sprang out upon her—the Son of Cronos, He who has many names. He caught her up reluctant on his golden car and bare her away lamenting" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 16-20, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^hd-helius]: "Aidoneus, the Ruler of Many, is no unfitting husband among the deathless gods for your child, being your own brother and born of the same stock: also, for honour, he has that third share which he received when division was made at the first, and is appointed lord of those among whom he dwells" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 83-87)
[^hd-pomegranate]: "Aidoneus, ruler over the dead, smiled grimly and obeyed the behest of Zeus the king... he on his part secretly gave her sweet pomegranate seed to eat, taking care for himself that she might not remain continually with grave, dark-robed Demeter" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 357-374)

## In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md)

### Abduction of Proserpina (5.341-424)

The Metamorphoses presents the abduction as orchestrated by [Aphrodite](aphrodite.md) (Venus). Typhoeus's struggles beneath Sicily caused earthquakes, and Hades (Pluto) left his realm to inspect the foundations, fearing the earth might crack open and "letting in the day, may terrify the trembling ghosts."[^met-had-quake] Venus saw him wandering and commanded [Cupid](../heroes/cupid.md) to shoot him: "aim thy keenest arrow at the heart of that divinity whom fortune gave the last award... why, then, should Tartarus escape our sway — the third part of the universe at stake."[^met-had-venus]

Cupid's arrow "struck Pluto in the breast." At Lake Pergus near Henna, while [Persephone](persephone.md) (Proserpine) was gathering lilies and violets, "she was seen, beloved, and carried off by Pluto — such the haste of sudden love." She called for her mother as her gathered flowers fell from her torn robe.[^met-had-seize] The nymph Cyane opposed him: "O thou shalt go no further, Pluto, thou shalt not by force alone become the son-in-law of Ceres." But Hades "blazed with uncontrolled rage; and urged his steeds, and hurled his royal scepter in the pool." The earth opened and "received the plunging chariot in the midst."[^met-had-cyane]

[^met-had-quake]: "that dark despot left his gloomy habitation; carried forth by soot-black horses, in his gloomy car. He circumspectly viewed Sicilia's vast foundations" (Metamorphoses 5.356-362, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-had-venus]: "aim thy keenest arrow at the heart of that divinity whom fortune gave the last award, what time the triple realm, by lot was portioned out... why, then, should Tartarus escape our sway — the third part of the universe at stake" (Metamorphoses 5.365-375)
[^met-had-seize]: "while she heaped her basket, while she filled her bosom, in a pretty zeal to strive beyond all others; she was seen, beloved, and carried off by Pluto — such the haste of sudden love" (Metamorphoses 5.393-396)
[^met-had-cyane]: "The son of Saturn blazed with uncontrolled rage; and urged his steeds, and hurled his royal scepter in the pool. Cast with a mighty arm it pierced the deeps. The smitten earth made way to Tartarus; it opened a wide basin and received the plunging chariot in the midst" (Metamorphoses 5.417-424)
