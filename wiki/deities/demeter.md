When she revealed her true form at Eleusis, "the goddess changed her stature and her looks, thrusting old age away from her: beauty spread round about her and a lovely fragrance was wafted from her sweet-smelling robes, and from the divine body of the goddess a light shone afar, while golden tresses spread down over her shoulders, so that the strong house was filled with brightness as with lightning."[^epithets-reveal]

[^epithets-reveal]: "the goddess changed her stature and her looks, thrusting old age away from her: beauty spread round about her and a lovely fragrance was wafted from her sweet-smelling robes, and from the divine body of the goddess a light shone afar, while golden tresses spread down over her shoulders, so that the strong house was filled with brightness as with lightning" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 275-280)
[^epithets-disguise]: "she was like an ancient woman who is cut off from childbearing and the gifts of garland-loving Aphrodite" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 101-102)

## Children

With [Zeus](zeus.md), Demeter bore "white-armed [Persephone](persephone.md) whom Aidoneus [[Hades](hades.md)] carried off from her mother; but wise [Zeus](zeus.md) gave her to him."[^theog-persephone]

"Demeter, bright goddess, was joined in sweet love with the hero Iasion in a thrice-ploughed fallow in the rich land of Crete, and bare Plutus, a kindly god who goes everywhere over land and the sea's wide back, and him who finds him and into whose hands he comes he makes rich, bestowing great wealth upon him."[^theog-plutus]

[^theog-persephone]: "Also he came to the bed of all-nourishing Demeter, and she bare white-armed Persephone whom Aidoneus carried off from her mother; but wise Zeus gave her to him" (Theogony 912-914, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^theog-plutus]: "Demeter, bright goddess, was joined in sweet love with the hero Iasion in a thrice-ploughed fallow in the rich land of Crete, and bare Plutus, a kindly god who goes everywhere over land and the sea's wide back, and him who finds him and into whose hands he comes he makes rich, bestowing great wealth upon him" (Theogony 969-974)

## The Search for Persephone (Hymn to Demeter)

The [Homeric Hymn to Demeter](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) tells the full story of [Persephone](persephone.md)'s abduction.

### The Abduction

[Persephone](persephone.md) "was playing with the deep-bosomed daughters of [Oceanus](oceanus.md) and gathering flowers over a soft meadow" when [Hades](hades.md) seized her: "the wide-pathed earth yawned there in the plain of Nysa, and the lord, Host of Many, with his immortal horses sprang out upon her." He had been "given" Persephone "by all-seeing [Zeus](zeus.md) the loud-thunderer."[^hd-abduction]

### The Search

"Bitter pain seized her heart" and Demeter "sped, like a wild-bird, over the firm land and yielding sea, seeking her child. But no one would tell her the truth, neither god nor mortal men." For nine days she wandered with flaming torches, "so grieved that she never tasted ambrosia and the sweet draught of nectar." On the tenth day, [Hecate](hecate.md) met her, having "heard her voice" but not seen the abductor.[^hd-search]

[Helius](helius.md) then told Demeter the truth: "None other of the deathless gods is to blame, but only cloud-gathering [Zeus](zeus.md) who gave her to [Hades](hades.md), her father's brother, to be called his buxom wife."[^hd-helius]

### Disguise at Eleusis

Demeter, angered, "avoided the gathering of the gods and high [Olympus](../places/olympus.md), and went to the towns and rich fields of men, disfiguring her form." She came to Eleusis and sat by the Maiden Well, "like an ancient woman who is cut off from childbearing." The daughters of Celeus found her and brought her to their mother Metaneira to nurse her infant son Demophoon.[^hd-eleusis]

### Demophoon

Demeter nursed Demophoon in secret: "by day rich-crowned Demeter would anoint him with ambrosia as if he were the offspring of a god... But at night she would hide him like a brand in the heart of the fire." She "would have made him deathless and unageing" had not Metaneira spied on her and cried out. Demeter in wrath revealed herself: "Lo! I am that Demeter who has share of honour and is the greatest help and cause of joy to the undying gods and mortal men." She commanded them to build her a temple.[^hd-demophoon]

### The Famine

Demeter "sat there apart from all the blessed gods and stayed, wasting with yearning for her deep-bosomed daughter. Then she caused a most dreadful and cruel year for mankind... the ground would not make the seed sprout, for rich-crowned Demeter kept it hid." She "would have destroyed the whole race of man with cruel famine and have robbed them who dwell on [Olympus](../places/olympus.md) of their glorious right of gifts and sacrifices."[^hd-famine]

She "vowed that she would never set foot on fragrant Olympus nor let fruit spring out of the ground, until she beheld with her eyes her own fair-faced daughter."[^hd-vow]

### The Return

[Zeus](zeus.md) sent [Hermes](hermes.md) to [Hades](hades.md), who let [Persephone](persephone.md) go — but secretly gave her pomegranate seed to eat. When Demeter asked whether Persephone had tasted food in the underworld, she explained the terms: "if you have not, you shall come back from loathly [Hades](hades.md) and live with me... but if you have tasted food, you must go back again beneath the secret places of the earth, there to dwell a third part of the seasons every year: yet for the two parts you shall be with me."[^hd-terms]

[Rhea](rhea.md) came as Zeus's messenger to confirm the arrangement. "Rich-crowned Demeter did not refuse but straightway made fruit to spring up from the rich lands, so that the whole wide earth was laden with leaves and flowers."[^hd-return]

### The Eleusinian Mysteries

Demeter then "showed the conduct of her rites and taught them all her mysteries, to Triptolemus and Polyxeinus and Diocles also,—awful mysteries which no one may in any way transgress or pry into or utter, for deep awe of the gods checks the voice. Happy is he among men upon earth who has seen these mysteries."[^hd-mysteries]

[^hd-abduction]: "Apart from Demeter, lady of the golden sword and glorious fruits, she was playing with the deep-bosomed daughters of Oceanus and gathering flowers over a soft meadow... but the wide-pathed earth yawned there in the plain of Nysa, and the lord, Host of Many, with his immortal horses sprang out upon her" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 4-18, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^hd-search]: "Bitter pain seized her heart, and she rent the covering upon her divine hair with her dear hands... she sped, like a wild-bird, over the firm land and yielding sea, seeking her child. But no one would tell her the truth, neither god nor mortal men" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 40-49)
[^hd-helius]: "None other of the deathless gods is to blame, but only cloud-gathering Zeus who gave her to Hades, her father's brother, to be called his buxom wife" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 77-79)
[^hd-eleusis]: "she was so angered with the dark-clouded Son of Cronos that she avoided the gathering of the gods and high Olympus, and went to the towns and rich fields of men, disfiguring her form a long while" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 91-94)
[^hd-demophoon]: "by day rich-crowned Demeter would anoint him with ambrosia as if he were the offspring of a god and breathe sweetly upon him as she held him in her bosom. But at night she would hide him like a brand in the heart of the fire... And she would have made him deathless and unageing" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 235-242)
[^hd-famine]: "she caused a most dreadful and cruel year for mankind over the all-nourishing earth: the ground would not make the seed sprout, for rich-crowned Demeter kept it hid" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 305-309)
[^hd-vow]: "she vowed that she would never set foot on fragrant Olympus nor let fruit spring out of the ground, until she beheld with her eyes her own fair-faced daughter" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 331-333)
[^hd-terms]: "if you have not, you shall come back from loathly Hades and live with me and your father, the dark-clouded Son of Cronos and be honoured by all the deathless gods; but if you have tasted food, you must go back again beneath the secret places of the earth, there to dwell a third part of the seasons every year: yet for the two parts you shall be with me and the other deathless gods" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 393-403)
[^hd-return]: "rich-crowned Demeter did not refuse but straightway made fruit to spring up from the rich lands, so that the whole wide earth was laden with leaves and flowers" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 470-473)
[^hd-mysteries]: "she showed the conduct of her rites and taught them all her mysteries, to Triptolemus and Polyxeinus and Diocles also,—awful mysteries which no one may in any way transgress or pry into or utter, for deep awe of the gods checks the voice. Happy is he among men upon earth who has seen these mysteries" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 473-480)
