## Appearance

During her search for [Persephone](persephone.md), she disguised herself as "an ancient woman who is cut off from childbearing and the gifts of garland-loving Aphrodite."[^epithets-disguise]

When she revealed her true form at Eleusis, "the goddess changed her stature and her looks, thrusting old age away from her: beauty spread round about her and a lovely fragrance was wafted from her sweet-smelling robes, and from the divine body of the goddess a light shone afar, while golden tresses spread down over her shoulders, so that the strong house was filled with brightness as with lightning."[^epithets-reveal]

[^epithets-reveal]: "the goddess changed her stature and her looks, thrusting old age away from her: beauty spread round about her and a lovely fragrance was wafted from her sweet-smelling robes, and from the divine body of the goddess a light shone afar, while golden tresses spread down over her shoulders, so that the strong house was filled with brightness as with lightning" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 275-280)
[^epithets-disguise]: "she was like an ancient woman who is cut off from childbearing and the gifts of garland-loving Aphrodite" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 101-102)

## Children

With [Zeus](zeus.md), Demeter bore "white-armed [Persephone](persephone.md) whom Aidoneus [[Hades](hades.md)] carried off from her mother; but wise [Zeus](zeus.md) gave her to him."[^theog-persephone]

"Demeter, bright goddess, was joined in sweet love with the hero Iasion in a thrice-ploughed fallow in the rich land of Crete, and bare Plutus, a kindly god who goes everywhere over land and the sea's wide back, and him who finds him and into whose hands he comes he makes rich, bestowing great wealth upon him."[^theog-plutus]

[^theog-persephone]: "Also he came to the bed of all-nourishing Demeter, and she bare white-armed Persephone whom Aidoneus carried off from her mother; but wise Zeus gave her to him" (Theogony 912-914, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^theog-plutus]: "Demeter, bright goddess, was joined in sweet love with the hero Iasion in a thrice-ploughed fallow in the rich land of Crete, and bare Plutus, a kindly god who goes everywhere over land and the sea's wide back, and him who finds him and into whose hands he comes he makes rich, bestowing great wealth upon him" (Theogony 969-974)

## The Search for Persephone (Hymn to Demeter)

The [Homeric Hymn to Demeter](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) tells the full story of [Persephone](persephone.md)'s abduction.

### The Abduction

[Persephone](persephone.md) "was playing with the deep-bosomed daughters of [Oceanus](oceanus.md) and gathering flowers over a soft meadow" when [Hades](hades.md) seized her: "the wide-pathed earth yawned there in the plain of Nysa, and the lord, Host of Many, with his immortal horses sprang out upon her." He had been "given" Persephone "by all-seeing [Zeus](zeus.md) the loud-thunderer."[^hd-abduction]

### The Search

"Bitter pain seized her heart" and Demeter "sped, like a wild-bird, over the firm land and yielding sea, seeking her child. But no one would tell her the truth, neither god nor mortal men." For nine days she wandered with flaming torches, "so grieved that she never tasted ambrosia and the sweet draught of nectar." On the tenth day, [Hecate](hecate.md) met her, having "heard her voice" but not seen the abductor.[^hd-search]

[Helius](helius.md) then told Demeter the truth: "None other of the deathless gods is to blame, but only cloud-gathering [Zeus](zeus.md) who gave her to [Hades](hades.md), her father's brother, to be called his buxom wife."[^hd-helius]

### Disguise at Eleusis

Demeter, angered, "avoided the gathering of the gods and high [Olympus](../places/olympus.md), and went to the towns and rich fields of men, disfiguring her form." She came to Eleusis and sat by the Maiden Well, "like an ancient woman who is cut off from childbearing." The daughters of Celeus found her and brought her to their mother Metaneira to nurse her infant son Demophoon.[^hd-eleusis]

### Demophoon

Demeter nursed Demophoon in secret: "by day rich-crowned Demeter would anoint him with ambrosia as if he were the offspring of a god... But at night she would hide him like a brand in the heart of the fire." She "would have made him deathless and unageing" had not Metaneira spied on her and cried out. Demeter in wrath revealed herself: "Lo! I am that Demeter who has share of honour and is the greatest help and cause of joy to the undying gods and mortal men." She commanded them to build her a temple.[^hd-demophoon]

### The Famine

Demeter "sat there apart from all the blessed gods and stayed, wasting with yearning for her deep-bosomed daughter. Then she caused a most dreadful and cruel year for mankind... the ground would not make the seed sprout, for rich-crowned Demeter kept it hid." She "would have destroyed the whole race of man with cruel famine and have robbed them who dwell on [Olympus](../places/olympus.md) of their glorious right of gifts and sacrifices."[^hd-famine]

She "vowed that she would never set foot on fragrant Olympus nor let fruit spring out of the ground, until she beheld with her eyes her own fair-faced daughter."[^hd-vow]

### The Return

[Zeus](zeus.md) sent [Hermes](hermes.md) to [Hades](hades.md), who let [Persephone](persephone.md) go — but secretly gave her pomegranate seed to eat. When Demeter asked whether Persephone had tasted food in the underworld, she explained the terms: "if you have not, you shall come back from loathly [Hades](hades.md) and live with me... but if you have tasted food, you must go back again beneath the secret places of the earth, there to dwell a third part of the seasons every year: yet for the two parts you shall be with me."[^hd-terms]

[Rhea](rhea.md) came as Zeus's messenger to confirm the arrangement. "Rich-crowned Demeter did not refuse but straightway made fruit to spring up from the rich lands, so that the whole wide earth was laden with leaves and flowers."[^hd-return]

### The Eleusinian Mysteries

Demeter then "showed the conduct of her rites and taught them all her mysteries, to Triptolemus and Polyxeinus and Diocles also,—awful mysteries which no one may in any way transgress or pry into or utter, for deep awe of the gods checks the voice. Happy is he among men upon earth who has seen these mysteries."[^hd-mysteries]

[^hd-abduction]: "Apart from Demeter, lady of the golden sword and glorious fruits, she was playing with the deep-bosomed daughters of Oceanus and gathering flowers over a soft meadow... but the wide-pathed earth yawned there in the plain of Nysa, and the lord, Host of Many, with his immortal horses sprang out upon her" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 4-18, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^hd-search]: "Bitter pain seized her heart, and she rent the covering upon her divine hair with her dear hands... she sped, like a wild-bird, over the firm land and yielding sea, seeking her child. But no one would tell her the truth, neither god nor mortal men" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 40-49)
[^hd-helius]: "None other of the deathless gods is to blame, but only cloud-gathering Zeus who gave her to Hades, her father's brother, to be called his buxom wife" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 77-79)
[^hd-eleusis]: "she was so angered with the dark-clouded Son of Cronos that she avoided the gathering of the gods and high Olympus, and went to the towns and rich fields of men, disfiguring her form a long while" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 91-94)
[^hd-demophoon]: "by day rich-crowned Demeter would anoint him with ambrosia as if he were the offspring of a god and breathe sweetly upon him as she held him in her bosom. But at night she would hide him like a brand in the heart of the fire... And she would have made him deathless and unageing" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 235-242)
[^hd-famine]: "she caused a most dreadful and cruel year for mankind over the all-nourishing earth: the ground would not make the seed sprout, for rich-crowned Demeter kept it hid" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 305-309)
[^hd-vow]: "she vowed that she would never set foot on fragrant Olympus nor let fruit spring out of the ground, until she beheld with her eyes her own fair-faced daughter" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 331-333)
[^hd-terms]: "if you have not, you shall come back from loathly Hades and live with me and your father, the dark-clouded Son of Cronos and be honoured by all the deathless gods; but if you have tasted food, you must go back again beneath the secret places of the earth, there to dwell a third part of the seasons every year: yet for the two parts you shall be with me and the other deathless gods" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 393-403)
[^hd-return]: "rich-crowned Demeter did not refuse but straightway made fruit to spring up from the rich lands, so that the whole wide earth was laden with leaves and flowers" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 470-473)
[^hd-mysteries]: "she showed the conduct of her rites and taught them all her mysteries, to Triptolemus and Polyxeinus and Diocles also,—awful mysteries which no one may in any way transgress or pry into or utter, for deep awe of the gods checks the voice. Happy is he among men upon earth who has seen these mysteries" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 473-480)

## In the Fabulae

### Proserpina Seized (§146)

The [Fabulae](../sources/hyginus.md) gives a concise account of [Persephone](persephone.md)'s (Proserpina) abduction. "[Hades](hades.md) (Pluto) asked from [Zeus](zeus.md) (Jove) that he give him in marriage Ceres' [[Demeter](demeter.md)'s] daughter and his own."[^hyg-146-request] Zeus facilitated the abduction rather than give open consent: "Jove said that Ceres would not permit her daughter to live in gloomy Tartarus, but bade him seize her as she was gathering flowers on Mount Etna, which is in Sicily."[^hyg-146-command]

The abduction took place as planned: "While Proserpina was gathering flowers with Venus [[Aphrodite](aphrodite.md)], Diana [[Artemis](artemis.md)], and Minerva [[Athena](athena.md)], Pluto came in his four-horse chariot, and seized her."[^hyg-146-seized]

Zeus later arranged the compromise: "Afterwards Ceres obtained from Jove permission for her to stay half of the year with her, and half with Pluto."[^hyg-146-compromise]

[^hyg-146-request]: "Pluto asked from Jove that he give him in marriage Ceres' daughter and his own." (Fabulae §146, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-146-command]: "Jove said that Ceres would not permit her daughter to live in gloomy Tartarus, but bade him seize her as she was gathering flowers on Mount Etna, which is in Sicily." (Fabulae §146, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-146-seized]: "While Proserpina was gathering flowers with Venus, Diana, and Minerva, Pluto came in his four-horse chariot, and seized her." (Fabulae §146, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-146-compromise]: "Afterwards Ceres obtained from Jove permission for her to stay half of the year with her, and half with Pluto." (Fabulae §146, trans. Mary Grant)

### Triptolemus (§147)

The Fabulae tells the story of Demeter's gift of agriculture. During her search for her daughter, Demeter "came to King Eleusinus, whose wife Cothonea had borne the boy Triptolemus, and pretended she was a wet nurse."[^hyg-147-nurse]

Demeter attempted to make the child immortal: "Since Ceres wanted to make her charge immortal, she fed him by day with divine milk, but by night secretly hid him in the fire."[^hyg-147-immortal] The result was miraculous: "In this way he grew more than mortals are wont to grow."[^hyg-147-growth]

When discovered, the goddess responded with power: "When the parents wondered at it, they watched her. When Ceres was about to put him in the fire, the father was terrified. In her anger, she struck down Eleusinus."[^hyg-147-anger]

The gift to Triptolemus was transformative: "but on Triptolemus, her foster-son, she conferred everlasting honour, for she gave him her chariot yoked with Serpents to spread the cultivation of grain. Riding in it he sowed grain throughout the earth."[^hyg-147-gift] Triptolemus established cult: "He also established sacred rites in honour of Ceres, which are called in Greek Thesmophoria."[^hyg-147-rites]

[^hyg-147-nurse]: "When Ceres was hunting for her daughter, she came to King Eleusinus, whose wife Cothonea had borne the boy Triptolemus, and pretended she was a wet nurse." (Fabulae §147, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-147-immortal]: "Since Ceres wanted to make her charge immortal, she fed him by day with divine milk, but by night secretly hid him in the fire." (Fabulae §147, trans. Mary Grant)

[^hyg-147-rites]: "He also established sacred rites in honour of Ceres, which are called in Greek Thesmophoria." (Fabulae §147, trans. Mary Grant)

## In the Odyssey

### Demeter and Iasion (Book V)

In [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) Book V, Calypso cites Demeter's love for the mortal Iasion as a second precedent for the gods' jealousy: "So too when fair-tressed Demeter yielded to her love, and lay with Iasion in the thrice-ploughed fallow-field, [Zeus](zeus.md) was not long without tidings thereof, and cast at him with his white bolt and slew him."[^od5-iasion]

This echoes the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md)'s account of the same union (969-974), but where the Theogony focuses on the offspring Plutus, Calypso emphasises Zeus's violent punishment of the mortal lover.

[^od5-iasion]: "So too when fair-tressed Demeter yielded to her love, and lay with Iasion in the thrice-ploughed fallow-field, Zeus was not long without tidings thereof, and cast at him with his white bolt and slew him" (Odyssey V.3098-3101, trans. Butcher and Lang)

## In the Bibliotheca

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) retells the search for [Persephone](persephone.md) with several variants from the [Homeric Hymn to Demeter](../sources/homeric-hymns.md).

### The Search

[Hades](hades.md) "fell in love with Persephone and with the help of [Zeus](zeus.md) carried her off secretly." Demeter searched "all over the earth with torches by night and day, and learning from the people of Hermion that Pluto had carried her off, she was wroth with the gods and quitted heaven."[^apd-dem-search]

### At Eleusis

Coming to Eleusis in the likeness of a woman, Demeter "first she sat down on the rock which has been named Laughless after her, beside what is called the Well of the Fair Dances." A crone named Iambe "joked the goddess and made her smile. For that reason they say that the women break jests at the Thesmophoria."[^apd-dem-iambe]

> **VARIANT:** In the Homeric Hymn, the jesting figure is also named Iambe, but the connection to the Thesmophoria festival is made more explicit in the Bibliotheca.

### Demophon

Demeter received Metanira's child to nurse, "wishing to make it immortal she set the babe of nights on the fire and stripped off its mortal flesh." But Praxithea watched, "and discovering him buried in the fire she cried out; wherefore the babe was consumed by the fire and the goddess revealed herself."[^apd-dem-demophon]

> **VARIANT:** In the Homeric Hymn, Metanira herself discovers the child and cries out, and the child Demophoon survives (merely losing his chance at immortality). In the Bibliotheca, the watcher is named Praxithea, and the child Demophon is *consumed by the fire* — a starkly different outcome.

### Triptolemus

"For Triptolemus, the elder of Metanira's children, she made a chariot of winged dragons, and gave him wheat, with which, wafted through the sky, he sowed the whole inhabited earth."[^apd-dem-triptolemus] The text notes variant parentages: "Panyasis affirms that Triptolemus was a son of Eleusis" and "Pherecydes, however, says that he was a son of Ocean and Earth."[^apd-dem-trip-variants]

### The Pomegranate and Ascalaphus

When [Zeus](zeus.md) ordered [Hades](hades.md) to return Persephone, "Pluto gave her a seed of a pomegranate to eat, in order that she might not tarry long with her mother." Ascalaphus, "son of Acheron and Gorgyra, bore witness against her," and "Demeter laid a heavy rock on him in Hades."[^apd-dem-ascalaphus]

### Division of the Year

"Persephone was compelled to remain a third of every year with Pluto and the rest of the time with the gods."[^apd-dem-division]

> **NOTE:** Both the Bibliotheca and the Homeric Hymn agree on the one-third / two-thirds division. This contrasts with a common later tradition of the year split in half.

[^apd-dem-search]: "Demeter went about seeking her all over the earth with torches by night and day, and learning from the people of Hermion that Pluto had carried her off, she was wroth with the gods and quitted heaven" (Bibliotheca 1.5.1, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-dem-iambe]: "first she sat down on the rock which has been named Laughless after her, beside what is called the Well of the Fair Dances... a certain old crone, Iambe, joked the goddess and made her smile. For that reason they say that the women break jests at the Thesmophoria." (Bibliotheca 1.5.1, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-dem-demophon]: "wishing to make it immortal she set the babe of nights on the fire and stripped off its mortal flesh. But as Demophon -- for that was the child's name -- grew marvelously by day, Praxithea watched, and discovering him buried in the fire she cried out; wherefore the babe was consumed by the fire and the goddess revealed herself." (Bibliotheca 1.5.1, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-dem-triptolemus]: "for Triptolemus, the elder of Metanira's children, she made a chariot of winged dragons, and gave him wheat, with which, wafted through the sky, he sowed the whole inhabited earth." (Bibliotheca 1.5.2, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-dem-trip-variants]: "Panyasis affirms that Triptolemus was a son of Eleusis, for he says that Demeter came to him. Pherecydes, however, says that he was a son of Ocean and Earth." (Bibliotheca 1.5.2, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-dem-ascalaphus]: "because Ascalaphus, son of Acheron and Gorgyra, bore witness against her, Demeter laid a heavy rock on him in Hades." (Bibliotheca 1.5.3, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-dem-division]: "Persephone was compelled to remain a third of every year with Pluto and the rest of the time with the gods." (Bibliotheca 1.5.3, trans. Frazer)

## In the Bibliotheca (2.1.3, 2.5.12)

### Called Isis by the Egyptians

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) identifies Demeter with the Egyptian goddess Isis. When Io came to Egypt and married Telegonus, "she set up an image of Demeter, whom the Egyptians called Isis, and Io likewise they called by the name of Isis."[^apd-dem-isis]

### Ascalaphus Turned into an Owl

During [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md)' descent to [Hades](hades.md) for [Cerberus](../creatures/cerberus.md), the text notes: "Demeter turned Ascalaphus into a short-eared owl."[^apd-dem-owl]

> **VARIANT:** In [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) 1.5.3, Demeter punished Ascalaphus by laying "a heavy rock on him in Hades" for testifying that [Persephone](persephone.md) had eaten the pomegranate. Here in 2.5.12, the punishment is transformation into an owl — a different tradition attached to the same figure.

[^apd-dem-isis]: "she set up an image of Demeter, whom the Egyptians called Isis, and Io likewise they called by the name of Isis" (Bibliotheca 2.1.3, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-dem-owl]: "Demeter turned Ascalaphus into a short-eared owl" (Bibliotheca 2.5.12, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-dem-arion]: "Adrastus alone was saved by his horse Arion. That horse Poseidon begot on Demeter, when in the likeness of a Fury she consorted with him" (Bibliotheca 3.6.8, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-dem-iasion]: "Iasion loved Demeter, and in an attempt to defile the goddess he was killed by a thunderbolt" (Bibliotheca 3.12.1, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-dem-eleusis2]: "Demeter was welcomed by Celeus at Eleusis" (Bibliotheca 3.14.7, trans. J.G. Frazer)

## In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md)

### The Search for Proserpina (5.438-508)

Ovid's Calliope sings of Demeter's (Ceres') frantic search for her daughter. After [Hades](hades.md) (Pluto) abducted [Persephone](persephone.md) (Proserpina) near Henna in Sicily, Demeter searched "every land and every sea in vain." She lit two torches from [Aetna](../places/troy.md)'s flames and carried them through the night without rest.[^met-dem-search]

During her wanderings, a thirsty Demeter stopped at a cottage for a drink. A rude boy mocked her, and she sprinkled him with the barley-meal drink, transforming him into a spotted lizard — "a body starred with many coloured spots."[^met-dem-lizard]

### The Blight on Earth (5.462-486)

When the nymph Cyane revealed Proserpina's girdle in her pool, Demeter at last understood what had happened. In her rage, she blighted all of Sicily and then the world: "she broke with savage hand the plows which there had turned the soil, and full of wrath leveled in equal death the peasant and his ox." She made the "fertile isle" a waste — corn was blighted, rain and heat destroyed crops, and weeds choked the wheat.[^met-dem-blight]

### Appeal to Zeus and Resolution (5.509-571)

Demeter appealed to [Zeus](zeus.md) as both mother and father of Proserpina: "If thy hard heart deny a mother grace, yet haply as a father thou canst feel some pity for thy daughter."[^met-dem-plea] Zeus acknowledged the deed was done from love and proposed that Proserpina might return — unless she had eaten in the underworld. But the Fates intervened: Proserpina "had broken fast" by chewing "seven grains, picked from the pallid rind" of a pomegranate.[^met-dem-seeds] Zeus divided the year equally: "for six months with her mother she abides, and six months with her husband."

[^met-dem-search]: "Aurora, when she came with ruddy locks, might never know, nor even Hesperus, if she might deign to rest.—She lit two pines from Aetna's flames and held one in each hand, and restless bore them through the frosty glooms" (Metamorphoses 5.441-445, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-dem-lizard]: "His face grew spotted where the mixture struck, and legs appeared where he had arms before, a tail was added to his changing trunk" (Metamorphoses 5.455-458, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-dem-blight]: "she broke with savage hand the plows which there had turned the soil, and full of wrath leveled in equal death the peasant and his ox" (Metamorphoses 5.477-479, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-dem-plea]: "O Jupiter, a suppliant to thee, both for my own offspring as well as thine" (Metamorphoses 5.514-515, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-dem-seeds]: "The virgin, thoughtless while she strayed among the cultivated Stygian fields, had broken fast. While there she plucked the fruit by bending a pomegranate tree, and plucked, and chewed seven grains, picked from the pallid rind" (Metamorphoses 5.534-538, trans. Brookes More)
