## Overview

**Nemesis** is the personification of righteous indignation — the divine response to excess, transgression, and undeserved good fortune. In Hesiod's [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md), she is a daughter of [Night](night.md), grouped among the dark abstractions of suffering and moral reckoning. In the [Works and Days](../sources/works-and-days.md), she is paired with Aidos (shame/reverence) as one of the last divine qualities to abandon humanity in the Iron Age. A separate tradition in the [Catalogue of Women](../sources/theogony.md) makes her the mother of [Helen](../heroes/helen.md) by [Zeus](zeus.md).

## In the Theogony

Hesiod names Nemesis among the children of [Night](night.md): "also deadly Night bare Nemesis to afflict mortal men, and after her, Deceit and Friendship and hateful Age and hard-hearted Strife."[^theog-birth] Her position in this catalogue — between the [Fates](groups/fates.md) and Erinyes on one side and Strife on the other — places her firmly among Night's brood of moral and punitive forces.

## In the Works and Days

In Hesiod's account of the degeneration of the [Five Ages](../events/five-ages.md), Nemesis and Aidos are the last to abandon humanity: "Aidos and Nemesis, with their sweet forms wrapped in white robes, will go from the wide-pathed earth and forsake mankind to join the company of the deathless gods: and bitter sorrows will be left for mortal men, and there will be no remedy against evil."[^wd-departure]

Hesiod's gloss explains the pairing: "Aidos, as a quality, is that feeling of reverence or shame which restrains men from wrong: Nemesis is the feeling of righteous indignation aroused especially by the sight of the wicked in undeserved prosperity."[^wd-gloss]

## In the Catalogue of Women

The Hesiodic [Catalogue of Women](../sources/theogony.md) gives Nemesis a dramatic mythological role as the mother of [Helen](../heroes/helen.md). "Rich-tressed Nemesis once gave her birth when she had been joined in love with Zeus the king of the gods by harsh violence. For Nemesis tried to escape him and liked not to lie in love with her father Zeus the Son of Cronos; for shame and indignation vexed her heart: therefore she fled him over the land and fruitless dark water."[^cat-flight]

[Zeus](zeus.md) pursued relentlessly: "she took the form of a fish and sped over the waves of the loud-roaring sea, and now over Ocean's stream and the furthest bounds of Earth, and now she sped over the furrowed land, always turning into such dread creatures as the dry land nurtures, that she might escape him."[^cat-forms] Despite her transformations, Zeus caught her.

## In the Bibliotheca

[Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) preserves the same tradition as a variant for Helen's parentage: "some say that Helen was a daughter of Nemesis and Zeus; for that she, flying from the arms of Zeus, changed herself into a goose, but Zeus in his turn took the likeness of a swan and so enjoyed her; and as the fruit of their loves she laid an egg, and a certain shepherd found it in the groves and brought and gave it to [Leda](../heroes/leda.md); and she put it in a chest and kept it; and when Helen was hatched in due time, Leda brought her up as her own daughter."[^apd-egg]

This version specifies the final forms — goose and swan — and explains how [Leda](../heroes/leda.md) became Helen's foster mother.

## In the Fabulae

[Hyginus](../sources/hyginus.md) lists Nemesis among the children of Night and [Erebus](erebus.md): "From Night and Erebus: Fate, Old Age, Death, Dissolution, Continence, Sleep, Dreams, Love... Nemesis, Euphrosyne, Friendship, Compassion, Styx."[^hyg-birth]

## Variant Traditions

Nemesis's parentage differs slightly between sources. Hesiod makes her a daughter of Night alone; Hyginus makes her a daughter of both Night and [Erebus](erebus.md).

The Catalogue of Women fragment gives the fullest account of her flight from Zeus — shape-shifting through fish and "dread creatures" — but does not specify the final forms. Apollodorus fills in the detail: goose and swan. A third version, attributed to Hesiod by a scholiast, makes Helen "the child neither of Leda nor Nemesis, but daughter of Ocean and Zeus."[^hes-ocean]
