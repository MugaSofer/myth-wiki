## Overview

The **Horae** (Hours) are three goddesses of order and justice, daughters of [Zeus](zeus.md) and [Themis](themis.md).

## Birth

"[Zeus](zeus.md) married bright [Themis](themis.md) who bare the Horae (Hours), and Eunomia (Order), Dike (Justice), and blooming Eirene (Peace), who mind the works of mortal men."[^theog-birth]

[^theog-birth]: "Next he married bright Themis who bare the Horae (Hours), and Eunomia (Order), Dike (Justice), and blooming Eirene (Peace), who mind the works of mortal men" (Theogony 901-903, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Members

- **Eunomia** (Order)
- **Dike** (Justice) — see below
- **Eirene** (Peace)

They "mind the works of mortal men."

## Dike (Justice) in Works and Days

In [Works and Days](../sources/works-and-days.md), Dike receives an expanded role as a personified figure. She is "virgin Justice, the daughter of [Zeus](zeus.md), who is honoured and reverenced among the gods who dwell on [Olympus](../places/olympus.md), and whenever anyone hurts her with lying slander, she sits beside her father, Zeus the son of [Cronos](cronos.md), and tells him of men's wicked heart."[^wd-justice]

She is also depicted being physically dragged through the streets: "There is a noise when Justice is being dragged in the way where those who devour bribes and give sentence with crooked judgements, take her. And she, wrapped in mist, follows to the city and haunts of the people, weeping, and bringing mischief to men."[^wd-dragged]

[^wd-justice]: "And there is virgin Justice, the daughter of Zeus, who is honoured and reverenced among the gods who dwell on Olympus, and whenever anyone hurts her with lying slander, she sits beside her father, Zeus the son of Cronos, and tells him of men's wicked heart" (Works and Days 256-260, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^wd-dragged]: "There is a noise when Justice is being dragged in the way where those who devour bribes and give sentence with crooked judgements, take her. And she, wrapped in mist, follows to the city and haunts of the people, weeping, and bringing mischief to men" (Works and Days 220-224)

## In the Hymn to Aphrodite (Hymn VI)

The Horae (as "the rich-haired Hours") also play a role at [Aphrodite](aphrodite.md)'s birth, welcoming and adorning her after she rose from the sea.[^hh6-hours]

[^hh6-hours]: "the gold-filleted Hours welcomed her joyously. They clothed her with heavenly garments" (Homeric Hymn VI to Aphrodite 5-7, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
