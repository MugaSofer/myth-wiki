## Overview

**Uranus** (Heaven) was the first-born child of [Gaia](gaia.md), brought forth "equal to herself, to cover her on every side, and to be an ever-sure abiding-place for the blessed gods."[^theog-born] He became Gaia's consort and father of the [Titans](groups/titans.md), [Cyclopes](../creatures/cyclopes.md), and [Hundred-Handers](../creatures/hundred-handers.md).

[^theog-born]: "Earth first bare starry Heaven, equal to herself, to cover her on every side, and to be an ever-sure abiding-place for the blessed gods" (Theogony 126-128, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Mythology

### Imprisonment of His Children

Uranus "used to hide them all away in a secret place of Earth so soon as each was born, and would not suffer them to come up into the light: and Heaven rejoiced in his evil doing."[^theog-imprison] This provoked [Gaia](gaia.md) to plot his overthrow.

[^theog-imprison]: "he used to hide them all away in a secret place of Earth so soon as each was born, and would not suffer them to come up into the light: and Heaven rejoiced in his evil doing" (Theogony 156-159)

### The Plot

[Gaia](gaia.md), "straitened" by the imprisonment, fashioned a sickle of grey flint and urged her children to act. Only [Cronos](cronos.md) volunteered, saying: "Mother, I will undertake to do this deed, for I reverence not our father of evil name, for he first thought of doing shameful things."[^theog-cronos]

[^theog-cronos]: "'Mother, I will undertake to do this deed, for I reverence not our father of evil name, for he first thought of doing shameful things'" (Theogony 168-172)
