## Overview

**Proteus** was a prophetic sea god who dwelt in Egypt, called "the ancient one of the sea, whose speech is sooth."[^od-ancient] He is the archetypal shape-shifter of Greek mythology — his ability to transform into any form made his name synonymous with changeability. In the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md), [Menelaus](../heroes/menelaus.md) must seize and hold him through his transformations to extract prophecy. [Ovid](../sources/metamorphoses.md) lists his forms as the fullest catalogue of any shape-shifter, and even uses the phrase "the power of Proteus" to describe the ability in others.[^met-mestra]

A separate tradition, found in [Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md), presents a **Proteus, king of Egypt** who receives [Dionysus](dionysus.md) and guards [Helen](../heroes/helen.md) during the [Trojan War](../events/trojan-war.md). Whether this is the same figure as the sea god is left ambiguous by the sources — [Homer](../sources/odyssey.md) himself calls his Proteus "the deathless Egyptian Proteus."[^od-egyptian]

## Epithets

Homer calls Proteus "the ancient one of the sea, whose speech is sooth" (*halios geron*),[^od-ancient] "the deathless Egyptian Proteus,"[^od-egyptian] and "that ancient one of the magic arts."[^od-magic] Eidothee describes him as one "who knows the depths of every sea, and is the thrall of [Poseidon](poseidon.md)."[^od-thrall]

[Ovid](../sources/metamorphoses.md) calls him "Proteus, dweller of the deep — the deep whose arms embrace the earth,"[^met-dweller] and later "the prophet of Carpathia."[^met-carpathian]

## Powers

### Shape-Shifting

Proteus's transformations are described more extensively than those of any other figure. When [Menelaus](../heroes/menelaus.md) and his companions seized him, "at the first he turned into a bearded lion, and thereafter into a snake, and a pard, and a huge boar; then he took the shape of running water, and of a tall and flowering tree."[^od-forms] Eidothee had warned that "he will make assay, and take all manner of shapes of things that creep upon the earth, of water likewise, and of fierce fire burning."[^od-warning]

Ovid gives an even broader catalogue: "some have seen you as a youth, then as a lion, a furious boar one time, a serpent next, so dreadful to the touch — and sometimes horns have made you seem a bull — or now a stone, or now a tree, or now a slipping stream, or even — the foe of water — next a fire."[^met-forms] This list includes forms not found in Homer — youth, bull, stone, and fire.

The transformations follow a consistent pattern: Proteus shifts through forms when seized, but eventually tires and reverts. Eidothee instructs Menelaus to "grasp him steadfastly and press him yet the more, and at length when he questions thee in his proper shape, as he was when first ye saw him laid to rest, then, hero, hold thy strong hands, and let the ancient one go free."[^od-instruction]

### Prophecy

Proteus knows "the depths of every sea"[^od-thrall] and can reveal both past and future. He told Menelaus which of the gods was angry, the fates of the returning Greeks — the deaths of [Ajax](../heroes/ajax.md) and [Agamemnon](../heroes/agamemnon.md) — and that [Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md) was alive on [Calypso](calypso.md)'s island.[^od-odysseus] He also prophesied Menelaus's destiny: "thou, Menelaus, son of Zeus, art not ordained to die and meet thy fate in Argos, the pasture-land of horses, but the deathless gods will convey thee to the [Elysian plain](../places/elysium.md)."[^od-elysium]

In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md), Proteus prophesied to [Thetis](thetis.md) that she would "be the mother of a youth who by heroic actions will surpass the deeds of his own father." It was this prophecy that caused [Zeus](zeus.md) to renounce his desire for her and urge [Peleus](../heroes/peleus.md) to marry her instead.[^met-thetis] He also advised Peleus on how to capture Thetis: "when she at rest lies sleeping in the cool wave, you must bind her while she is unwary, with strong cords and complicated bonds, and never let her arts deceive you when she imitates a hundred varied forms, but hold her fast, whatever she may seem, until she shall at length assume the shape she had at first."[^met-peleus-advice]

## In the Odyssey

### Menelaus's Account

The fullest account of Proteus comes from [Menelaus](../heroes/menelaus.md)'s narration to [Telemachus](../heroes/telemachus.md) in [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) Book 4. Menelaus was stranded on the island of Pharos, off Egypt, for twenty days without wind: "the gods held me twenty days, nor did the sea-winds ever show their breath."[^od-stranded]

Eidothee, "daughter of mighty Proteus, the ancient one of the sea,"[^od-eidothee] took pity on Menelaus and revealed how to capture her father. She explained his daily routine: "so often as the sun in his course stands high in mid heaven, then forth from the brine comes the ancient one of the sea... And when he is got forth, he lies down to sleep in the hollow of the caves. And around him the seals, the brood of the fair daughter of the brine, sleep all in a flock, stolen forth from the grey sea water, and bitter is the scent they breathe of the deeps of the salt sea."[^od-routine]

Eidothee brought "the skins of four sea-calves, and all were newly flayed, for she was minded to lay a snare for her father." She disguised Menelaus and three companions among the seals, using ambrosia to mask the stench: "she took ambrosia of a very sweet savour, and set it beneath each man's nostril, and did away with the stench of the beast."[^od-ambush]

When Proteus emerged to count his seals — "first among the sea-beasts he reckoned us, and guessed not that there was guile" — they rushed and seized him.[^od-seize] He shifted through his forms but eventually yielded: "when now that ancient one of the magic arts was aweary, then at last he questioned me."[^od-yield] Proteus told Menelaus he should have sacrificed to [Zeus](zeus.md) before departing, then revealed the fates of the Greeks and Menelaus's own destiny at the [Elysian plain](../places/elysium.md).

## In the Metamorphoses

Ovid mentions Proteus twice. In Book 8, the river-god Achelous invokes him as the supreme example of the shape-shifting gift: "there are some who take on many shapes, as you have, Proteus, dweller of the deep."[^met-dweller] Ovid then notes that [Mestra](../heroes/mestra.md), daughter of Erysichthon, "had that power of Proteus."[^met-mestra]

In Book 11, Proteus appears as a character. Described as "the prophet of Carpathia," he prophesied to [Thetis](thetis.md) that her son would surpass his father, causing [Zeus](zeus.md) to give her up to [Peleus](../heroes/peleus.md).[^met-thetis] He then advised Peleus on how to capture the shape-shifting Thetis by seizing her in her sleep and holding fast through her transformations. "So Proteus cautioned him, and hid his face beneath the waves as his last words were said."[^met-peleus-end]

## In the Bibliotheca

[Apollodorus](../sources/apollodorus.md) mentions a **Proteus, king of Egypt** in several contexts, apparently distinct from the sea god though sharing the Egyptian connection.

### As Host to Dionysus

When [Dionysus](dionysus.md) was "driven mad by [Hera](hera.md)" and wandered through Egypt and Syria, "at first he was received by Proteus, king of Egypt."[^apd-dionysus]

### As Guardian of Helen

In one tradition about the [Trojan War](../events/trojan-war.md), "[Hermes](hermes.md), in obedience to the will of Zeus, stole Helen and carried her to Egypt, and gave her to Proteus, king of the Egyptians, to guard, and that Alexander repaired to Troy with a phantom of Helen fashioned out of clouds."[^apd-helen-phantom] After the war, "according to some, he discovered Helen at the court of Proteus, king of Egypt; for till then Menelaus had only a phantom of her made of clouds."[^apd-helen-found]

### Sons of Proteus

Apollodorus also records that [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md), travelling to Torone, was "challenged to wrestle by Polygonus and Telegonus, sons of Proteus, son of [Poseidon](poseidon.md), he killed them in the wrestling match."[^apd-sons] This makes Proteus a son of Poseidon — consistent with Homer's description of the sea-Proteus as "the thrall of Poseidon."

## In the Fabulae

[Hyginus](../sources/hyginus.md) gives Proteus his own chapter (§118), describing him as "the prophetic Old Man of the Sea" who dwelt in Egypt and "used to change himself into all sorts of shapes."[^hyg-proteus] By his daughter Idothea's advice, [Menelaus](../heroes/menelaus.md) "bound him with a chain, so that he would tell him when he would reach home." Proteus told him "the gods were angry because Troy had been taken, and on that account an offering should be made which the Greeks call hekatombe, a hundred animals being slain."[^hyg-hekatombe]

Hyginus also lists "Theoclymenus, son of Proteus" among the augurs of myth.[^hyg-augur]

## Variant Traditions

The sources present two overlapping Proteus figures:

**The sea god:** In Homer, Proteus is "the deathless Egyptian Proteus" who herds seals on Pharos, shifts shape, and speaks prophecy. He is "the thrall of Poseidon." Ovid places him at Carpathia and makes him a counsellor of gods. Hyginus calls him "the prophetic Old Man of the Sea" who dwelt in Egypt.

**The king of Egypt:** In Apollodorus, Proteus is "king of the Egyptians" who receives Dionysus and guards Helen — presented in plainly human, political terms with no mention of shape-shifting or prophecy.

Homer's calling the sea god "Egyptian" bridges the two traditions. Apollodorus's description of a "Proteus, son of Poseidon" whose sons wrestled Heracles at Torone may represent yet another figure, or an attempt to connect the sea god's parentage to his master.

Hyginus §170 lists a **Proteus, son of Egyptus** — one of the fifty sons of Aegyptus killed by the Danaids — an entirely separate figure sharing only the name.[^hyg-danaid]
