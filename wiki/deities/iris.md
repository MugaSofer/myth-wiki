## Overview

**Iris** is a swift messenger goddess, daughter of Thaumas and the Oceanid Electra, and sister of the [Harpies](../creatures/harpies.md).

## Epithets & Description

- **"swift Iris"** / **"swift-footed Iris"** — her defining attribute ([Theogony](../sources/theogony.md) 266, 780)
- **"golden-winged Iris"** — used in the [Hymn to Demeter](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) (314)[^desc-golden]

She is consistently associated with speed: she "sped with swift feet across the space between" when delivering [Zeus](zeus.md)'s message.[^desc-swift]

[^desc-golden]: "First he sent golden-winged Iris to call rich-haired Demeter" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 314, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^desc-swift]: "she obeyed the dark-clouded Son of Cronos, and sped with swift feet across the space between" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 317-318)

## Birth

"Thaumas wedded Electra the daughter of deep-flowing Ocean, and she bare him swift Iris and the long-haired [Harpies](../creatures/harpies.md)."[^theog-birth]

[^theog-birth]: "Thaumas wedded Electra the daughter of deep-flowing Ocean, and she bare him swift Iris and the long-haired Harpies" (Theogony 265-267, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Role

In the description of [Tartarus](../places/tartarus.md), Iris serves as [Zeus](zeus.md)'s envoy: "when strife and quarrel arise among the deathless gods, and when any of them who live in the house of [Olympus](../places/olympus.md) lies, then [Zeus](zeus.md) sends Iris to bring in a golden jug the great oath of the gods from far away." She is described as "the daughter of Thaumas, swift-footed Iris," who rarely comes to [Styx](styx.md) "with a message over the sea's wide back."[^theog-oath]

[^theog-oath]: "when strife and quarrel arise among the deathless gods, and when any of them who live in the house of Olympus lies, then Zeus sends Iris to bring in a golden jug the great oath of the gods from far away, the famous cold water which trickles down from a high and beetling rock" ... "Rarely does the daughter of Thaumas, swift-footed Iris, come to her with a message over the sea's wide back" (Theogony 782-785, 780-781)

## In the Hymn to Demeter

[Zeus](zeus.md) first sent Iris to recall [Demeter](demeter.md) from her self-imposed exile at Eleusis: "he sent golden-winged Iris to call rich-haired Demeter, lovely in form." Iris delivered the message but "Demeter's heart was not moved."[^hd-iris]

[^hd-iris]: "First he sent golden-winged Iris to call rich-haired Demeter, lovely in form. So he commanded. And she obeyed the dark-clouded Son of Cronos, and sped with swift feet across the space between" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 314-318, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## In the Iliad

### Messenger to the Trojans (Book II)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book II, [Zeus](zeus.md) sends "fleet Iris the wind-footed" to warn the Trojans of the Greek advance. She disguises herself as Polites son of Priam, taking on the form of a mortal — "she made her voice like to the voice of Polites." She warns Hector to marshal the allies. "Hector failed not to know the voice of the goddess, and straightway dismissed the assembly."[^il2-iris]

[^il2-iris]: "fleet Iris the wind-footed went to the Trojans, a messenger from aegis-bearing Zeus, with a grievous message... she made her voice like to the voice of Polites son of Priam... Hector failed not to know the voice of the goddess, and straightway dismissed the assembly, and they rushed to arms" (Iliad II.1512-1533, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

### Stopping Hera and Athena (Book VIII)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book VIII, [Zeus](zeus.md) sends Iris to intercept [Hera](hera.md) and [Athena](athena.md) as they ride through heaven's gates to join the battle. Iris meets them "even at the entrance of the gates of Olympus many-folded" and delivers Zeus's threats. She calls Athena "most fell art thou, reckless vixen! if thou indeed wilt dare to lift thy huge spear against the face of Zeus."[^il8-vixen] The goddesses obey and turn back.

Here Iris is called "whirlwind-footed" and "fleet-footed" — variant epithets that emphasize her speed.[^il8-speed]

[^il8-vixen]: "Most fell art thou, reckless vixen! if thou indeed wilt dare to lift thy huge spear against the face of Zeus" (Iliad VIII.4813-4815, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il8-speed]: "whirlwind-footed Iris arose to bear the message" (Iliad VIII.4801)

### Tactical Instructions to Hector (Book XI)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book XI, [Zeus](zeus.md) sends "Iris of the golden wings" — a new epithet — to Hector with precise battle instructions. "Wind-footed swift Iris" delivers the message faithfully: hold back while Agamemnon rages, then Zeus "will give thee strength to slay."[^il11-hector]

[^il11-hector]: "Then sent he forth Iris of the golden wings, to bear his word: 'Up and go, swift Iris, and tell this word unto Hector'... So spake he, and wind-footed swift Iris disobeyed him not, but she went down from the hills of Ida to sacred Ilios" (Iliad XI.6332-6343, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
