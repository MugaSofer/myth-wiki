## Overview

**Iris** is a swift messenger goddess, daughter of Thaumas and the Oceanid Electra, and sister of the [Harpies](../creatures/harpies.md).

## Epithets & Description

- **"swift Iris"** / **"swift-footed Iris"** — her defining attribute ([Theogony](../sources/theogony.md) 266, 780)
- **"golden-winged Iris"** — used in the [Hymn to Demeter](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) (314)[^desc-golden]

She is consistently associated with speed: she "sped with swift feet across the space between" when delivering [Zeus](zeus.md)'s message.[^desc-swift]

[^desc-golden]: "First he sent golden-winged Iris to call rich-haired Demeter" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 314, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^desc-swift]: "she obeyed the dark-clouded Son of Cronos, and sped with swift feet across the space between" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 317-318)

## Birth

"Thaumas wedded Electra the daughter of deep-flowing Ocean, and she bare him swift Iris and the long-haired [Harpies](../creatures/harpies.md)."[^theog-birth]

[^theog-birth]: "Thaumas wedded Electra the daughter of deep-flowing Ocean, and she bare him swift Iris and the long-haired Harpies" (Theogony 265-267, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Role

In the description of [Tartarus](../places/tartarus.md), Iris serves as [Zeus](zeus.md)'s envoy: "when strife and quarrel arise among the deathless gods, and when any of them who live in the house of [Olympus](../places/olympus.md) lies, then [Zeus](zeus.md) sends Iris to bring in a golden jug the great oath of the gods from far away." She is described as "the daughter of Thaumas, swift-footed Iris," who rarely comes to [Styx](styx.md) "with a message over the sea's wide back."[^theog-oath]

[^theog-oath]: "when strife and quarrel arise among the deathless gods, and when any of them who live in the house of Olympus lies, then Zeus sends Iris to bring in a golden jug the great oath of the gods from far away, the famous cold water which trickles down from a high and beetling rock" ... "Rarely does the daughter of Thaumas, swift-footed Iris, come to her with a message over the sea's wide back" (Theogony 782-785, 780-781)

## In the Hymn to Demeter

[Zeus](zeus.md) first sent Iris to recall [Demeter](demeter.md) from her self-imposed exile at Eleusis: "he sent golden-winged Iris to call rich-haired Demeter, lovely in form." Iris delivered the message but "Demeter's heart was not moved."[^hd-iris]

[^hd-iris]: "First he sent golden-winged Iris to call rich-haired Demeter, lovely in form. So he commanded. And she obeyed the dark-clouded Son of Cronos, and sped with swift feet across the space between" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 314-318, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
