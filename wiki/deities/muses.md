## Overview

The **Muses** are nine goddesses of song and artistic inspiration, daughters of [Zeus](zeus.md) and [Mnemosyne](mnemosyne.md) (Memory). They are prominently featured in the invocation of Hesiod's [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md), where they inspire the poet and are described as singing the deeds of gods and men.

## Members

The nine Muses, "all of one mind, whose hearts are set upon song," are:[^theog-names]

1. **Cleio** (Clio)
2. **Euterpe**
3. **Thaleia** (Thalia)
4. **Melpomene**
5. **Terpsichore**
6. **Erato**

[^theog-names]: "nine daughters begotten by great Zeus, Cleio and Euterpe, Thaleia, Melpomene and Terpsichore, and Erato and Polyhymnia and Urania and Calliope" (Theogony 76-79, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^theog-calliope]: "the chiefest of them all, for she attends on worshipful princes" (Theogony 79-80)

## Birth

[Mnemosyne](mnemosyne.md), "who reigns over the hills of Eleuther," bore the Muses after [Zeus](zeus.md) lay with her for nine nights, "entering her holy bed remote from the immortals."[^theog-birth] After a year passed, she bore nine daughters "a little way from the topmost peak of snowy [Olympus](../places/olympus.md)."[^theog-birth2]

[^theog-birth]: "Them in Pieria did Mnemosyne (Memory), who reigns over the hills of Eleuther, bear of union with the father, the son of Cronos, a forgetting of ills and a rest from sorrow. For nine nights did wise Zeus lie with her, entering her holy bed remote from the immortals" (Theogony 53-57)
[^theog-birth2]: "she bare nine daughters, all of one mind, whose hearts are set upon song and their spirit free from care, a little way from the topmost peak of snowy Olympus" (Theogony 60-62)

## Description & Activities

The Muses dwell on [Mount Helicon](../places/helicon.md), where they "dance on soft feet about the deep-blue spring and the altar of the almighty son of [Cronos](cronos.md)."[^theog-helicon] They bathe in the springs of Permessus, the Horse's Spring, or Olmeius.[^theog-springs] They also "arise and go abroad by night, veiled in thick mist, and utter their song with lovely voice."[^theog-night]

Their singing voice is described as "lily-like," gladdening the house of Zeus, making "the peaks of snowy [Olympus](../places/olympus.md) resound."[^theog-voice]

Beside them "the [Graces](graces.md) and Himerus (Desire) live in delight."[^theog-graces]

[^theog-helicon]: "dance on soft feet about the deep-blue spring and the altar of the almighty son of Cronos" (Theogony 3-4)
[^theog-springs]: "when they have washed their tender bodies in Permessus or in the Horse's Spring or Olmeius" (Theogony 5-6)
[^theog-night]: "Thence they arise and go abroad by night, veiled in thick mist, and utter their song with lovely voice" (Theogony 9-10)
[^theog-voice]: "the house of their father Zeus the loud-thunderer is glad at the lily-like voice of the goddesses as it spread abroad, and the peaks of snowy Olympus resound" (Theogony 42-44)
[^theog-graces]: "beside them the Graces and Himerus (Desire) live in delight" (Theogony 64)

## Domains & Powers

The Muses sing of "things that are and that shall be and that were aforetime."[^theog-sing] They inspired Hesiod while he was "shepherding his lambs under holy [Helicon](../places/helicon.md)," giving him "a rod, a shoot of sturdy laurel" and breathing "into me a divine voice."[^theog-hesiod]

They bestow gifts on princes and singers: through the Muses, a prince "speaking surely, would soon make wise end even of a great quarrel," and a singer can make a man forget "his heaviness" and sorrows.[^theog-gifts]

It is "through the Muses and far-shooting [Apollo](apollo.md) that there are singers and harpers upon the earth; but princes are of [Zeus](zeus.md)."[^theog-apollo]

[^theog-sing]: "telling of things that are and that shall be and that were aforetime with consenting voice" (Theogony 38)
[^theog-hesiod]: "And one day they taught Hesiod glorious song while he was shepherding his lambs under holy Helicon... and they plucked and gave me a rod, a shoot of sturdy laurel, a marvellous thing, and breathed into me a divine voice to celebrate things that shall be and things there were aforetime" (Theogony 22-32)
[^theog-gifts]: "he, speaking surely, would soon make wise end even of a great quarrel... yet, when a singer, the servant of the Muses, chants the glorious deeds of men of old and the blessed gods who inhabit Olympus, at once he forgets his heaviness and remembers not his sorrows at all" (Theogony 89-103)
[^theog-apollo]: "For it is through the Muses and far-shooting Apollo that there are singers and harpers upon the earth; but princes are of Zeus" (Theogony 94-96)

## In the Iliad

### The Muses and Thamyris (Book II)

In the Catalogue of Ships, the poet notes that near Dorion "the Muses met Thamyris the Thracian, and made an end of his singing, as he was faring from Oichalia, from Eurytos the Oichalian; for he averred with boasting that he would conquer, even did the Muses themselves sing against him, the daughters of aegis-bearing [Zeus](zeus.md); but they in their anger maimed him, moreover they took from him the high gift of song and made him to forget his harping."[^il2-thamyris]

### Invocation for the Catalogue (Book II)

The poet invokes the Muses before the Catalogue of Ships, acknowledging their unique knowledge: "Tell me now, ye Muses that dwell in the mansions of [Olympus](../places/olympus.md)—seeing that ye are goddesses and are at hand and know all things, but we hear only a rumour and know not anything."[^il2-invocation]

[^il2-thamyris]: "the Muses met Thamyris the Thracian, and made an end of his singing, as he was faring from Oichalia, from Eurytos the Oichalian; for he averred with boasting that he would conquer, even did the Muses themselves sing against him, the daughters of aegis-bearing Zeus; but they in their anger maimed him, moreover they took from him the high gift of song and made him to forget his harping" (Iliad 2.576-581, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il2-invocation]: "Tell me now, ye Muses that dwell in the mansions of Olympus—seeing that ye are goddesses and are at hand and know all things, but we hear only a rumour and know not anything" (Iliad 2.469-471)

## In the Bibliotheca

Apollodorus names the nine [Muses](muses.md) in a different order from the Theogony, with Calliope listed first: "by Memory (Mnemosyne) he had the Muses, first Calliope, then Clio, Melpomene, Euterpe, Erato, Terpsichore, Urania, Thalia, and Polymnia."[^apd-muses-list] Their parentage ([Zeus](zeus.md) and [Mnemosyne](mnemosyne.md)) is the same as in the Theogony, and [Persephone](persephone.md) is listed as child of [Zeus](zeus.md) and [Styx](styx.md) rather than Zeus and [Demeter](demeter.md) (see [Persephone - Variant Traditions](persephone.md)).

### Calliope's Sons: Linus and Orpheus

Calliope bore to Oeagrus, "or, nominally, to [Apollo](apollo.md), a son Linus, whom [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) slew; and another son, Orpheus, who practised minstrelsy and by his songs moved stones and trees."[^apd-orpheus]

Orpheus married Eurydice, who "died, bitten by a snake." He descended to [Hades](hades.md) to retrieve her, and [Hades](hades.md) "promised to do so, if on the way Orpheus would not turn round until he should be come to his own house. But he disobeyed and turning round beheld his wife; so she turned back."[^apd-eurydice] Apollodorus also records that "Orpheus also invented the mysteries of [Dionysus](dionysus.md), and having been torn in pieces by the Maenads he is buried in Pieria."[^apd-orpheus-death]

### Clio, Hyacinth, and Thamyris

"Clio fell in love with Pierus, son of Magnes, in consequence of the wrath of [Aphrodite](aphrodite.md), whom she had twitted with her love of Adonis."[^apd-clio] She bore him a son Hyacinth, "for whom Thamyris, the son of Philammon and a nymph Argiope, conceived a passion, he being the first to become enamored of males."[^apd-thamyris] [Apollo](apollo.md) also loved Hyacinth "and killed him involuntarily by the cast of a quoit."[^apd-hyacinth]

Thamyris "engaged in a musical contest with the Muses, the agreement being that, if he won, he should enjoy them all, but that if he should be vanquished he should be bereft of what they would. So the Muses got the better of him and bereft him both of his eyes and of his minstrelsy."[^apd-thamyris-contest] The [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) tells the same story more briefly (II.1331-1336); Apollodorus adds the specific terms of the wager and names Thamyris as "the first to become enamored of males."

### Other Muses' Children

- [Euterpe](muses.md) had by the river Strymon a son Rhesus, "whom Diomedes slew at Troy; but some say his mother was Calliope."[^apd-rhesus]

[^apd-eurydice]: "when his wife Eurydice died, bitten by a snake, he went down to Hades, being fain to bring her up, and he persuaded Pluto to send her up.

But he disobeyed and turning round beheld his wife; so she turned back" (Bibliotheca 1.3.2, trans. Frazer)
