## Overview

**Prometheus** is a son of the [Titan](titans.md) [Iapetus](iapetus.md), described as "clever... full of various wiles."[^theog-clever] He is central to two foundational myths: the trick at Mecone (which established the practice of sacrifice) and the theft of fire.

[^theog-clever]: "clever Prometheus, full of various wiles" (Theogony 510-511)

## Mythology

### The Trick at Mecone

"When the gods and mortal men had a dispute at Mecone," Prometheus slaughtered an ox and divided it into two deceptive portions: he "set flesh and inner parts thick with fat upon the hide, covering them with an ox paunch" (the good portion, disguised to look unappetizing), while "for [Zeus](zeus.md) he put the white bones dressed up with cunning art and covered with shining fat" (the worthless portion, disguised to look good).[^theog-trick]

Zeus rebuked him — "how unfairly you have divided the portions!" — and Prometheus, "smiling softly and not forgetting his cunning trick," invited Zeus to choose.[^theog-choose] Zeus "saw and failed not to perceive the trick, and in his heart he thought mischief against mortal men which also was to be fulfilled." He chose the bones anyway, and "wrath came to his spirit when he saw the white ox-bones craftily tricked out."[^theog-anger]

"Because of this the tribes of men upon earth burn white bones to the deathless gods upon fragrant altars" — an aetiology for the Greek practice of offering bones and fat to the gods while mortals eat the meat.[^theog-sacrifice]

[^theog-trick]: "Prometheus was forward to cut up a great ox and set portions before them, trying to befool the mind of Zeus. Before the rest he set flesh and inner parts thick with fat upon the hide, covering them with an ox paunch; but for Zeus he put the white bones dressed up with cunning art and covered with shining fat" (Theogony 535-541)
[^theog-choose]: "'Son of Iapetus, most glorious of all lords, good sir, how unfairly you have divided the portions!' So said Zeus whose wisdom is everlasting, rebuking him. But wily Prometheus answered him, smiling softly and not forgetting his cunning trick" (Theogony 543-549)
[^theog-anger]: "Zeus, whose wisdom is everlasting, saw and failed not to perceive the trick, and in his heart he thought mischief against mortal men which also was to be fulfilled. With both hands he took up the white fat and was angry at heart, and wrath came to his spirit when he saw the white ox-bones craftily tricked out" (Theogony 550-557)
[^theog-sacrifice]: "because of this the tribes of men upon earth burn white bones to the deathless gods upon fragrant altars" (Theogony 556-557)

### The Theft of Fire

In retaliation, Zeus "would not give the power of unwearying fire to the Melian race of mortal men." But Prometheus "outwitted him and stole the far-seen gleam of unwearying fire in a hollow fennel stalk."[^theog-fire]

[^theog-fire]: "the noble son of Iapetus outwitted him and stole the far-seen gleam of unwearying fire in a hollow fennel stalk" (Theogony 563-567)

### The First Woman

As "the price of fire," Zeus had Hephaestus ("the very famous Limping God") form "of earth the likeness of a shy maiden." [Athena](athena.md) "girded and clothed her with silvery raiment, and down from her head she spread with her hands a broidered veil" and placed "lovely garlands, flowers of new-grown herbs" and a golden crown on her head.[^theog-woman]

She is called "the beautiful evil" and "sheer guile, not to be withstood by men." From her "is the race of women and female kind."[^theog-evil]

[^theog-woman]: "the very famous Limping God formed of earth the likeness of a shy maiden as the son of Cronos willed. And the goddess bright-eyed Athene girded and clothed her with silvery raiment, and down from her head she spread with her hands a broidered veil, a wonder to see" (Theogony 571-584)
[^theog-evil]: "when he had made the beautiful evil to be the price for the blessing, he brought her out... And wonder took hold of the deathless gods and mortal men when they saw that which was sheer guile, not to be withstood by men. For from her is the race of women and female kind" (Theogony 585-591)

### Punishment

Zeus "bound with inextricable bonds, cruel chains, and drove a shaft through his middle, and set on him a long-winged eagle, which used to eat his immortal liver; but by night the liver grew as much again everyway as the long-winged bird devoured in the whole day."[^theog-punishment]

He was eventually freed by [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md), "the valiant son of shapely-ankled Alcmene," who slew the eagle — "not without the will of Olympian Zeus who reigns on high, that the glory of Heracles the Theban-born might be yet greater than it was before."[^theog-release]

[^theog-punishment]: "ready-witted Prometheus he bound with inextricable bonds, cruel chains, and drove a shaft through his middle, and set on him a long-winged eagle, which used to eat his immortal liver; but by night the liver grew as much again everyway as the long-winged bird devoured in the whole day" (Theogony 521-525)
[^theog-release]: "That bird Heracles, the valiant son of shapely-ankled Alcmene, slew; and delivered the son of Iapetus from the cruel plague, and released him from his affliction—not without the will of Olympian Zeus who reigns on high, that the glory of Heracles the Theban-born might be yet greater than it was before over the plenteous earth" (Theogony 526-532)

## In Works and Days

[Works and Days](../sources/works-and-days.md) retells the fire-theft myth with significant differences. Here it is [Zeus](zeus.md) who speaks directly: "Son of Iapetus, surpassing all in cunning, you are glad that you have outwitted me and stolen fire — a great plague to you yourself and to men that shall be. But I will give men as the price for fire an evil thing in which they may all be glad of heart while they embrace their own destruction."[^wd-speech]

### Pandora

The first woman is here **named**: "he called this woman Pandora, because all they who dwelt on Olympus gave each a gift, a plague to men who eat bread."[^wd-name] Her creation is more collaborative:

- [Hephaestus](hephaestus.md) "moulded clay in the likeness of a modest maid"
- [Athena](athena.md) "girded and clothed her" and "bedecked her form with all manners of finery"
- The [Graces](graces.md) and Persuasion "put necklaces of gold upon her"
- The [Horae](horae.md) (Hours) "crowned her head with spring flowers"
- [Hermes](hermes.md) "contrived within her lies and crafty words and a deceitful nature" and "put speech in her"
- [Aphrodite](aphrodite.md) shed "grace upon her head and cruel longing and cares that weary the limbs"[^wd-creation]

### The Jar

[Hermes](hermes.md) delivered Pandora to [Epimetheus](epimetheus.md), who accepted her despite Prometheus's warning. "The woman took off the great lid of the jar with her hands and scattered all these and her thought caused sorrow and mischief to men. Only Hope remained there in an unbreakable home within under the rim of the great jar, and did not fly out at the door." Before Pandora, "the tribes of men lived on earth remote and free from ills and hard toil and heavy sickness."[^wd-jar]

[^wd-speech]: "Son of Iapetus, surpassing all in cunning, you are glad that you have outwitted me and stolen fire—a great plague to you yourself and to men that shall be. But I will give men as the price for fire an evil thing in which they may all be glad of heart while they embrace their own destruction" (Works and Days 54-59, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^wd-name]: "he called this woman Pandora, because all they who dwelt on Olympus gave each a gift, a plague to men who eat bread" (Works and Days 80-82)
[^wd-creation]: "the father of men and gods, and laughed aloud. And he bade famous Hephaestus make haste and mix earth with water and to put in it the voice and strength of human kind, and fashion a sweet, lovely maiden-shape, like to the immortal goddesses in face; and Athene to teach her needlework... and golden Aphrodite to shed grace upon her head... And he charged Hermes the guide, the Slayer of Argus, to put in her a shameless mind and a deceitful nature" (Works and Days 60-68)
[^wd-jar]: "the woman took off the great lid of the jar with her hands and scattered all these and her thought caused sorrow and mischief to men. Only Hope remained there in an unbreakable home within under the rim of the great jar, and did not fly out at the door; for ere that, the lid of the jar stopped her, by the will of Aegis-holding Zeus" (Works and Days 94-99)

## Siblings

- **Atlas** — "through hard constraint upholds the wide heaven with unwearying head and arms, standing at the borders of the earth before the clear-voiced Hesperides"[^theog-atlas]
- **Menoetius** — "was outrageous, and far-seeing Zeus struck him with a lurid thunderbolt and sent him down to [Erebus](erebus.md) because of his mad presumption and exceeding pride"[^theog-menoetius]
- **Epimetheus** — "scatter-brained... who from the first was a mischief to men who eat bread; for it was he who first took of Zeus the woman, the maiden whom he had formed"[^theog-epimetheus]

[^theog-atlas]: "Atlas through hard constraint upholds the wide heaven with unwearying head and arms, standing at the borders of the earth before the clear-voiced Hesperides" (Theogony 517-520)
[^theog-menoetius]: "Menoetius was outrageous, and far-seeing Zeus struck him with a lurid thunderbolt and sent him down to Erebus because of his mad presumption and exceeding pride" (Theogony 514-516)
[^theog-epimetheus]: "scatter-brained Epimetheus who from the first was a mischief to men who eat bread; for it was he who first took of Zeus the woman, the maiden whom he had formed" (Theogony 511-514)

## In the Bibliotheca

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) adds that Prometheus "moulded men out of water and earth" — making him humanity's creator, not merely their benefactor.[^apd-mould] He gave them fire "which, unknown to Zeus, he had hidden in a stalk of fennel," and [Zeus](zeus.md) ordered [Hephaestus](hephaestus.md) to nail him to Mount Caucasus in punishment.[^apd-fire] The account of his torment matches the Theogony: "Every day an eagle swooped on him and devoured the lobes of his liver, which grew by night."[^apd-eagle]

**VARIANT from Theogony:** The Theogony describes Prometheus bound with chains and a shaft driven through his middle; the Bibliotheca specifies he was nailed to Caucasus by Hephaestus. The Bibliotheca also adds the detail that Prometheus created humans from water and earth, which is not stated in Hesiod.

Prometheus's son was Deucalion, who "by the advice of Prometheus constructed a chest" and survived the great flood that [Zeus](zeus.md) sent to destroy the men of the Bronze Age.[^apd-flood]

[^apd-mould]: "Prometheus moulded men out of water and earth" (Bibliotheca 1.7.1, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-fire]: "gave them also fire, which, unknown to Zeus, he had hidden in a stalk of fennel. But when Zeus learned of it, he ordered Hephaestus to nail his body to Mount Caucasus" (Bibliotheca 1.7.1, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-eagle]: "Every day an eagle swooped on him and devoured the lobes of his liver, which grew by night" (Bibliotheca 1.7.1, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-flood]: "Deucalion by the advice of Prometheus constructed a chest, and having stored it with provisions he embarked in it with Pyrrha" (Bibliotheca 1.7.2, trans. Frazer)
