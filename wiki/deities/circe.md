## Overview

**Circe** is a daughter of [Helius](helius.md) and the Oceanid Perseis, and sister to Aeetes. She is a goddess who dwells on the island of Aia, where she lives in a palace of polished stone surrounded by enchanted beasts. In the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md), she transforms Odysseus's men into swine, but after Odysseus resists her magic with the aid of [Hermes](hermes.md), she becomes his host for a full year and guides him toward the land of the dead.

## Epithets

- **"of the braided tresses"** — her standard epithet in the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md)[^ep-braided]
- **"an awful goddess of mortal speech"** — introduced alongside her parentage[^ep-awful]
- **"fair goddess"** — used throughout the Odyssey narrative
- **"fair-tressed goddess"** — variant epithet in the Odyssey[^ep-fairtressed]

[^ep-braided]: "Circe of the braided tresses, an awful goddess of mortal speech" (Odyssey X.5448, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^ep-awful]: "Circe of the braided tresses, an awful goddess of mortal speech, own sister to the wizard Aeetes" (Odyssey X.5448-5449, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^ep-fairtressed]: "guileful Circe of Aia, would have stayed me in her halls, longing to have me for her lord" (Odyssey I.4762-4763, trans. Butcher and Lang)

## Powers

### Transformation

Circe's most prominent power is the transformation of men into beasts. She achieved this through a combination of drugged food and a wand: "she led them in and set them upon chairs and high seats, and made them a mess of cheese and barley-meal and yellow honey with Pramnian wine, and mixed harmful drugs with the food to make them utterly forget their own country. Now when she had given them the cup and they had drunk it off, presently she smote them with a wand, and in the styes of the swine she penned them."[^pow-transform]

The transformation was physical but not mental: "So they had the head and voice, the bristles and the shape of swine, but their mind abode even as of old."[^pow-mind]

She could also reverse the process. When she restored Odysseus's men, the result surpassed their original state: "she went through their midst, and anointed each one of them with another charm. And lo, from their limbs the bristles dropped away, wherewith the venom had erewhile clothed them, that lady Circe gave them. And they became men again, younger than before they were, and goodlier far, and taller to behold."[^pow-restore]

The mountain-bred wolves and lions around her palace were likewise men she had bewitched: "all around the palace mountain-bred wolves and lions were roaming, whom she herself had bewitched with evil drugs that she gave them. Yet the beasts did not set on my men, but lo, they ramped about them and fawned on them, wagging their long tails."[^pow-beasts]

### Drugs and Herbs

Circe's sorcery operates through "evil drugs" — pharmaka. Her transformation potion combines ordinary food (cheese, barley-meal, honey, Pramnian wine) with "harmful drugs" mixed in.[^pow-transform] The only counter to her magic is the herb moly, which [Hermes](hermes.md) gave to Odysseus: "black at the root, but the flower was like to milk. Moly the gods call it, but it is hard for mortal men to dig; howbeit with the gods all things are possible."[^pow-moly]

### Prophecy and Knowledge

Circe possesses knowledge of what is to come. [Hermes](hermes.md) had told her in advance that Odysseus would arrive: "Verily thou art Odysseus, ready at need, whom he of the golden wand, the slayer of Argos, full often told me was to come hither, on his way from Troy with his swift black ship."[^pow-prophecy] She also knows the way to [Hades](hades.md) and provides Odysseus with detailed instructions for the Nekuia — the consultation of the dead.[^pow-nekuia]

[^pow-nekuia]: "first must ye perform another journey, and reach the dwelling of Hades and of dread Persephone, to seek to the spirit of Theban Teiresias, the blind soothsayer, whose wits abide steadfast" (Odyssey X.5809-5815, trans. Butcher and Lang)

## In the Odyssey

### The Island of Aia (Book X)

Odysseus and his crew arrive at the island of Aia after their encounter with the Laestrygonians. Exploring inland, they discover Circe's palace: "In the forest glades they found the halls of Circe builded, of polished stone, in a place with wide prospect."[^od-halls] The palace is surrounded by enchanted beasts — wolves and lions that fawn on visitors rather than attacking them.[^pow-beasts]

Inside, Circe is at work at her loom: "within they heard Circe singing in a sweet voice, as she fared to and fro before the great web imperishable, such as is the handiwork of goddesses, fine of woof and full of grace and splendour."[^od-weaving]

### The Transformation of the Crew

Circe receives Odysseus's scouting party with apparent hospitality, giving them food and wine laced with drugs. When they drink, she strikes them with her wand and pens them in the sties of swine.[^pow-transform] Their bodies transform completely, yet "their mind abode even as of old."[^pow-mind]

### Hermes and the Herb Moly

When Odysseus goes to rescue his men, [Hermes](hermes.md) intercepts him, appearing "in the likeness of a young man with the first down on his lip."[^od-hermes] He warns Odysseus of Circe's sorcery and gives him the herb moly as protection — "black at the root, but the flower was like to milk."[^pow-moly]

### Circe Recognises Odysseus

When Circe's magic fails against Odysseus, she immediately identifies him: "Verily thou art Odysseus, ready at need, whom he of the golden wand, the slayer of Argos, full often told me was to come hither, on his way from Troy with his swift black ship."[^pow-prophecy] [Hermes](hermes.md) had prophesied his coming to her.

### The Restoration

At Odysseus's demand, Circe restores his men. The reversal surpasses the original — they become "younger than before they were, and goodlier far, and taller to behold."[^pow-restore]

### Circe's Handmaids

Circe is served by four supernatural handmaids: "four maidens that are her serving women in the house. They are born of the wells and of the woods and of the holy rivers, that flow forward into the salt sea."[^od-handmaids]

### A Year on Aia

Odysseus and his company remain with Circe for a full year: "So there we sat day by day for the full circle of a year, feasting on abundant flesh and sweet wine."[^od-year]

### Instructions for the Nekuia

When Odysseus asks to depart, Circe directs him not homeward but to the land of the dead, to consult the shade of Teiresias: "first must ye perform another journey, and reach the dwelling of [Hades](hades.md) and of dread [Persephone](persephone.md), to seek to the spirit of Theban Teiresias, the blind soothsayer, whose wits abide steadfast. To him [Persephone](persephone.md) hath given judgment, even in death, that he alone should have understanding; but the other souls sweep shadow-like around."[^od-teiresias]

She describes the geography of the underworld in detail: "when thou hast now sailed in thy ship across the stream [Oceanus](oceanus.md), where is a waste shore and the groves of [Persephone](persephone.md), even tall poplar trees and willows that shed their fruit before the season... Thereby into Acheron flows Pyriphlegethon, and Cocytus, a branch of the water of the [Styx](styx.md)."[^od-geography]

### Circe's Prophecies (Book XII)

After Odysseus and his crew return from the land of the dead, Circe meets them with a striking greeting: "Men overbold, who have gone alive into the house of [Hades](hades.md), to know death twice, while all men else die once for all."[^od-overbold] She feasts them one final time, then takes Odysseus aside to deliver detailed prophecies about the dangers ahead.

Circe warns of the **Sirens**, who bewitch all men who come near with their singing. She warns of **Scylla**, describing her as "no mortal, but an immortal plague, dread, grievous, and fierce, and not to be fought with," and counsels flight rather than combat — for "she is no mortal, but an immortal plague."[^od-scylla] She warns of **Charybdis**, the dread whirlpool that sucks down the dark water three times a day. And she warns of the island of **Thrinacia**, where the cattle of [Helius](helius.md) graze, urging Odysseus to leave them untouched if he wishes to see home again.

As they depart, Circe sends them on their way with a favorable wind: "in the wake of our dark-prowed ship she sent a favouring wind that filled the sails, a kindly escort, — even Circe of the braided tresses, a dread goddess of human speech."[^od-wind] This is her last direct action in the narrative, though her prophecies shape everything that follows in Book XII.

[^od-overbold]: "Men overbold, who have gone alive into the house of Hades, to know death twice, while all men else die once for all" (Odyssey XII.6555-6556, trans. Butcher and Lang)

[^od-hermes]: "in the likeness of a young man with the first down on his lip" (Odyssey X.5590, trans. Butcher and Lang)

[^od-year]: "So there we sat day by day for the full circle of a year, feasting on abundant flesh and sweet wine" (Odyssey X.5785-5787, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od-teiresias]: "first must ye perform another journey, and reach the dwelling of Hades and of dread Persephone, to seek to the spirit of Theban Teiresias, the blind soothsayer, whose wits abide steadfast. To him Persephone hath given judgment, even in death, that he alone should have understanding; but the other souls sweep shadow-like around" (Odyssey X.5809-5818, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od-geography]: "when thou hast now sailed in thy ship across the stream Oceanus, where is a waste shore and the groves of Persephone, even tall poplar trees and willows that shed their fruit before the season... Thereby into Acheron flows Pyriphlegethon, and Cocytus, a branch of the water of the Styx" (Odyssey X.5835-5854, trans. Butcher and Lang)

## Parentage

"Perseis, the daughter of Ocean, bare to unwearying Helios Circe and Aeetes the king."[^theog-parentage]

In the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md), this is expanded: "Circe of the braided tresses, an awful goddess of mortal speech, own sister to the wizard Aeetes. Both were begotten of [Helius](helius.md), who gives light to all men, and their mother was Perse, daughter of [Oceanus](oceanus.md)."[^od-parentage]

[^theog-parentage]: "Perseis, the daughter of Ocean, bare to unwearying Helios Circe and Aeetes the king" (Theogony 956-957, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^od-parentage]: "Circe of the braided tresses, an awful goddess of mortal speech, own sister to the wizard Aeetes. Both were begotten of Helios, who gives light to all men, and their mother was Perse, daughter of Oceanus" (Odyssey X.5448-5451, trans. Butcher and Lang)

## Later Traditions (Epic Cycle)

According to the [Telegony](../sources/epic-cycle.md) (attributed to Eugammon), Circe makes Telemachus, Penelope, and Telegonus immortal. In the [Returns](../sources/epic-cycle.md) and the Telegony, a variant tradition has Telemachus marrying Circe.
