## Overview

**Atlas** is a son of the [Titan](titans.md) [Iapetus](iapetus.md) and the Oceanid Clymene. He bears the sky upon his shoulders as a punishment assigned by [Zeus](zeus.md).

## Description

Atlas "through hard constraint upholds the wide heaven with unwearying head and arms, standing at the borders of the earth before the clear-voiced Hesperides; for this lot wise [Zeus](zeus.md) assigned to him."[^theog-atlas]

In the description of [Tartarus](../places/tartarus.md), he is placed at its entrance: "the son of [Iapetus](iapetus.md) stands immovably upholding the wide heaven upon his head and unwearying hands, where [Night](night.md) and Day draw near and greet one another as they pass the great threshold of bronze."[^theog-tartarus]

[^theog-atlas]: "Atlas through hard constraint upholds the wide heaven with unwearying head and arms, standing at the borders of the earth before the clear-voiced Hesperides; for this lot wise Zeus assigned to him" (Theogony 517-520, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^theog-tartarus]: "the son of Iapetus stands immovably upholding the wide heaven upon his head and unwearying hands, where Night and Day draw near and greet one another as they pass the great threshold of bronze" (Theogony 746-749)

## In the Odyssey

The [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) presents a **variant tradition** about Atlas. [Athena](athena.md) describes Calypso as "the daughter of the wizard Atlas, who knows the depths of every sea, and himself upholds the tall pillars which keep earth and sky asunder."[^od1-atlas]

This differs from the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md) in several ways: Atlas is called a "wizard" (suggesting knowledge rather than mere brute punishment), he "knows the depths of every sea" (a marine association absent from Hesiod), and he holds up "pillars" rather than the sky with his head and arms. The Odyssey also makes him the father of the nymph Calypso, a relationship not mentioned in the Theogony.

[^od1-atlas]: "the daughter of the wizard Atlas, who knows the depths of every sea, and himself upholds the tall pillars which keep earth and sky asunder" (Odyssey I.777-779, trans. Butcher and Lang)
