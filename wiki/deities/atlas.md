In the description of [Tartarus](../places/tartarus.md), he is placed at its entrance: "the son of [Iapetus](iapetus.md) stands immovably upholding the wide heaven upon his head and unwearying hands, where [Night](night.md) and Day draw near and greet one another as they pass the great threshold of bronze."[^theog-tartarus]
