## Overview

**Nymphs** are female divine beings associated with specific features of the natural world — mountains, rivers, springs, trees, and the sea. They appear throughout Greek myth as nurses of gods, companions of [Artemis](../artemis.md), objects of pursuit, mothers of heroes, and a pervasive divine presence in the landscape.

Their defining characteristic is an intermediate status between gods and mortals. [Aphrodite](../aphrodite.md) describes the mountain nymphs as beings who "rank neither with mortals nor with immortals: long indeed do they live, eating heavenly food and treading the lovely dance among the immortals," yet whose lives are bound to their landscape — "when the fate of death is near at hand, first those lovely trees wither."[^hh5-nature] They are long-lived but not truly deathless: mortal in the end, yet divine in their way of life.

[^hh5-nature]: "They rank neither with mortals nor with immortals: long indeed do they live, eating heavenly food and treading the lovely dance among the immortals... but when the fate of death is near at hand, first those lovely trees wither where they stand" (Homeric Hymn V to Aphrodite 256-264, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Types

### Meliae (Ash-Tree Nymphs)

The oldest nymphs in Hesiod's genealogy. When [Cronos](../cronos.md) castrated [Uranus](../uranus.md), "all the bloody drops that gushed forth Earth received, and as the seasons moved round she bare the strong [Erinyes](../../creatures/erinyes.md) and the great [Giants](../../creatures/giants.md) with gleaming armour, holding long spears in their hands and the Nymphs whom they call Meliae all over the boundless earth."[^theog-meliae] They are thus born from the blood of the sky, contemporaries of the Erinyes and Giants.

[^theog-meliae]: "All the bloody drops that gushed forth Earth received, and as the seasons moved round she bare the strong Erinyes and the great Giants with gleaming armour, holding long spears in their hands and the Nymphs whom they call Meliae all over the boundless earth" (Theogony 183-187, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

### Mountain Nymphs (Oreads)

[Gaia](../gaia.md) bore "long Hills, graceful haunts of the goddess-Nymphs who dwell amongst the glens of the hills."[^theog-hills] Mountain nymphs are the type most often described in the Homeric Hymns. They attend [Artemis](../artemis.md) in the hunt, and in the [Metamorphoses](../../sources/metamorphoses.md) they cluster around her to shield her when Actaeon stumbles upon her bathing.[^met-artemis]

An Oread (mountain nymph) is sent by [Demeter](../demeter.md) in the Metamorphoses to summon Famine from the frozen wastes of Scythia as punishment for [Erysichthon](../../heroes/erysichthon.md).[^met-oread]

[^theog-hills]: "She bare also long Hills, graceful haunts of the goddess-Nymphs who dwell amongst the glens of the hills" (Theogony 129-130, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^met-artemis]: "Her nymphs cluster around to shield her" but Artemis "stood head and shoulders taller than her guards" (Metamorphoses 3.178-185)
[^met-oread]: Metamorphoses 8.801-808. The sister dryads of the felled oak appealed to Demeter, who sent an Oread to Scythia.

### Nereids (Sea Nymphs)

The fifty daughters of [Nereus](../nereus.md) and Doris, described as "passing lovely amongst goddesses" and "skilled in excellent crafts."[^theog-nereids] The most prominent are [Thetis](../thetis.md) (mother of [Achilles](../../heroes/achilles.md)), [Amphitrite](../amphitrite.md) (consort of [Poseidon](../poseidon.md)), Galatea, and Psamathe. See [Nereus](../nereus.md) for a full catalogue.

In the [Iliad](../../sources/iliad.md), the Nereids gather around Thetis to lament when she grieves for Achilles' fate — "the daughters of the ancient one of the sea" rising from the deep.[^il18-nereids] In the [Argonautica](../../sources/argonautica.md), Thetis and the Nereids pass the [Argo](../../objects/argo.md) through the Wandering Rocks, tossing the ship between them "like a ball."[^arg-nereids]

[^theog-nereids]: Theogony 240-264
[^il18-nereids]: "The daughters of the ancient one of the sea" (Odyssey 24.67-69). In Iliad 18, the Nereids gather to lament with Thetis for Achilles.
[^arg-nereids]: Argonautica 4.930-967. Thetis and the Nereids guided the Argo through the Wandering Rocks.

### Oceanids

The three thousand daughters of [Oceanus](../oceanus.md) and [Tethys](../tethys.md), "dispersed far and wide."[^theog-oceanids] Unlike the sea-dwelling Nereids, Oceanids are associated with all waters and with various cosmological roles. Several are important figures in their own right: [Styx](../styx.md) (eldest, guardian of divine oaths), [Metis](../metis.md) (first wife of [Zeus](../zeus.md)), Clymene (mother of [Atlas](../atlas.md) and [Prometheus](../prometheus.md)), and Philyra (mother of [Chiron](../../creatures/chiron.md)).

The chorus of [Prometheus Bound](../../sources/aeschylus-prometheus-bound.md) is composed of Oceanids, who arrive in winged chariots to weep at Prometheus's suffering.[^pb-oceanids]

[^theog-oceanids]: "Three thousand are the neat-ankled daughters of Ocean who are dispersed far and wide" (Theogony 364-366, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^pb-oceanids]: Prometheus Bound 128-135. The Chorus of Oceanides arrives on winged cars.

### Naiads (Freshwater Nymphs)

Nymphs of rivers, springs, and lakes. They appear most often in genealogies as mothers or consorts: Periboea the Naiad is the mother of [Penelope](../../heroes/penelope.md), Batia the Naiad is the mother of [Tyndareus](../../heroes/tyndareus.md), Cleocharia the Naiad is the mother of Eurotas (ancestor of [Sparta](../../places/sparta.md)'s royal line), and Praxithea the Naiad married [Erichthonius](../../heroes/erichthonius.md).[^apd-naiads]

In the [Odyssey](../../sources/odyssey.md), Ithaca has a "cave of the Naiads" where Odysseus hides his treasure on his return.[^od-naiads] The [Metamorphoses](../../sources/metamorphoses.md) personifies them further — the Naiads anoint the newborn [Adonis](../../heroes/adonis.md) with his mother's tears, and the "Hesperian Naiads" entomb [Phaethon](../../heroes/phaethon.md) after his fall.[^met-naiads]

Hybris herself — the personification of [hubris](../../concepts/hubris.md) — is described as a Naiad nymph and mother of [Pan](../pan.md) by Zeus in one tradition.[^apd-hybris]

[^apd-naiads]: Bibliotheca 3.14.6 (Praxithea); Bibliotheca 3.10.6 (Batia); Bibliotheca 3.10.3 (Cleocharia); Bibliotheca 3.10.6 (Periboea).
[^od-naiads]: Odyssey 13.103-112. The cave of the Naiads at Ithaca.
[^met-naiads]: "The Naiads anointed him with his mother's tears" (Metamorphoses 10.515-518); "the Hesperian Naiads entombed him" (Metamorphoses 2.325-328).
[^apd-hybris]: Bibliotheca 3.8.2. Hybris as a Naiad nymph and mother of Pan.

### Dryads and Hamadryads (Tree Nymphs)

Nymphs bound to trees. In the [Metamorphoses](../../sources/metamorphoses.md), when [Erysichthon](../../heroes/erysichthon.md) fells a sacred oak, a voice speaks from within: "Covered by the bark of this oak tree I long have dwelt a Nymph, beloved of Ceres."[^met-dryad] The sister Dryads then appeal to Demeter for vengeance. Hamadryads are a closely related type; [Pomona](../../heroes/pomona.md) is called "the Latin Hamadryad," and the Naiad [Syrinx](../pan.md) dwelt "among the Hamadryads."[^met-hamadryad]

[^met-dryad]: "Covered by the bark of this oak tree I long have dwelt a Nymph, beloved of Ceres" (Metamorphoses 8.771-773)
[^met-hamadryad]: Metamorphoses 14.623 (Pomona as Hamadryad); Metamorphoses 1.690-691 (Syrinx among the Hamadryads).

## Roles in Myth

### Nurses of Gods and Heroes

Nymphs serve as foster-mothers to divine and semi-divine children, providing a safe space apart from both divine courts and mortal cities. [Zeus](../zeus.md) was given to "the nymphs Adrastia and Ida, daughters of Melisseus" in the cave of Dicte on [Crete](../../places/crete.md), where they fed him on the milk of Amalthea.[^apd-zeus-nurse] [Dionysus](../dionysus.md) was brought by [Hermes](../hermes.md) "to the nymphs who dwelt at Nysa in Asia," who reared him; Zeus later changed them into stars, the Hyades.[^apd-dion-nurse] The mountain nymphs of Ida were appointed by Aphrodite to raise her son [Aeneas](../../heroes/aeneas.md).[^hh5-aeneas-nurse]

[^apd-zeus-nurse]: "She gave him to the Curetes and to the nymphs Adrastia and Ida, daughters of Melisseus" (Bibliotheca 1.1.6, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-dion-nurse]: "Hermes took him and brought him to the nymphs who dwelt at Nysa in Asia, whom Zeus afterwards changed into stars and named them the Hyades" (Bibliotheca 3.4.3, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^hh5-aeneas-nurse]: "The deep-breasted mountain Nymphs who inhabit this great and holy mountain shall bring him up" (Homeric Hymn V to Aphrodite 256-257)

### Companions of the Gods

Nymphs form the retinues of several Olympians. [Pan](../pan.md) "wanders with dancing nymphs who foot it on some sheer cliff's edge."[^hh19-pan] [Artemis](../artemis.md) hunts with a band of nymphs who share her virginity — [Callisto](../../heroes/callisto.md) was among them before her seduction by Zeus. In the [Metamorphoses](../../sources/metamorphoses.md), nymphs gather flowers at the wedding of [Jason](../../heroes/jason.md) and [Medea](../../heroes/medea.md),[^arg-wedding] and [Circe](../circe.md) is attended by nymphs: "dryads born on Latin hills, Naiads" who once pined for her consort Picus.[^met-circe]

[^hh19-pan]: "Through wooded glades he wanders with dancing nymphs who foot it on some sheer cliff's edge" (Homeric Hymn XIX to Pan 2-3, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^arg-wedding]: Argonautica 4.1143-1145. Nymphs gathered flowers at Jason and Medea's wedding.
[^met-circe]: "Dryads born on Latin hills, Naiads would pine for him" (Metamorphoses 14.326-329)

### Objects of Pursuit

Many myths involve nymphs pursued by gods or satyrs. [Syrinx](../pan.md) fled Pan and was transformed into marsh reeds — "she implored her sister Nymphs to change her form: and Pan, believing he had caught her, held instead some marsh reeds for the body of the Nymph."[^met-syrinx] [Daphne](../../heroes/daphne.md), a river nymph, fled [Apollo](../apollo.md) and was transformed into a laurel tree. In the [Argonautica](../../sources/argonautica.md), a water-nymph at a spring seized Hylas and dragged him beneath the water to be her husband, prompting [Heracles](../../heroes/heracles.md)' frantic search.[^arg-hylas] [Echo](../../heroes/narcissus.md), a nymph cursed by [Hera](../hera.md) to only repeat others' words, wasted away from unrequited love for [Narcissus](../../heroes/narcissus.md).[^met-echo]

[^met-syrinx]: "She implored her sister Nymphs to change her form: and Pan, believing he had caught her, held instead some marsh reeds for the body of the Nymph" (Metamorphoses 1.705-707)
[^arg-hylas]: Argonautica 1.1207-1272. Hylas was taken by a water-nymph at a spring in Mysia.
[^met-echo]: Metamorphoses 3.356-401. Echo, cursed by Hera, pined for Narcissus until only her voice remained.

### Mothers of Heroes

Nymphs frequently appear in genealogies as mothers of important figures by gods or mortal kings. Some named examples:

- **Thoosa**, daughter of Phorcys — mother of Polyphemus by [Poseidon](../poseidon.md): "in the hollow caves she lay with Poseidon"[^od-thoosa]
- **Aegina** — mother of [Aeacus](../../heroes/aeacus.md) by Zeus, grandmother of Achilles[^apd-aegina]
- **Cyrene** — carried by [Apollo](../apollo.md) from the river Peneus to Libya, mother of Aristaeus[^arg-cyrene]
- **Liriope** — mother of [Narcissus](../../heroes/narcissus.md), who asked [Tiresias](../../heroes/tiresias.md) if her son would reach old age[^met-liriope]
- **Asterodeia**, a Caucasian nymph — mother of [Apsyrtus](../../heroes/apsyrtus.md) by Aeetes[^arg-asterodeia]
- **Chariclo** — mother of [Tiresias](../../heroes/tiresias.md)[^apd-chariclo]

[^od-thoosa]: "His mother was the nymph Thoösa, daughter of Phorcys... and in the hollow caves she lay with Poseidon" (Odyssey 1.71-73)
[^apd-aegina]: Bibliotheca 3.12.6. Aeacus was son of Zeus and the nymph Aegina.
[^arg-cyrene]: Argonautica 2.500-510. Apollo carried Cyrene from the river Peneus to Libya.
[^met-liriope]: "The nymph Liriope asked if her son Narcissus would attain old age" (Metamorphoses 3.346-348)
[^arg-asterodeia]: Argonautica 3.240-242. Asterodeia, a Caucasian nymph, mother of Apsyrtus.
[^apd-chariclo]: Bibliotheca 3.6.7. Tiresias son of Everes and the nymph Chariclo.

### Worship and Everyday Presence

Nymphs received worship alongside other gods. In the [Odyssey](../../sources/odyssey.md), the swineherd Eumaeus sacrifices "a portion for the nymphs and for [Hermes](../hermes.md) son of Maia" — a casual pairing that suggests nymphs were part of everyday rural piety, worshipped at local landmarks rather than grand temples.[^od-worship]

[^od-worship]: "A portion for the nymphs and for Hermes son of Maia" (Odyssey 14.420-423)

## Transformations

Nymphs are closely associated with [metamorphosis](../../concepts/metamorphosis.md). They are both agents and subjects of transformation: Syrinx becomes marsh reeds, Daphne becomes a laurel, [Canens](../circe.md) — a nymph whose singing voice "would move the woods and rocks and tame wild beasts, and stay long rivers" — "melted and vanished slowly in thin air" while searching for the transformed Picus.[^met-canens] In the [Aeneid](../../sources/aeneid.md), Cybele's ships are transformed into sea-nymphs.[^aen-ships] The grief of nymphs can also reshape the landscape — in the [Argonautica](../../sources/argonautica.md), "nymphs made a fountain from Cleite's tears."[^arg-cleite]

[^met-canens]: "A nymph whose singing voice would move the woods and rocks and tame wild beasts, and stay long rivers" who "melted and vanished slowly in thin air" (Metamorphoses 14.337-340, 14.432-434)
[^aen-ships]: Aeneid 9.77-122. Cybele's ships are transformed into sea-nymphs.
[^arg-cleite]: Argonautica 1.1063-1065. Nymphs made a fountain from Cleite's tears.
