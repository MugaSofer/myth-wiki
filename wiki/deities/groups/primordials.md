## Overview

The **Primordial deities** are the first beings to emerge in Hesiod's cosmogony, preceding the [Titans](titans.md) and [Olympians](olympians.md). They are not born from parents in the usual sense but arise spontaneously or from the fundamental elements of the cosmos.

## Members

As described in the [Theogony](../../sources/theogony.md):

### First Generation (self-arising)

1. [Chaos](../chaos.md) — "first of all" (Theogony 116); the primeval void
2. [Gaia](../gaia.md) — Earth; "the ever-sure foundation of all" (Theogony 117)
3. [Eros](../eros.md) — Love; "fairest among the deathless gods" (Theogony 120)

### Born from Chaos

4. [Erebus](../erebus.md) — Darkness
5. [Night](../night.md) (Nyx) — born alongside Erebus from Chaos

### Born from Gaia (without consort)

6. [Uranus](../uranus.md) — Heaven; "equal to herself, to cover her on every side" (Theogony 127)
7. [Pontus](../pontus.md) — Sea; "the fruitless deep with his raging swell" (Theogony 131)

## Note on Eros

[Eros](../eros.md) occupies a unique position: in the [Theogony](../../sources/theogony.md) he is among the first primordial beings, but in later sources he appears as a son of [Aphrodite](../aphrodite.md) (and sometimes [Ares](../ares.md)). These may represent different conceptions of the same force — cosmic principle versus personified god.

## In the Theogony

Hesiod's account of the origin of the cosmos begins with the emergence of four primordial beings: "Verily at the first Chaos came to be, but next wide-bosomed Earth, the ever-sure foundations of all the deathless ones who hold the peaks of snowy Olympus, and dim Tartarus in the depth of the wide-pathed Earth, and Eros (Love), fairest among the deathless gods, who unnerves the limbs and overcomes the mind and wise counsels of all gods and all men within them."[^theog-cosmogony]

[Chaos](../chaos.md) is named first but without further characterization. [Gaia](../gaia.md) is given an immediate function — she is the "ever-sure foundations" on which the later gods will dwell. [Tartarus](../../places/tartarus.md) appears as a place within Earth rather than a personified deity. [Eros](../eros.md) is described in active terms: he "unnerves the limbs and overcomes the mind," a cosmic force that will drive all subsequent generation.

From these first beings, the next generation arises quickly: "From Chaos came forth Erebus and black Night; but of Night were born Aether and Day, whom she conceived and bare from union in love with Erebus."[^theog-chaos-offspring] [Gaia](../gaia.md) then produces without a consort: "Earth first bare starry Heaven, equal to herself, to cover her on every side, and to be an ever-sure abiding-place for the blessed gods. And she brought forth long Hills, graceful haunts of the goddess-Nymphs who dwell amongst the glens of the hills. She bare also the fruitless deep with his raging swell, Pontus, without sweet union of love."[^theog-gaia-offspring]

With the birth of [Uranus](../uranus.md), Gaia then takes him as consort, and from their union come the [Titans](titans.md), the [Cyclopes](../../creatures/cyclopes.md), and the [Hundred-Handers](../../creatures/hundred-handers.md) — beginning the line of succession that leads to [Zeus](../zeus.md) and the [Olympians](olympians.md).

## In the Bibliotheca

[Apollodorus](../../sources/apollodorus.md) gives a much briefer cosmogony. He begins not with Chaos but with [Uranus](../uranus.md) (Sky) already established as ruler: "Sky was the first who ruled over the whole world. And having wedded Earth, he begat first the Hundred-handed."[^apd-beginning] The self-arising primordials — Chaos, Eros, Erebus, and Night — are absent from his account entirely. Apollodorus treats Uranus and Gaia as given starting points rather than beings who emerged from prior forces, and moves directly to their offspring.
