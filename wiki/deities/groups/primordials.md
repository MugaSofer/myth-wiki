## Overview

The **Primordial deities** are the first beings to emerge in Hesiod's cosmogony, preceding the [Titans](titans.md) and [Olympians](olympians.md). They are not born from parents in the usual sense but arise spontaneously or from the fundamental elements of the cosmos.

## Members

As described in the [Theogony](../../sources/theogony.md):

### First Generation (self-arising)

1. [Chaos](../chaos.md) — "first of all" (Theogony 116); the primeval void
2. [Gaia](../gaia.md) — Earth; "the ever-sure foundation of all" (Theogony 117)
3. [Eros](../eros.md) — Love; "fairest among the deathless gods" (Theogony 120)

### Born from Chaos

4. [Erebus](../erebus.md) — Darkness
5. [Night](../night.md) (Nyx) — born alongside Erebus from Chaos

### Born from Gaia (without consort)

6. [Uranus](../uranus.md) — Heaven; "equal to herself, to cover her on every side" (Theogony 127)
7. [Pontus](../pontus.md) — Sea; "the fruitless deep with his raging swell" (Theogony 131)

## Note on Eros

[Eros](../eros.md) occupies a unique position: in the [Theogony](../../sources/theogony.md) he is among the first primordial beings, but in later sources he appears as a son of [Aphrodite](../aphrodite.md) (and sometimes [Ares](../ares.md)). These may represent different conceptions of the same force — cosmic principle versus personified god.
