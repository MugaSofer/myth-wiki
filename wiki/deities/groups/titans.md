# The Titans

| | |
|---|---|
| **Parents** | [Gaia](../gaia.md) and [Uranus](../uranus.md) |
| **Number** | Twelve |
| **First appearance** | [Theogony](../../sources/theogony.md) 132 |

## Overview

The **Titans** are the twelve children of [Gaia](../gaia.md) (Earth) and [Uranus](../uranus.md) (Heaven), born before the [Cyclopes](../../creatures/cyclopes.md) and [Hundred-Handers](../../creatures/hundred-handers.md).

## Members

As listed in the [Theogony](../../sources/theogony.md):[^theog-list]

1. [Oceanus](../oceanus.md) ("deep-swirling")
2. [Coeus](../coeus.md)
3. [Crius](../crius.md)
4. [Hyperion](../hyperion.md)
5. [Iapetus](../iapetus.md)
6. [Theia](../theia.md)
7. [Rhea](../rhea.md)
8. [Themis](../themis.md)
9. [Mnemosyne](../mnemosyne.md)
10. [Phoebe](../phoebe.md) ("gold-crowned")
11. [Tethys](../tethys.md) ("lovely")
12. [Cronos](../cronos.md) ("the wily, youngest and most terrible of her children")

[^theog-list]: "she lay with Heaven and bare deep-swirling Oceanus, Coeus and Crius and Hyperion and Iapetus, Theia and Rhea, Themis and Mnemosyne and gold-crowned Phoebe and lovely Tethys. After them was born Cronos the wily, youngest and most terrible of her children, and he hated his lusty sire." (Theogony 132-138, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## In the Bibliotheca

Apollodorus lists the same twelve Titans with minor ordering differences. He names six male Titans: "Ocean, Coeus, Hyperion, Crius, Iapetus, and, youngest of all, Cronus" and six female Titanides: "Tethys, Rhea, Themis, Mnemosyne, Phoebe, Dione, Thia."[^apd-titan-list]

This list differs from the [Theogony](../../sources/theogony.md) in two respects: (1) it explicitly separates the Titans from the Titanides by sex, and (2) it includes **[Dione](../dione.md)** as a Titanide — a detail not present in the Theogony, where Dione appears only as an Oceanid ([Theogony](../../sources/theogony.md) 353) or as [Aphrodite](../aphrodite.md)'s mother in the [Iliad](../../sources/iliad.md). Making Dione a Titanide elevates her status and is consistent with Apollodorus's treatment of her as a consort of [Zeus](../zeus.md) (1.3.1).

Apollodorus also notes that in the revolt against [Uranus](../uranus.md), "they, all but Ocean, attacked him."[^apd-titan-revolt] This is new: the Theogony presents only [Cronos](../cronos.md) as acting. Apollodorus makes it a collective Titan uprising with [Oceanus](../oceanus.md) as the sole abstainer.

[^apd-titan-list]: "the Titans as they are named: Ocean, Coeus, Hyperion, Crius, Iapetus, and, youngest of all, Cronus; also daughters, the Titanides as they are called: Tethys, Rhea, Themis, Mnemosyne, Phoebe, Dione, Thia" (Bibliotheca 1.1.3, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-titan-revolt]: "they, all but Ocean, attacked him, and Cronus cut off his father's genitals and threw them into the sea" (Bibliotheca 1.1.4, trans. Frazer)
