## Overview

The **Olympians** are the major gods who dwell on [Mount Olympus](../../places/olympus.md) and rule the cosmos after the defeat of the [Titans](titans.md) in the [Titanomachy](../../events/titanomachy.md). The canonical count is twelve, though ancient sources vary on exact membership.

## Members

The core Olympians as attested across multiple sources:

1. [Zeus](../zeus.md) — king of the gods; sky and thunder
2. [Hera](../hera.md) — queen of the gods; marriage
3. [Poseidon](../poseidon.md) — sea and earthquakes
4. [Athena](../athena.md) — wisdom, warfare, and crafts
5. [Apollo](../apollo.md) — archery, music, prophecy, plague
6. [Artemis](../artemis.md) — hunting, wild animals, the moon

### Variable Members

- [Hestia](../hestia.md) — hearth; sometimes counted among the twelve in place of Dionysus
- [Hades](../hades.md) — lord of the underworld; shares the three-way division of the cosmos with Zeus and Poseidon but dwells beneath the earth rather than on Olympus

### Other Olympus-Dwelling Deities

Several deities reside on or frequent Olympus without traditionally being counted among the twelve:

- [Hebe](../hebe.md) — cupbearer of the gods
- [Eileithyia](../eileithyia.md) — goddess of childbirth
- [Iris](../iris.md) — divine messenger

- The [Graces](graces.md) (Charites) — beauty and charm
- The [Horae](horae.md) (Hours) — order and the seasons

## In the Theogony

### Birth of the Older Olympians

The first Olympians were children of [Cronos](../cronos.md) and [Rhea](../rhea.md). Hesiod names them in birth order: "Rhea was subject in love to Cronos and bare splendid children, Hestia, Demeter, and gold-shod Hera and strong Hades, pitiless in heart, who dwells under the earth, and the loud-crashing Earth-Shaker, and wise Zeus, father of gods and men, by whose thunder the wide earth is shaken."[^theog-rhea-children] Cronos swallowed each child at birth, "for he learned from Earth and starry Heaven that he was destined to be overcome by his own son."[^theog-swallowing] Only [Zeus](../zeus.md), the youngest, escaped — hidden in Crete by Rhea, who gave Cronos a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes instead.

### Rise of Zeus

When Zeus reached maturity, he forced Cronos to disgorge his siblings: "great Cronos the wily was beguiled by the deep suggestions of Earth, and brought up again his offspring, vanquished by the arts and might of his own son."[^theog-disgorge] Zeus then freed the [Cyclopes](../../creatures/cyclopes.md) from [Tartarus](../../places/tartarus.md), who "gave him thunder and the glowing thunderbolt and lightening: for before that, huge Earth had hidden these. In them he trusts and rules over mortals and immortals."[^theog-thunderbolt]

### The Titanomachy

The war between the younger gods and the [Titans](titans.md) lasted ten years. Zeus secured victory by enlisting the [Hundred-Handers](../../creatures/hundred-handers.md): "the Titan gods and as many as sprang from Cronos had long been fighting together in stubborn war with heart-grieving toil, the lordly Titans from high Othyrs, but the gods, givers of good, whom rich-haired Rhea bare in union with Cronos, from Olympus."[^theog-titanomachy] After the Titans' defeat, they were shut in Tartarus.

### Division of Honours

After the [Titanomachy](../../events/titanomachy.md), "when the blessed gods had finished their toil, and settled by force their struggle for honours with the Titans, they pressed far-seeing Olympian Zeus to reign and to rule over them, by Earth's prompting. So he divided their dignities amongst them."[^theog-honours]

### Zeus's Marriages and the Younger Olympians

Zeus then established the Olympian order through a succession of divine marriages, each producing gods and goddesses who joined the pantheon:

- By [Metis](../metis.md): [Athena](../athena.md), "the awful, the strife-stirring, the host-leader, the unwearying, the queen"[^theog-athena] — born from Zeus's own head after he swallowed her pregnant mother
- By [Themis](../themis.md): the [Horae](horae.md) (Order, Justice, Peace) and the [Fates](fates.md) (Clotho, Lachesis, Atropos)[^theog-themis]
- By [Eurynome](../eurynome.md): the [Graces](graces.md) (Aglaea, Euphrosyne, Thaleia)[^theog-eurynome]
- By [Demeter](../demeter.md): [Persephone](../persephone.md), "whom Aidoneus carried off from her mother"[^theog-demeter]
- By [Mnemosyne](../mnemosyne.md): the nine [Muses](muses.md)[^theog-mnemosyne]
- By [Leto](../leto.md): [Apollo](../apollo.md) and [Artemis](../artemis.md), "children lovely above all the sons of Heaven"[^theog-leto]
- By [Hera](../hera.md): [Hebe](../hebe.md), [Ares](../ares.md), and [Eileithyia](../eileithyia.md)[^theog-hera]

[Hephaestus](../hephaestus.md) was born separately: "Hera without union with Zeus — for she was very angry and quarrelled with her mate — bare famous Hephaestus, who is skilled in crafts more than all the sons of Heaven."[^theog-hephaestus]

## In the Bibliotheca

### The Three-Way Division

[Apollodorus](../../sources/apollodorus.md) describes how the three sons of Cronos divided the cosmos after the [Titanomachy](../../events/titanomachy.md). Zeus freed the Hundred-Handers and Cyclopes from Tartarus as allies: "the Cyclopes then gave Zeus thunder and lightning and a thunderbolt, and on Pluto they bestowed a helmet and on Poseidon a trident. Armed with these weapons the gods overcame the Titans, shut them up in Tartarus, and appointed the Hundred-handers their guards; but they themselves cast lots for the sovereignty, and to Zeus was allotted the dominion of the sky, to Poseidon the dominion of the sea, and to Pluto the dominion in Hades."[^apd-division]

### Zeus's Consorts and Offspring

Apollodorus lists Zeus's marriages with some differences from Hesiod: "Zeus wedded Hera and begat Hebe, Ilithyia, and Ares, but he had intercourse with many women, both mortals and immortals."[^apd-zeus-hera] His divine consorts produced:

- By [Themis](../themis.md): the Seasons (Peace, Order, Justice) and the [Fates](fates.md) (Clotho, Lachesis, Atropos)
- By [Dione](../dione.md): [Aphrodite](../aphrodite.md)
- By [Eurynome](../eurynome.md): the [Graces](graces.md)
- By [Styx](../styx.md): [Persephone](../persephone.md)
- By [Mnemosyne](../mnemosyne.md): the [Muses](muses.md)

Notable differences from the [Theogony](../../sources/theogony.md): Apollodorus names [Dione](../dione.md) rather than [Uranus](../uranus.md) as the source of [Aphrodite](../aphrodite.md)'s birth (following the Homeric tradition), and names [Styx](../styx.md) rather than [Demeter](../demeter.md) as [Persephone](../persephone.md)'s mother.

Apollodorus also reports competing traditions for [Hephaestus](../hephaestus.md): "Hera gave birth to Hephaestus without intercourse with the other sex, but according to Homer he was one of her children by Zeus."[^apd-hephaestus]
