## Overview

**Styx** is a daughter of [Oceanus](oceanus.md), described as "the chiefest of them all" among the Oceanids, and "eldest daughter of back-flowing Ocean."[^theog-chief] She serves as the great oath of the gods.

With Pallas, Styx bore "Zelus (Emulation) and trim-ankled Nike (Victory) in the house. Also she brought forth Cratos (Strength) and Bia (Force), wonderful children."[^theog-children] These children "have no house apart from [Zeus](zeus.md), nor any dwelling nor path except that wherein God leads them, but they dwell always with Zeus the loud-thunderer."[^theog-dwell]

## Mythology

### Becoming the Oath of the Gods

When [Zeus](zeus.md) called the gods to [Olympus](../places/olympus.md) before the [Titanomachy](../events/titanomachy.md), promising to preserve the rights of any who fought with him, "deathless Styx came first to Olympus with her children through the wit of her dear father."[^theog-first] Zeus "honoured her, and gave her very great gifts, for her he appointed to be the great oath of the gods, and her children to live with him always."[^theog-oath]

[^theog-first]: "So deathless Styx came first to Olympus with her children through the wit of her dear father" (Theogony 397-398)
[^theog-oath]: "Zeus honoured her, and gave her very great gifts, for her he appointed to be the great oath of the gods, and her children to live with him always" (Theogony 399-401)

### The Oath by Styx

Any god who swears falsely by Styx's water "lies breathless until a full year is completed, and never comes near to taste ambrosia and nectar, but lies spiritless and voiceless on a strewn bed: and a heavy trance overshadows him." After the year, "another penance and an harder follows... For nine years he is cut off from the eternal gods and never joins their councils or their feasts, nine full years. But in the tenth year he comes again."[^theog-penalty]

[^theog-penalty]: "whoever of the deathless gods that hold the peaks of snowy Olympus pours a libation of her water is forsworn, lies breathless until a full year is completed, and never comes near to taste ambrosia and nectar, but lies spiritless and voiceless on a strewn bed: and a heavy trance overshadows him. But when he has spent a long year in his sickness, another penance and an harder follows after the first. For nine years he is cut off from the eternal gods and never joins their councils of their feasts, nine full years. But in the tenth year he comes again to join the assemblies of the deathless gods" (Theogony 793-804)

## Dwelling

Styx "lives apart from the gods in her glorious house vaulted over with great rocks and propped up to heaven all round with silver pillars."[^theog-house]

[^theog-house]: "She lives apart from the gods in her glorious house vaulted over with great rocks and propped up to heaven all round with silver pillars" (Theogony 778-779)

## In the Iliad

The river Titaresios is described as "an offspring from the water of Styx, the dread river of the oath" — it flows over the Peneios "like unto oil" without mingling.[^il2-styx]

[^il2-styx]: "he is an offspring from the water of Styx, the dread river of the oath" (Iliad 2.732-733, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

## In the Odyssey

In [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) Book V, Calypso swears by Styx to assure Odysseus she means no treachery: "Let earth be now witness hereto, and the wide heaven above, and that falling water of the Styx, the greatest oath and the most terrible to the blessed gods."[^od5-styx]

[^od5-styx]: "Let earth be now witness hereto, and the wide heaven above, and that falling water of the Styx, the greatest oath and the most terrible to the blessed gods, that I will not plan any hidden guile to thine own hurt" (Odyssey 5.185-188, trans. Butcher and Lang)
