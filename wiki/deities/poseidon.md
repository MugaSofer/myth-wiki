## Appearance

The most vivid description comes in [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book XIII, where Poseidon makes his grand descent: "Three strides he made, and with the fourth he reached his goal, even Aigae, and there was his famous palace in the deeps of the mere, his glistering golden mansions builded, imperishable for ever." He harnesses "bronze-hooved horses, swift of flight, clothed with their golden manes," takes "the well-wrought lash of gold," and dons golden armour. As he drives across the waves, "the sea beasts frolicked beneath him, on all sides out of the deeps, for well they knew their lord, and with gladness the sea stood asunder, and swiftly they sped, and the axle of bronze was not wetted beneath."[^desc-chariot]

In Book XIV, fighting openly while [Zeus](zeus.md) sleeps, he carries "a dread sword of fine edge in his strong hand, like unto lightning."[^desc-sword]

[^desc-chariot]: "Three strides he made, and with the fourth he reached his goal, even Aigae, and there was his famous palace in the deeps of the mere, his glistering golden mansions builded, imperishable for ever. Thither went he, and let harness to the car his bronze-hooved horses, swift of flight, clothed with their golden manes. He girt his own golden array about his body, and seized the well-wrought lash of gold, and mounted his chariot, and forth he drove across the waves. And the sea beasts frolicked beneath him, on all sides out of the deeps, for well they knew their lord, and with gladness the sea stood asunder" (Iliad XIII.7421-7431, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^desc-sword]: "The Shaker of the earth led them, wielding in his strong hand a dread sword of fine edge in his strong hand, like unto lightning, wherewith it is not permitted that any should mingle in deadly battle, but fear keepeth men therefrom" (Iliad XIV.8655-8658)

## Powers

- **Earthquakes:** "From beneath Poseidon made the vast earth shake, and the steep tops of the mountains," so that even [Hades](hades.md) "leapt from his throne and cried aloud, in terror lest the earth-shaker Poseidon rend the earth asunder from above."[^desc-earthquake]
- **Sea mastery:** The sea parts before him and sea beasts frolic in recognition; he drives his golden chariot unwetted across the waves.[^desc-chariot]
- **Voice:** He shouts with a voice "as of nine thousand men, or ten thousand" when he leads the Greeks openly.[^desc-voice]
- **Disguise:** He appears as the seer Kalchas and as Thoas in Book XIII, and as an old man taking Agamemnon's hand in Book XIV. Aias recognises him: "easily I knew the tokens of his feet and knees as he turned away, and the gods are easy to discern."[^desc-disguise]
- **Spells and protection:** He paralyzes Alkathoos for Idomeneus, "throwing a spell over his shining eyes, and snaring his glorious limbs." He also shields Antilochos from javelins on all sides.[^desc-spell]
- **Destruction:** With his trident, he leads the destruction of the Achaian wall after the war, sending "all the foundations of beams and stones" into the waves and making "all smooth by the strong current of the Hellespont."[^desc-trident]

[^desc-earthquake]: "from beneath Poseidon made the vast earth shake, and the steep tops of the mountains. All the roots of many-fountained Ida were shaken, and all her crests, and the city of the Trojans, and the ships of the Achaians. And Aidoneus, lord of the dead below, had terror and leapt from his throne and cried aloud, in terror lest the earth-shaker Poseidon rend the earth asunder from above" (Iliad XX.11397-11403)
[^desc-voice]: "loudly he shouted, with might as of nine thousand men, or ten thousand" (Iliad XIV.8654-8655)
[^desc-disguise]: "easily I knew the tokens of his feet and knees as he turned away, and the gods are easy to discern" (Iliad XIII.7472-7473)
[^desc-spell]: "Poseidon subdue to Idomeneus, throwing a spell over his shining eyes, and snaring his glorious limbs; so that he might neither flee backwards, nor avoid the stroke, but stood steady as a pillar" (Iliad XIII.7821-7824)
[^desc-trident]: "the Shaker of the earth, with his trident in his hands, was himself the leader, and sent forth into the waves all the foundations of beams and stones that the Achaians had laid with toil, and made all smooth by the strong current of the Hellespont" (Iliad XII.6993-6998)

## Mythology

Poseidon "fixed gates of bronze upon" [Tartarus](../places/tartarus.md) to imprison the [Titans](titans.md), "and a wall runs all round it on every side."[^theog-gates]

He lay with [Medusa](../creatures/gorgons.md) "in a soft meadow amid spring flowers," and from her slain body sprang [Pegasus](../creatures/pegasus.md) and Chrysaor.[^theog-medusa]

With Amphitrite, he fathered "great, wide-ruling Triton, and he owns the depths of the sea, living with his dear mother and the lord his father in their golden house, an awful god."[^theog-triton]

He made Briareos (one of the [Hundred-Handers](../creatures/hundred-handers.md)) "his son-in-law, giving him Cymopolea his daughter to wed."[^theog-briareos]

[^theog-gates]: "Poseidon fixed gates of bronze upon it, and a wall runs all round it on every side" (Theogony 732-733, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^theog-medusa]: "With her lay the Dark-haired One in a soft meadow amid spring flowers" (Theogony 278-279)
[^theog-triton]: "of Amphitrite and the loud-roaring Earth-Shaker was born great, wide-ruling Triton, and he owns the depths of the sea, living with his dear mother and the lord his father in their golden house, an awful god" (Theogony 930-933)
[^theog-briareos]: "Briareos, being goodly, the deep-roaring Earth-Shaker made his son-in-law, giving him Cymopolea his daughter to wed" (Theogony 817-819)

## In the Odyssey

### Wrath Over Polyphemus (Book I)

In the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md), Poseidon is Odysseus's primary divine antagonist. "All the gods had pity on him save Poseidon, who raged continually against godlike Odysseus, till he came to his own country."[^od1-rage]

[Zeus](zeus.md) explains the source of his anger: "it is Poseidon, the girdler of the earth, that hath been wroth continually with quenchless anger for the Cyclops' sake whom he blinded of his eye, even godlike Polyphemus whose power is mightiest amongst all the Cyclôpes. His mother was the nymph Thoösa, daughter of Phorcys, lord of the unharvested sea, and in the hollow caves she lay with Poseidon."[^od1-polyphemus]

Poseidon does not seek to kill Odysseus outright: "From that day forth Poseidon the earth-shaker doth not indeed slay Odysseus, but driveth him wandering from his own country."[^od1-wandering] Zeus observes that Poseidon "will in no wise be able to strive alone against all, in despite of all the deathless gods."[^od1-alone]

At the opening of the poem, Poseidon is absent from the divine council: "Poseidon had now departed for the distant Ethiopians, the Ethiopians that are sundered in twain, the uttermost of men... There he looked to receive his hecatomb of bulls and rams."[^od1-ethiopia]

### Destroying Locrian Aias (Book IV)

In Menelaus's account of Proteus's prophecy, Poseidon's dual nature is vividly shown. He first saves Aias (the Locrian, son of Oileus) from the sea: "Poseidon at first brought him nigh to Gyrae, to the mighty rocks, and delivered him from the sea." But when Aias boasted blasphemously — "he said that in the gods' despite he had escaped the great gulf of the sea" — Poseidon responded with devastating force: "Poseidon heard his loud boasting, and presently caught up his trident into his strong hands, and smote the rock Gyraean and cleft it in twain... and the rock bore him down into the vast and heaving deep."[^od4-aias]

[^od4-aias]: "Poseidon at first brought him nigh to Gyrae, to the mighty rocks, and delivered him from the sea. And so he would have fled his doom, albeit hated by Athene, had he not let a proud word fall in the fatal darkening of his heart. He said that in the gods' despite he had escaped the great gulf of the sea; and Poseidon heard his loud boasting, and presently caught up his trident into his strong hands, and smote the rock Gyraean and cleft it in twain." (Odyssey IV.2614-2621, trans. Butcher and Lang)

[^od1-rage]: "all the gods had pity on him save Poseidon, who raged continually against godlike Odysseus, till he came to his own country" (Odyssey I.746-748, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od1-polyphemus]: "it is Poseidon, the girdler of the earth, that hath been wroth continually with quenchless anger for the Cyclops' sake whom he blinded of his eye, even godlike Polyphemus whose power is mightiest amongst all the Cyclôpes. His mother was the nymph Thoösa, daughter of Phorcys, lord of the unharvested sea, and in the hollow caves she lay with Poseidon." (Odyssey I.792-797, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od1-wandering]: "From that day forth Poseidon the earth-shaker doth not indeed slay Odysseus, but driveth him wandering from his own country" (Odyssey I.797-798, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od1-alone]: "Poseidon let go his displeasure, for he will in no wise be able to strive alone against all, in despite of all the deathless gods" (Odyssey I.800-802, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od1-ethiopia]: "Poseidon had now departed for the distant Ethiopians, the Ethiopians that are sundered in twain, the uttermost of men, abiding some where Hyperion sinks and some where he rises. There he looked to receive his hecatomb of bulls and rams" (Odyssey I.748-752, trans. Butcher and Lang)

### Poseidon and Tyro (Book XI)

In the catalogue of heroines, Tyro loved the river Enipeus, and Poseidon seduced her in Enipeus's form: "the girdler of the world, the Earth-shaker, put on the shape of the god, and lay by the lady at the mouths of the whirling stream. Then the dark wave stood around them like a hill-side bowed, and hid the god and the mortal woman." He told her: "Woman, be glad in our love, and when the year comes round thou shalt give birth to glorious children,—for not weak are the embraces of the gods... behold, I am Poseidon, shaker of the earth." She bore Pelias and Neleus.[^od11-tyro]

Also in the catalogue, Iphimedeia "said that she had lain with Poseidon, and she bare children twain... godlike Otus and far-famed Ephialtes" — the giants who tried to pile mountains to reach Olympus.[^od11-iphimedeia]

[^od11-tyro]: "the girdler of the world, the Earth-shaker, put on the shape of the god, and lay by the lady at the mouths of the whirling stream. Then the dark wave stood around them like a hill-side bowed, and hid the god and the mortal woman... Woman, be glad in our love, and when the year comes round thou shalt give birth to glorious children,—for not weak are the embraces of the gods... behold, I am Poseidon, shaker of the earth" (Odyssey XI.6124-6141, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od11-iphimedeia]: "said that she had lain with Poseidon, and she bare children twain... godlike Otus and far-famed Ephialtes" (Odyssey XI.6191-6203, trans. Butcher and Lang)

### Polyphemus's Prayer (Book IX)

After Odysseus blinds [Polyphemus](../creatures/cyclopes.md), the Cyclops prays to his father: "Hear me, Poseidon, girdler of the earth, god of the dark hair, if indeed I be thine, and thou avowest thee my sire,—grant that he may never come to his home, even Odysseus, waster of cities, the son of Laertes, whose dwelling is in Ithaca; yet if he is ordained to see his friends and come unto his well-builded house, and his own country, late may he come in evil case, with the loss of all his company, in the ship of strangers, and find sorrows in his house." And "the god of the dark locks heard him."[^od9-prayer]

This prayer — which Poseidon grants — exactly describes the course of Odysseus's return: arriving late, alone, on a Phaeacian ship, to find his house beset by suitors.

[^od9-prayer]: "Hear me, Poseidon, girdler of the earth, god of the dark hair, if indeed I be thine, and thou avowest thee my sire,—grant that he may never come to his home, even Odysseus, waster of cities, the son of Laertes, whose dwelling is in Ithaca; yet if he is ordained to see his friends and come unto his well-builded house, and his own country, late may he come in evil case, with the loss of all his company, in the ship of strangers, and find sorrows in his house... So he spake in prayer, and the god of the dark locks heard him" (Odyssey IX.5263-5272, trans. Butcher and Lang)

### The Storm (Book V)

Returning from the Ethiopians, Poseidon spots Odysseus near Phaeacia: "the lord, the shaker of the earth, on his way from the Ethiopians espied him afar off from the mountains of the Solymi... and he was mightily angered in spirit." He declares: "methinks, that even yet I will drive him far enough in the path of suffering."[^od5-espied]

He then unleashes a full storm: "he gathered the clouds and troubled the waters of the deep, grasping his trident in his hands; and he roused all storms of all manner of winds, and shrouded in clouds the land and sea: and down sped night from heaven."[^od5-storm] He smashes Odysseus's raft with a great wave, then departs with a final pronouncement: "Even so, after all thy sufferings, go wandering over the deep, till thou shalt come among a people, the fosterlings of Zeus. Yet for all that I deem not that thou shalt think thyself too lightly afflicted."[^od5-depart]

[^od5-espied]: "the lord, the shaker of the earth, on his way from the Ethiopians espied him afar off from the mountains of the Solymi: even thence he saw Odysseus as he sailed over the deep; and he was mightily angered in spirit" (Odyssey V.3255-3258, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od5-storm]: "he gathered the clouds and troubled the waters of the deep, grasping his trident in his hands; and he roused all storms of all manner of winds, and shrouded in clouds the land and sea: and down sped night from heaven" (Odyssey V.3265-3268)
[^od5-depart]: "Even so, after all thy sufferings, go wandering over the deep, till thou shalt come among a people, the fosterlings of Zeus. Yet for all that I deem not that thou shalt think thyself too lightly afflicted" (Odyssey V.3355-3358)

### Punishment of the Phaeacians (Book XIII)

When Poseidon discovers that the Phaeacians have safely conveyed Odysseus home to Ithaca, he is outraged. He complains to [Zeus](zeus.md): "Father Zeus, I for one shall no longer be of worship among the deathless gods, when mortal men hold me in no regard, even Phaeacians, who moreover are of mine own lineage."[^od13-complaint] Zeus gives him free rein: "Do thou as thou wilt, and as seems thee good."[^od13-zeus]

Poseidon strikes as the Phaeacian ship returns to Scheria: "he smote her into a stone, and rooted her far below with the down-stroke of his hand."[^od13-stone] King Alcinous recognises the fulfilment of an ancient oracle — that Poseidon would one day punish the Phaeacians, "for that we give safe escort to all men."[^od13-oracle] In response, the Phaeacians offer twelve chosen bulls to appease him.[^od13-bulls]

This episode completes the arc begun in Books V and VIII: Poseidon's wrath, unable to prevent Odysseus's return, falls instead on those who aided it. The Phaeacians — his own descendants through Nausithous — are punished not for opposing him, but for rendering his opposition meaningless.

[^od13-complaint]: "Father Zeus, I for one shall no longer be of worship among the deathless gods, when mortal men hold me in no regard, even Phaeacians, who moreover are of mine own lineage" (Odyssey XIII.7108-7111, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od13-zeus]: "Do thou as thou wilt, and as seems thee good" (Odyssey XIII.7124-7125, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od13-stone]: "he smote her into a stone, and rooted her far below with the down-stroke of his hand" (Odyssey XIII.7145-7147, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od13-oracle]: "jealous of us, for that we give safe escort to all men" (Odyssey XIII.7160-7161, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od13-bulls]: "let us sacrifice to him twelve chosen bulls, if perchance he may take pity, and not overshadow our city with a long mountain" (Odyssey XIII.7167-7173, trans. Butcher and Lang)

## In the Iliad

### The Binding of Zeus (Book I)

Poseidon is named as one of three Olympians — along with [Hera](hera.md) and [Athena](athena.md) — who conspired to bind [Zeus](zeus.md), thwarted when [Thetis](thetis.md) summoned [Briareus](../creatures/hundred-handers.md) of the hundred arms.[^il1-binding]

### Jealous of the Achaian Wall (Book VII)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book VII, Poseidon complains to [Zeus](zeus.md) about the Greeks' new wall: "is there any man throughout the boundless earth that will any more declare to the immortals his mind and counsel? Seest thou not how the flowing-haired Achaians have now again built them a wall before their ships, and drawn a foss around it, but gave not excellent hecatombs to the gods? Verily the fame thereof shall reach as far as the dawn spreadeth, and men will forget the wall that I and Phoebus [Apollo](apollo.md) built with travail for the hero Laomedon."[^il7-wall]

Zeus reassures him: "thine shall be the fame as far as the dawn spreadeth. Go to now, hereafter when the flowing-haired Achaians be departed upon their ships to their dear native land, then burst thou this wall asunder and scatter it all into the sea, and cover the great sea-beach over with sand again, that the great wall of the Achaians be brought to naught."[^il7-zeus-reply]

This passage reveals that Poseidon and Apollo once built Troy's walls under forced service to the mortal king Laomedon — and that Poseidon is sensitive about mortal constructions rivalling divine ones.

### Destroying the Achaian Wall (Book XII)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book XII, the poem describes how, after the war ended, Poseidon and [Apollo](apollo.md) fulfilled the promise from Book VII: "Poseidon and Apollo took counsel to wash away the wall, bringing in the might of the rivers, of all that flow from the hills of Ida to the sea." Apollo "turned together" the mouths of nine rivers and "for nine days he drave their stream against the wall; and still [Zeus](zeus.md) rained unceasingly." Meanwhile "the Shaker of the earth, with his trident in his hands, was himself the leader, and sent forth into the waves all the foundations of beams and stones that the Achaians had laid with toil, and made all smooth by the strong current of the Hellespont, and covered again the great beach with sand."[^il12-wall]

[^il12-wall]: "Poseidon and Apollo took counsel to wash away the wall, bringing in the might of the rivers... the mouths of all these waters did Phoebus Apollo turn together, and for nine days he drave their stream against the wall; and still Zeus rained unceasingly, that the quicker he might mingle the wall with the salt sea. And the Shaker of the earth, with his trident in his hands, was himself the leader, and sent forth into the waves all the foundations of beams and stones that the Achaians had laid with toil, and made all smooth by the strong current of the Hellespont, and covered again the great beach with sand, when he had swept away the wall" (Iliad XII.6984-6998, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

[^il1-binding]: "all the other Olympians would have bound him, even Hera and Poseidon and Pallas Athene" (Iliad I.566-568, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il7-wall]: "Seest thou not how the flowing-haired Achaians have now again built them a wall before their ships, and drawn a foss around it, but gave not excellent hecatombs to the gods? Verily the fame thereof shall reach as far as the dawn spreadeth, and men will forget the wall that I and Phoebus Apollo built with travail for the hero Laomedon" (Iliad VII.4370-4376)
[^il7-zeus-reply]: "thine shall be the fame as far as the dawn spreadeth. Go to now, hereafter when the flowing-haired Achaians be departed upon their ships to their dear native land, then burst thou this wall asunder and scatter it all into the sea, and cover the great sea-beach over with sand again, that the great wall of the Achaians be brought to naught" (Iliad VII.4381-4386)

### Poseidon's Intervention (Book XIII)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book XIII, Poseidon makes his most dramatic entrance. While [Zeus](zeus.md) looks away from Troy, Poseidon watches from Samothrace: "the mighty Earthshaker held no blind watch, who sat and marvelled on the war and strife, high on the topmost crest of wooded Samothrace, for thence all Ida was plain to see; and plain to see were the city of Priam, and the ships of the Achaians... and he had pity on the Achaians... and strong was his anger against Zeus."[^il13-watch]

He descends to his undersea palace: "Three strides he made, and with the fourth he reached his goal, even Aigae, and there was his famous palace in the deeps of the mere, his glistering golden mansions builded, imperishable for ever." He harnesses "bronze-hooved horses, swift of flight, clothed with their golden manes," takes a "well-wrought lash of gold," and drives across the waves: "the sea beasts frolicked beneath him, on all sides out of the deeps, for well they knew their lord, and with gladness the sea stood asunder, and swiftly they sped, and the axle of bronze was not wetted beneath."[^il13-chariot]

He then intervenes in disguise — first as the seer Kalchas, urging the two Aiantes and striking them with his staff to fill them with courage. Aias of Oileus recognises him: "easily I knew the tokens of his feet and knees as he turned away, and the gods are easy to discern."[^il13-kalchas] Later he appears as Thoas to spur Idomeneus. He also directly protects fighters: he "did guard on every side the son of Nestor, even in the midst of the javelins" and "made his shaft of no avail, grudging him the life of Antilochos."[^il13-antilochos] He paralyzes Alkathoos for Idomeneus, "throwing a spell over his shining eyes, and snaring his glorious limbs."[^il13-spell]

The poem frames the conflict in theological terms: "the two mighty sons of Kronos, with contending will, were contriving sorrow and anguish for the heroes... both were of the same lineage and the same place of birth, but Zeus was the elder and the wiser. Therefore also Poseidon avoided to give open aid, but secretly ever he spurred them on."[^il13-brothers]

Poseidon is also moved by family grief: "Poseidon wroth at heart, when his son's son fell in the terrible fray" — his grandson Amphimachos (through his son Kteatos).[^il13-grandson]

[^il13-watch]: "the mighty Earthshaker held no blind watch, who sat and marvelled on the war and strife, high on the topmost crest of wooded Samothrace, for thence all Ida was plain to see; and plain to see were the city of Priam, and the ships of the Achaians. Thither did he go from the sea and sate him down, and he had pity on the Achaians, that they were subdued to the Trojans, and strong was his anger against Zeus" (Iliad XIII.7412-7417, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il13-chariot]: "Three strides he made, and with the fourth he reached his goal, even Aigae, and there was his famous palace in the deeps of the mere, his glistering golden mansions builded, imperishable for ever. Thither went he, and let harness to the car his bronze-hooved horses, swift of flight, clothed with their golden manes. He girt his own golden array about his body, and seized the well-wrought lash of gold, and mounted his chariot, and forth he drove across the waves. And the sea beasts frolicked beneath him, on all sides out of the deeps, for well they knew their lord, and with gladness the sea stood asunder" (Iliad XIII.7421-7431)
[^il13-kalchas]: "since it is one of the gods who hold Olympus, that in the semblance of a seer commands us now to fight beside the ships—not Kalchas is he, the prophet and soothsayer, for easily I knew the tokens of his feet and knees as he turned away, and the gods are easy to discern" (Iliad XIII.7470-7473)
[^il13-antilochos]: "Poseidon, the Shaker of the earth, did guard on every side the son of Nestor, even in the midst of the javelins... Poseidon of the dark locks made his shaft of no avail, grudging him the life of Antilochos" (Iliad XIII.7932-7941)
[^il13-spell]: "Poseidon subdue to Idomeneus, throwing a spell over his shining eyes, and snaring his glorious limbs; so that he might neither flee backwards, nor avoid the stroke, but stood steady as a pillar" (Iliad XIII.7821-7824)
[^il13-brothers]: "the two mighty sons of Kronos, with contending will, were contriving sorrow and anguish for the heroes. Zeus desired victory for the Trojans and Hector, giving glory to swift-footed Achilles; yet he did not wish the Achaian host to perish utterly before Ilios... But Poseidon went among the Argives and stirred them to war, stealing secretly forth from the grey salt sea... Verily both were of the same lineage and the same place of birth, but Zeus was the elder and the wiser. Therefore also Poseidon avoided to give open aid" (Iliad XIII.7737-7747)
[^il13-grandson]: "Then verily was Poseidon wroth at heart, when his son's son fell in the terrible fray" (Iliad XIII.7601)

- **[Iliad](../sources/iliad.md)** XII: Destroys the Achaian wall after the war with Apollo — "the Shaker of the earth, with his trident in his hands, was himself the leader"; washed all smooth with the Hellespont
- **[Iliad](../sources/iliad.md)** XIII: Most extended intervention — watches from Samothrace; descends in three strides to his golden palace at Aigae; drives golden chariot across the waves (sea beasts frolic, sea parts); disguised as Kalchas and Thoas; strikes Aiantes with staff; protects Antilochos; paralyzes Alkathoos; grief for grandson Amphimachos; "both were of the same lineage... but Zeus was the elder and the wiser"
- **[Iliad](../sources/iliad.md)** XIV: Disguised as old man, takes Agamemnon's hand; shouts as "nine thousand men, or ten thousand"; while Zeus sleeps, leads openly "with a dread sword of fine edge in his strong hand, like unto lightning"; turns the battle
- **[Iliad](../sources/iliad.md)** XV: The Three Lots speech — "Three brethren are we, and sons of Kronos... in three lots are all things divided"; the sea fell to him, darkness to Hades, heaven to Zeus, "earth and high Olympus are yet common to all"; yields to Zeus's command but warns of inappeasable wrath if Troy is spared
- **[Iliad](../sources/iliad.md)** XX: Cosmic earthquake — "from beneath Poseidon made the vast earth shake"; Hades terrified his realm will be exposed; saves Aineias (despite being pro-Greek) and prophesies his dynasty: "the might of Aineias [shall] reign among the Trojans, and his children's children"; Dardanos loved by Zeus above all mortal sons
- **[Iliad](../sources/iliad.md)** XXI: Saves Achilles from the River (with Athena, in likeness of men); challenges Apollo — expanded Laomedon account: "I round their city built the Trojans a wall... and thou Phoebus, didst herd shambling crook-horned kine among the spurs of woody many-folded Ida"; Laomedon cheated them of their hire
- **[Iliad](../sources/iliad.md)** XXIV: Opposes returning Hector's body (with Hera and Athena) — still angry about the Judgment of Paris
