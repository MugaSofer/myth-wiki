## Epithets

- "the earth-holder who shakes the earth" (Theogony 15)

## Mythology

Poseidon "fixed gates of bronze upon" [Tartarus](../places/tartarus.md) to imprison the [Titans](titans.md), "and a wall runs all round it on every side."[^theog-gates]

He lay with [Medusa](../creatures/gorgons.md) "in a soft meadow amid spring flowers," and from her slain body sprang [Pegasus](../creatures/pegasus.md) and Chrysaor.[^theog-medusa]

With Amphitrite, he fathered "great, wide-ruling Triton, and he owns the depths of the sea, living with his dear mother and the lord his father in their golden house, an awful god."[^theog-triton]

He made Briareos (one of the [Hundred-Handers](../creatures/hundred-handers.md)) "his son-in-law, giving him Cymopolea his daughter to wed."[^theog-briareos]

[^theog-gates]: "Poseidon fixed gates of bronze upon it, and a wall runs all round it on every side" (Theogony 732-733, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^theog-medusa]: "With her lay the Dark-haired One in a soft meadow amid spring flowers" (Theogony 278-279)
[^theog-triton]: "of Amphitrite and the loud-roaring Earth-Shaker was born great, wide-ruling Triton, and he owns the depths of the sea, living with his dear mother and the lord his father in their golden house, an awful god" (Theogony 930-933)
[^theog-briareos]: "Briareos, being goodly, the deep-roaring Earth-Shaker made his son-in-law, giving him Cymopolea his daughter to wed" (Theogony 817-819)

## In the Iliad

### The Binding of Zeus (Book I)

Poseidon is named as one of three Olympians — along with [Hera](hera.md) and [Athena](athena.md) — who conspired to bind [Zeus](zeus.md), thwarted when [Thetis](thetis.md) summoned [Briareus](../creatures/hundred-handers.md) of the hundred arms.[^il1-binding]

### Jealous of the Achaian Wall (Book VII)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book VII, Poseidon complains to [Zeus](zeus.md) about the Greeks' new wall: "is there any man throughout the boundless earth that will any more declare to the immortals his mind and counsel? Seest thou not how the flowing-haired Achaians have now again built them a wall before their ships, and drawn a foss around it, but gave not excellent hecatombs to the gods? Verily the fame thereof shall reach as far as the dawn spreadeth, and men will forget the wall that I and Phoebus [Apollo](apollo.md) built with travail for the hero Laomedon."[^il7-wall]

Zeus reassures him: "thine shall be the fame as far as the dawn spreadeth. Go to now, hereafter when the flowing-haired Achaians be departed upon their ships to their dear native land, then burst thou this wall asunder and scatter it all into the sea, and cover the great sea-beach over with sand again, that the great wall of the Achaians be brought to naught."[^il7-zeus-reply]

This passage reveals that Poseidon and Apollo once built Troy's walls under forced service to the mortal king Laomedon — and that Poseidon is sensitive about mortal constructions rivalling divine ones.

[^il1-binding]: "all the other Olympians would have bound him, even Hera and Poseidon and Pallas Athene" (Iliad I.566-568, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il7-wall]: "Seest thou not how the flowing-haired Achaians have now again built them a wall before their ships, and drawn a foss around it, but gave not excellent hecatombs to the gods? Verily the fame thereof shall reach as far as the dawn spreadeth, and men will forget the wall that I and Phoebus Apollo built with travail for the hero Laomedon" (Iliad VII.4370-4376)
[^il7-zeus-reply]: "thine shall be the fame as far as the dawn spreadeth. Go to now, hereafter when the flowing-haired Achaians be departed upon their ships to their dear native land, then burst thou this wall asunder and scatter it all into the sea, and cover the great sea-beach over with sand again, that the great wall of the Achaians be brought to naught" (Iliad VII.4381-4386)
