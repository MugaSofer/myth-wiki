## Appearance

The most vivid description comes in [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book XIII, where Poseidon makes his grand descent: "Three strides he made, and with the fourth he reached his goal, even Aigae, and there was his famous palace in the deeps of the mere, his glistering golden mansions builded, imperishable for ever." He harnesses "bronze-hooved horses, swift of flight, clothed with their golden manes," takes "the well-wrought lash of gold," and dons golden armour. As he drives across the waves, "the sea beasts frolicked beneath him, on all sides out of the deeps, for well they knew their lord, and with gladness the sea stood asunder, and swiftly they sped, and the axle of bronze was not wetted beneath."[^desc-chariot]

In Book XIV, fighting openly while [Zeus](zeus.md) sleeps, he carries "a dread sword of fine edge in his strong hand, like unto lightning."[^desc-sword]

[^desc-chariot]: "Three strides he made, and with the fourth he reached his goal, even Aigae, and there was his famous palace in the deeps of the mere, his glistering golden mansions builded, imperishable for ever. Thither went he, and let harness to the car his bronze-hooved horses, swift of flight, clothed with their golden manes. He girt his own golden array about his body, and seized the well-wrought lash of gold, and mounted his chariot, and forth he drove across the waves. And the sea beasts frolicked beneath him, on all sides out of the deeps, for well they knew their lord, and with gladness the sea stood asunder" (Iliad 13.26-36, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^desc-sword]: "The Shaker of the earth led them, wielding in his strong hand a dread sword of fine edge in his strong hand, like unto lightning, wherewith it is not permitted that any should mingle in deadly battle, but fear keepeth men therefrom" (Iliad 14.467-470)

## Powers

- **Earthquakes:** "From beneath Poseidon made the vast earth shake, and the steep tops of the mountains," so that even [Hades](hades.md) "leapt from his throne and cried aloud, in terror lest the earth-shaker Poseidon rend the earth asunder from above."[^desc-earthquake]
- **Sea mastery:** The sea parts before him and sea beasts frolic in recognition; he drives his golden chariot unwetted across the waves.[^desc-chariot]
- **Voice:** He shouts with a voice "as of nine thousand men, or ten thousand" when he leads the Greeks openly.[^desc-voice]
- **Disguise:** He appears as the seer Kalchas and as Thoas in Book XIII, and as an old man taking Agamemnon's hand in Book XIV. Aias recognises him: "easily I knew the tokens of his feet and knees as he turned away, and the gods are easy to discern."[^desc-disguise]
- **Spells and protection:** He paralyzes Alkathoos for Idomeneus, "throwing a spell over his shining eyes, and snaring his glorious limbs." He also shields Antilochos from javelins on all sides.[^desc-spell]
- **Destruction:** With his trident, he leads the destruction of the Achaian wall after the war, sending "all the foundations of beams and stones" into the waves and making "all smooth by the strong current of the Hellespont."[^desc-trident]

[^desc-earthquake]: "from beneath Poseidon made the vast earth shake, and the steep tops of the mountains. All the roots of many-fountained Ida were shaken, and all her crests, and the city of the Trojans, and the ships of the Achaians. And Aidoneus, lord of the dead below, had terror and leapt from his throne and cried aloud, in terror lest the earth-shaker Poseidon rend the earth asunder from above" (Iliad 20.115-122)
[^desc-voice]: "loudly he shouted, with might as of nine thousand men, or ten thousand" (Iliad 14.466-467)
[^desc-disguise]: "easily I knew the tokens of his feet and knees as he turned away, and the gods are easy to discern" (Iliad 13.79-80)
[^desc-spell]: "Poseidon subdue to Idomeneus, throwing a spell over his shining eyes, and snaring his glorious limbs; so that he might neither flee backwards, nor avoid the stroke, but stood steady as a pillar" (Iliad 13.441-444)
[^desc-trident]: "the Shaker of the earth, with his trident in his hands, was himself the leader, and sent forth into the waves all the foundations of beams and stones that the Achaians had laid with toil, and made all smooth by the strong current of the Hellespont" (Iliad 12.31-36)

## Mythology

Poseidon "fixed gates of bronze upon" [Tartarus](../places/tartarus.md) to imprison the [Titans](groups/titans.md), "and a wall runs all round it on every side."[^theog-gates]

He lay with [Medusa](../creatures/gorgons.md) "in a soft meadow amid spring flowers," and from her slain body sprang [Pegasus](../creatures/pegasus.md) and Chrysaor.[^theog-medusa]

With Amphitrite, he fathered "great, wide-ruling Triton, and he owns the depths of the sea, living with his dear mother and the lord his father in their golden house, an awful god."[^theog-triton]

He made Briareos (one of the [Hundred-Handers](../creatures/hundred-handers.md)) "his son-in-law, giving him Cymopolea his daughter to wed."[^theog-briareos]

[^theog-gates]: "Poseidon fixed gates of bronze upon it, and a wall runs all round it on every side" (Theogony 732-733, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^theog-medusa]: "With her lay the Dark-haired One in a soft meadow amid spring flowers" (Theogony 278-279)

[^theog-briareos]: "Briareos, being goodly, the deep-roaring Earth-Shaker made his son-in-law, giving him Cymopolea his daughter to wed" (Theogony 817-819)

## In the Odyssey

### Wrath Over Polyphemus (Book I)

In the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md), Poseidon is Odysseus's primary divine antagonist. "All the gods had pity on him save Poseidon, who raged continually against godlike Odysseus, till he came to his own country."[^od1-rage]

[Zeus](zeus.md) explains the source of his anger: "it is Poseidon, the girdler of the earth, that hath been wroth continually with quenchless anger for the Cyclops' sake whom he blinded of his eye, even godlike Polyphemus whose power is mightiest amongst all the Cyclôpes. His mother was the nymph Thoösa, daughter of Phorcys, lord of the unharvested sea, and in the hollow caves she lay with Poseidon."[^od1-polyphemus]

Poseidon does not seek to kill Odysseus outright: "From that day forth Poseidon the earth-shaker doth not indeed slay Odysseus, but driveth him wandering from his own country."[^od1-wandering] Zeus observes that Poseidon "will in no wise be able to strive alone against all, in despite of all the deathless gods."[^od1-alone]

At the opening of the poem, Poseidon is absent from the divine council: "Poseidon had now departed for the distant Ethiopians, the Ethiopians that are sundered in twain, the uttermost of men... There he looked to receive his hecatomb of bulls and rams."[^od1-ethiopia]

### Destroying Locrian Aias (Book IV)

In Menelaus's account of Proteus's prophecy, Poseidon's dual nature is vividly shown. He first saves Aias (the Locrian, son of Oileus) from the sea: "Poseidon at first brought him nigh to Gyrae, to the mighty rocks, and delivered him from the sea." But when Aias boasted blasphemously — "he said that in the gods' despite he had escaped the great gulf of the sea" — Poseidon responded with devastating force: "Poseidon heard his loud boasting, and presently caught up his trident into his strong hands, and smote the rock Gyraean and cleft it in twain... and the rock bore him down into the vast and heaving deep."[^od4-aias]

[^od4-aias]: "Poseidon at first brought him nigh to Gyrae, to the mighty rocks, and delivered him from the sea. And so he would have fled his doom, albeit hated by Athene, had he not let a proud word fall in the fatal darkening of his heart. He said that in the gods' despite he had escaped the great gulf of the sea; and Poseidon heard his loud boasting, and presently caught up his trident into his strong hands, and smote the rock Gyraean and cleft it in twain." (Odyssey 4.495-502, trans. Butcher and Lang)

[^od1-rage]: "all the gods had pity on him save Poseidon, who raged continually against godlike Odysseus, till he came to his own country" (Odyssey 1.27-29, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od1-polyphemus]: "it is Poseidon, the girdler of the earth, that hath been wroth continually with quenchless anger for the Cyclops' sake whom he blinded of his eye, even godlike Polyphemus whose power is mightiest amongst all the Cyclôpes. His mother was the nymph Thoösa, daughter of Phorcys, lord of the unharvested sea, and in the hollow caves she lay with Poseidon." (Odyssey 1.73-77, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od1-wandering]: "From that day forth Poseidon the earth-shaker doth not indeed slay Odysseus, but driveth him wandering from his own country" (Odyssey 1.77-78, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od1-alone]: "Poseidon let go his displeasure, for he will in no wise be able to strive alone against all, in despite of all the deathless gods" (Odyssey 1.80-82, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od1-ethiopia]: "Poseidon had now departed for the distant Ethiopians, the Ethiopians that are sundered in twain, the uttermost of men, abiding some where Hyperion sinks and some where he rises. There he looked to receive his hecatomb of bulls and rams" (Odyssey 1.29-33, trans. Butcher and Lang)

### Poseidon and Tyro (Book XI)

In the catalogue of heroines, Tyro loved the river Enipeus, and Poseidon seduced her in Enipeus's form: "the girdler of the world, the Earth-shaker, put on the shape of the god, and lay by the lady at the mouths of the whirling stream. Then the dark wave stood around them like a hill-side bowed, and hid the god and the mortal woman." He told her: "Woman, be glad in our love, and when the year comes round thou shalt give birth to glorious children,—for not weak are the embraces of the gods... behold, I am Poseidon, shaker of the earth." She bore Pelias and Neleus.[^od11-tyro]

Also in the catalogue, Iphimedeia "said that she had lain with Poseidon, and she bare children twain... godlike Otus and far-famed Ephialtes" — the giants who tried to pile mountains to reach Olympus.[^od11-iphimedeia]

[^od11-tyro]: "the girdler of the world, the Earth-shaker, put on the shape of the god, and lay by the lady at the mouths of the whirling stream. Then the dark wave stood around them like a hill-side bowed, and hid the god and the mortal woman... Woman, be glad in our love, and when the year comes round thou shalt give birth to glorious children,—for not weak are the embraces of the gods... behold, I am Poseidon, shaker of the earth" (Odyssey 11.234-251, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od11-iphimedeia]: "said that she had lain with Poseidon, and she bare children twain... godlike Otus and far-famed Ephialtes" (Odyssey 11.302-314, trans. Butcher and Lang)

### Polyphemus's Prayer (Book IX)

After Odysseus blinds [Polyphemus](../creatures/cyclopes.md), the Cyclops prays to his father: "Hear me, Poseidon, girdler of the earth, god of the dark hair, if indeed I be thine, and thou avowest thee my sire,—grant that he may never come to his home, even Odysseus, waster of cities, the son of Laertes, whose dwelling is in Ithaca; yet if he is ordained to see his friends and come unto his well-builded house, and his own country, late may he come in evil case, with the loss of all his company, in the ship of strangers, and find sorrows in his house." And "the god of the dark locks heard him."[^od9-prayer]

This prayer — which Poseidon grants — exactly describes the course of Odysseus's return: arriving late, alone, on a Phaeacian ship, to find his house beset by suitors.

[^od9-prayer]: "Hear me, Poseidon, girdler of the earth, god of the dark hair, if indeed I be thine, and thou avowest thee my sire,—grant that he may never come to his home, even Odysseus, waster of cities, the son of Laertes, whose dwelling is in Ithaca; yet if he is ordained to see his friends and come unto his well-builded house, and his own country, late may he come in evil case, with the loss of all his company, in the ship of strangers, and find sorrows in his house... So he spake in prayer, and the god of the dark locks heard him" (Odyssey 9.523-532, trans. Butcher and Lang)

### The Storm (Book V)

Returning from the Ethiopians, Poseidon spots Odysseus near Phaeacia: "the lord, the shaker of the earth, on his way from the Ethiopians espied him afar off from the mountains of the Solymi... and he was mightily angered in spirit." He declares: "methinks, that even yet I will drive him far enough in the path of suffering."[^od5-espied]

He then unleashes a full storm: "he gathered the clouds and troubled the waters of the deep, grasping his trident in his hands; and he roused all storms of all manner of winds, and shrouded in clouds the land and sea: and down sped night from heaven."[^od5-storm] He smashes Odysseus's raft with a great wave, then departs with a final pronouncement: "Even so, after all thy sufferings, go wandering over the deep, till thou shalt come among a people, the fosterlings of Zeus. Yet for all that I deem not that thou shalt think thyself too lightly afflicted."[^od5-depart]

[^od5-espied]: "the lord, the shaker of the earth, on his way from the Ethiopians espied him afar off from the mountains of the Solymi: even thence he saw Odysseus as he sailed over the deep; and he was mightily angered in spirit" (Odyssey 5.280-283, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od5-storm]: "he gathered the clouds and troubled the waters of the deep, grasping his trident in his hands; and he roused all storms of all manner of winds, and shrouded in clouds the land and sea: and down sped night from heaven" (Odyssey 5.290-293)
[^od5-depart]: "Even so, after all thy sufferings, go wandering over the deep, till thou shalt come among a people, the fosterlings of Zeus. Yet for all that I deem not that thou shalt think thyself too lightly afflicted" (Odyssey 5.379-382)

### Punishment of the Phaeacians (Book XIII)

When Poseidon discovers that the Phaeacians have safely conveyed Odysseus home to Ithaca, he is outraged. He complains to [Zeus](zeus.md): "Father Zeus, I for one shall no longer be of worship among the deathless gods, when mortal men hold me in no regard, even Phaeacians, who moreover are of mine own lineage."[^od13-complaint] Zeus gives him free rein: "Do thou as thou wilt, and as seems thee good."[^od13-zeus]

Poseidon strikes as the Phaeacian ship returns to Scheria: "he smote her into a stone, and rooted her far below with the down-stroke of his hand."[^od13-stone] King Alcinous recognises the fulfilment of an ancient oracle — that Poseidon would one day punish the Phaeacians, "for that we give safe escort to all men."[^od13-oracle] In response, the Phaeacians offer twelve chosen bulls to appease him.[^od13-bulls]

This episode completes the arc begun in Books V and VIII: Poseidon's wrath, unable to prevent Odysseus's return, falls instead on those who aided it. The Phaeacians — his own descendants through Nausithous — are punished not for opposing him, but for rendering his opposition meaningless.

[^od13-complaint]: "Father Zeus, I for one shall no longer be of worship among the deathless gods, when mortal men hold me in no regard, even Phaeacians, who moreover are of mine own lineage" (Odyssey 13.128-131, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od13-zeus]: "Do thou as thou wilt, and as seems thee good" (Odyssey 13.144-145, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od13-stone]: "he smote her into a stone, and rooted her far below with the down-stroke of his hand" (Odyssey 13.164-166, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od13-oracle]: "jealous of us, for that we give safe escort to all men" (Odyssey 13.179-180, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od13-bulls]: "let us sacrifice to him twelve chosen bulls, if perchance he may take pity, and not overshadow our city with a long mountain" (Odyssey 13.186-191, trans. Butcher and Lang)

## In the Iliad

### The Binding of Zeus (Book I)

Poseidon is named as one of three Olympians — along with [Hera](hera.md) and [Athena](athena.md) — who conspired to bind [Zeus](zeus.md), thwarted when [Thetis](thetis.md) summoned [Briareus](../creatures/hundred-handers.md) of the hundred arms.[^il1-binding]

### Jealous of the Achaian Wall (Book VII)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book VII, Poseidon complains to [Zeus](zeus.md) about the Greeks' new wall: "is there any man throughout the boundless earth that will any more declare to the immortals his mind and counsel? Seest thou not how the flowing-haired Achaians have now again built them a wall before their ships, and drawn a foss around it, but gave not excellent hecatombs to the gods? Verily the fame thereof shall reach as far as the dawn spreadeth, and men will forget the wall that I and Phoebus [Apollo](apollo.md) built with travail for the hero Laomedon."[^il7-wall]

Zeus reassures him: "thine shall be the fame as far as the dawn spreadeth. Go to now, hereafter when the flowing-haired Achaians be departed upon their ships to their dear native land, then burst thou this wall asunder and scatter it all into the sea, and cover the great sea-beach over with sand again, that the great wall of the Achaians be brought to naught."[^il7-zeus-reply]

This passage reveals that Poseidon and Apollo once built Troy's walls under forced service to the mortal king Laomedon — and that Poseidon is sensitive about mortal constructions rivalling divine ones.

### Destroying the Achaian Wall (Book XII)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book XII, the poem describes how, after the war ended, Poseidon and [Apollo](apollo.md) fulfilled the promise from Book VII: "Poseidon and Apollo took counsel to wash away the wall, bringing in the might of the rivers, of all that flow from the hills of Ida to the sea." Apollo "turned together" the mouths of nine rivers and "for nine days he drave their stream against the wall; and still [Zeus](zeus.md) rained unceasingly." Meanwhile "the Shaker of the earth, with his trident in his hands, was himself the leader, and sent forth into the waves all the foundations of beams and stones that the Achaians had laid with toil, and made all smooth by the strong current of the Hellespont, and covered again the great beach with sand."[^il12-wall]

[^il12-wall]: "Poseidon and Apollo took counsel to wash away the wall, bringing in the might of the rivers... the mouths of all these waters did Phoebus Apollo turn together, and for nine days he drave their stream against the wall; and still Zeus rained unceasingly, that the quicker he might mingle the wall with the salt sea. And the Shaker of the earth, with his trident in his hands, was himself the leader, and sent forth into the waves all the foundations of beams and stones that the Achaians had laid with toil, and made all smooth by the strong current of the Hellespont, and covered again the great beach with sand, when he had swept away the wall" (Iliad 12.21-36, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

[^il1-binding]: "all the other Olympians would have bound him, even Hera and Poseidon and Pallas Athene" (Iliad 1.391-393, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il7-wall]: "Seest thou not how the flowing-haired Achaians have now again built them a wall before their ships, and drawn a foss around it, but gave not excellent hecatombs to the gods? Verily the fame thereof shall reach as far as the dawn spreadeth, and men will forget the wall that I and Phoebus Apollo built with travail for the hero Laomedon" (Iliad 7.442-449)
[^il7-zeus-reply]: "thine shall be the fame as far as the dawn spreadeth. Go to now, hereafter when the flowing-haired Achaians be departed upon their ships to their dear native land, then burst thou this wall asunder and scatter it all into the sea, and cover the great sea-beach over with sand again, that the great wall of the Achaians be brought to naught" (Iliad 7.454-459)

### Poseidon's Intervention (Book XIII)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book XIII, Poseidon makes his most dramatic entrance. While [Zeus](zeus.md) looks away from Troy, Poseidon watches from Samothrace: "the mighty Earthshaker held no blind watch, who sat and marvelled on the war and strife, high on the topmost crest of wooded Samothrace, for thence all Ida was plain to see; and plain to see were the city of Priam, and the ships of the Achaians... and he had pity on the Achaians... and strong was his anger against Zeus."[^il13-watch]

He descends to his undersea palace: "Three strides he made, and with the fourth he reached his goal, even Aigae, and there was his famous palace in the deeps of the mere, his glistering golden mansions builded, imperishable for ever." He harnesses "bronze-hooved horses, swift of flight, clothed with their golden manes," takes a "well-wrought lash of gold," and drives across the waves: "the sea beasts frolicked beneath him, on all sides out of the deeps, for well they knew their lord, and with gladness the sea stood asunder, and swiftly they sped, and the axle of bronze was not wetted beneath."[^il13-chariot]

He then intervenes in disguise — first as the seer Kalchas, urging the two Aiantes and striking them with his staff to fill them with courage. Aias of Oileus recognises him: "easily I knew the tokens of his feet and knees as he turned away, and the gods are easy to discern."[^il13-kalchas] Later he appears as Thoas to spur Idomeneus. He also directly protects fighters: he "did guard on every side the son of Nestor, even in the midst of the javelins" and "made his shaft of no avail, grudging him the life of Antilochos."[^il13-antilochos] He paralyzes Alkathoos for Idomeneus, "throwing a spell over his shining eyes, and snaring his glorious limbs."[^il13-spell]

The poem frames the conflict in theological terms: "the two mighty sons of Kronos, with contending will, were contriving sorrow and anguish for the heroes... both were of the same lineage and the same place of birth, but Zeus was the elder and the wiser. Therefore also Poseidon avoided to give open aid, but secretly ever he spurred them on."[^il13-brothers]

Poseidon is also moved by family grief: "Poseidon wroth at heart, when his son's son fell in the terrible fray" — his grandson Amphimachos (through his son Kteatos).[^il13-grandson]

[^il13-watch]: "the mighty Earthshaker held no blind watch, who sat and marvelled on the war and strife, high on the topmost crest of wooded Samothrace, for thence all Ida was plain to see; and plain to see were the city of Priam, and the ships of the Achaians. Thither did he go from the sea and sate him down, and he had pity on the Achaians, that they were subdued to the Trojans, and strong was his anger against Zeus" (Iliad 13.17-22, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il13-chariot]: "Three strides he made, and with the fourth he reached his goal, even Aigae, and there was his famous palace in the deeps of the mere, his glistering golden mansions builded, imperishable for ever. Thither went he, and let harness to the car his bronze-hooved horses, swift of flight, clothed with their golden manes. He girt his own golden array about his body, and seized the well-wrought lash of gold, and mounted his chariot, and forth he drove across the waves. And the sea beasts frolicked beneath him, on all sides out of the deeps, for well they knew their lord, and with gladness the sea stood asunder" (Iliad 13.26-36)
[^il13-kalchas]: "since it is one of the gods who hold Olympus, that in the semblance of a seer commands us now to fight beside the ships—not Kalchas is he, the prophet and soothsayer, for easily I knew the tokens of his feet and knees as he turned away, and the gods are easy to discern" (Iliad 13.77-80)
[^il13-antilochos]: "Poseidon, the Shaker of the earth, did guard on every side the son of Nestor, even in the midst of the javelins... Poseidon of the dark locks made his shaft of no avail, grudging him the life of Antilochos" (Iliad 13.557-566)
[^il13-spell]: "Poseidon subdue to Idomeneus, throwing a spell over his shining eyes, and snaring his glorious limbs; so that he might neither flee backwards, nor avoid the stroke, but stood steady as a pillar" (Iliad 13.441-444)
[^il13-brothers]: "the two mighty sons of Kronos, with contending will, were contriving sorrow and anguish for the heroes. Zeus desired victory for the Trojans and Hector, giving glory to swift-footed Achilles; yet he did not wish the Achaian host to perish utterly before Ilios... But Poseidon went among the Argives and stirred them to war, stealing secretly forth from the grey salt sea... Verily both were of the same lineage and the same place of birth, but Zeus was the elder and the wiser. Therefore also Poseidon avoided to give open aid" (Iliad 13.354-365)
[^il13-grandson]: "Then verily was Poseidon wroth at heart, when his son's son fell in the terrible fray" (Iliad 13.213)

## In the Fabulae

### Laomedon and Troy's Walls (§89)

The [Fabulae](../sources/hyginus.md) tells how Poseidon (Neptune) and [Apollo](apollo.md) built Troy's walls. "Neptune and Apollo are said to have built a wall around Troy."[^hyg-89-wall] King Laomedon made a vow: "he would sacrifice to them from his flocks whatever should be born that year in his kingdom."[^hyg-89-vow]

Laomedon broke his promise: "This vow he defaulted on through avarice. Other writers say that he promised too little."[^hyg-89-default] Poseidon's punishment was severe: "Neptune sent a sea-monster to plague Troy, and for this reason the king sent to Apollo for advice."[^hyg-89-monster]

Apollo's oracle demanded human sacrifice: "Apollo angrily replied that if Trojan maidens were bound and offered to the monster, there would be an end to the plague. When many girls had been devoured, and the lot fell on Hesione, and she was bound to the rocks," [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) came and killed the monster.[^hyg-89-oracle] Heracles demanded Laomedon's horses "which walk over water standing ears of grain" as payment, but "Laomedon defaulted in this, too, and refused to give up Hesione."[^hyg-89-second]

The outcome was Troy's first sack: "Hercules, assembling ships to attack Troy, came and slew Laomedon, and gave the kingdom to his infant son Podarces, who was afterward called apo tou priasthai, 'from being redeemed,' Priam."[^hyg-89-priam]

[^hyg-89-wall]: "Neptune and Apollo are said to have built a wall around Troy." (Fabulae §89, trans. Mary Grant)

### Contest for Athens (§164)

See [Athena](athena.md) §164. Poseidon contested with Athena for patronage of Athens before [Zeus](zeus.md) as judge. Athena won by planting the olive. Poseidon "in anger, wanted to have the sea flood that land" but was forbidden by [Hermes](hermes.md) at Zeus's command.[^hyg-164-ref]

[^hyg-164-ref]: (Fabulae §164, trans. Mary Grant)

## In the [Argonautica](../sources/argonautica.md)

Poseidon is not a direct participant in the Argonautic expedition but is named as father of several Argonauts and significant figures. **Amycus**, the brutish king of the Bebrycians who was killed by Pollux in a boxing match, was Poseidon's son by the Bithynian nymph Melie.[^arg-pos-amycus] **Euphemus**, the Argonaut who could run across the surface of the sea without wetting his feet, was also Poseidon's son.[^arg-pos-euphemus] **Periclymenus** of Pylos, who had the gift of shapeshifting, received that power from Poseidon.[^arg-pos-periclymenus] **Ancaeus**, born near the waters of Imbrasus to Astypalaea and Poseidon, served as helmsman after Tiphys died.[^arg-pos-ancaeus]

Poseidon is also named as father of **Triton**, the sea-god who appeared in Lake Tritonis and guided the Argo back to the sea on the Libyan plain, taking the form of a young man and giving the Argonauts a clod of earth as an omen of their descendants settling Cyrene.[^arg-pos-triton]

[^arg-pos-amycus]: "whom once a nymph, Bithynian Melie, united to Poseidon Genethlius, bare the most arrogant of men" (Argonautica 2.4-5, trans. R.C. Seaton)
[^arg-pos-euphemus]: "Euphemus whom, most swift-footed of men, Europe, daughter of mighty Tityos, bare to Poseidon. He was wont to skim the swell of the grey sea, and wetted not his swift feet, but just dipping the tips of his toes was borne on the watery path" (Argonautica 1.179-182, trans. R.C. Seaton)
[^arg-pos-periclymenus]: "Neleian Periclymenus... eldest of all the sons of godlike Neleus who were born at Pylos; Poseidon had given him boundless strength and granted him that whatever shape he should crave during the fight, that he should take in the stress of battle" (Argonautica 1.156-160, trans. R.C. Seaton)
[^arg-pos-ancaeus]: "whom near the waters of Imbrasus Astypalaea bore to Poseidon; for especially was he skilled in steering" (Argonautica 1.187-188, trans. R.C. Seaton)
[^arg-pos-triton]: "my sire Poseidon has made me to be well versed in this sea. And I rule the shore" (Argonautica 4.1602-1603, trans. R.C. Seaton)

## In Euripides' [Hippolytus](../sources/euripides-hippolytus.md)

### Three Curses for Theseus

In the *Hippolytus*, Poseidon (Neptune) is the divine father whose gift to [Theseus](../heroes/theseus.md) drives the tragedy. [Aphrodite](aphrodite.md) reveals in the prologue that Poseidon "granted as a privilege to Theseus, that he should make no prayer thrice to the God in vain."[^eur-hip-privilege]

When Theseus believes Phaedra's false accusation against his son, he invokes the curse: "O father Neptune, by one of these three curses, which thou formerly didst promise me, by one of those destroy my son."[^eur-hip-invoke] Poseidon answers by sending a monstrous bull from the sea. A Messenger reports: "we beheld a vast wave pillared in heaven... the wave sent forth a bull, a fierce monster; with whose bellowing the whole land filled resounded fearfully."[^eur-hip-seabull] The bull pursues Hippolytus's chariot until it shatters and he is dragged to death.

The dying Hippolytus laments: "Oh! the bitter gifts of thy father Neptune!"[^eur-hip-bitter-gifts]

[^eur-hip-privilege]: "Neptune, king of the ocean, granted as a privilege to Theseus, that he should make no prayer thrice to the God in vain" (Hippolytus 44-46, trans. T.A. Buckley)
[^eur-hip-invoke]: "O father Neptune, by one of these three curses, which thou formerly didst promise me, by one of those destroy my son, and let him not escape beyond this day" (Hippolytus 887-890)
[^eur-hip-seabull]: "we beheld a vast wave pillared in heaven... the wave sent forth a bull, a fierce monster; with whose bellowing the whole land filled resounded fearfully" (Hippolytus 1206-1214)

## In the Bibliotheca (1.4.3-1.4.5, 1.6.2)

### Orion (1.4.3-1.4.4)

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) names Poseidon as Orion's father: "Pherecydes says that he was a son of Poseidon and Euryale. Poseidon bestowed on him the power of striding across the sea."[^apd-pos-orion]

When Orion sought vengeance on Oenopion for blinding him, "for him Poseidon had made ready a house under the earth constructed by [Hephaestus](hephaestus.md)," hiding Oenopion from his wrath.[^apd-pos-house]

### Marriage to Amphitrite (1.4.5)

"Poseidon wedded Amphitrite, daughter of Ocean, and there were born to him Triton and Rhode, who was married to the Sun."[^apd-pos-amphitrite]

> **NOTE:** The [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md) also names Amphitrite as mother of Triton (930-933) but does not mention Rhode. The Bibliotheca adds Rhode and specifies Amphitrite as a daughter of [Oceanus](oceanus.md) rather than [Nereus](nereus.md).

### Chasing Polybotes in the Gigantomachy (1.6.2)

During the battle with the [Giants](../creatures/giants.md), "Polybotes was chased through the sea by Poseidon and came to Cos; and Poseidon, breaking off that piece of the island which is called Nisyrum, threw it on him."[^apd-pos-polybotes]

[^apd-pos-orion]: "Pherecydes says that he was a son of Poseidon and Euryale. Poseidon bestowed on him the power of striding across the sea" (Bibliotheca 1.4.3, trans. Frazer)

## In the Bibliotheca (Book 2)

### Argive Affairs

Poseidon fathered twin sons Agenor and Belus through Libya (daughter of Epaphus): "Libya had by Poseidon twin sons, Agenor and Belus."[^apd-pos-libya] He dried up the Argive springs in a dispute with [Hera](hera.md): "the country being waterless, because Poseidon had dried up even the springs out of anger at Inachus for testifying that the land belonged to Hera."[^apd-pos-springs] He later rescued Amymone from a satyr and "revealed to her the springs at Lerna."[^apd-pos-amymone]

### Andromeda's Sea Monster

When Cassiepea boasted to be more beautiful than the Nereids, "Poseidon, sharing their wrath, sent a flood and a monster to invade the land." This led to [Andromeda](../heroes/andromeda.md) being exposed as prey until [Perseus](../heroes/perseus.md) rescued her.[^apd-pos-andromeda]

### Numerous Offspring

Book 2 names many sons of Poseidon: Pterelaus (made immortal with a golden hair), Taphius, Hippothoe's abductor, Chrysaor (father of Geryon, born alongside [Pegasus](../creatures/pegasus.md) from Medusa), Eryx of Sicily, and the Cretan bull "that Poseidon sent up from the sea when Minos promised to sacrifice to Poseidon what should appear out of the sea."[^apd-pos-bull]

### Troy's Walls

[Apollo](apollo.md) and Poseidon "assumed the likeness of men and undertook to fortify Pergamum for wages. But when they had fortified it, he would not pay them their wages. Therefore Apollo sent a pestilence, and Poseidon a sea monster."[^apd-pos-troy]

### Sheltering the Centaurs

During [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md)' pursuit of the centaurs, "the rest of them Poseidon received at Eleusis and hid them in a mountain."[^apd-pos-centaurs]

[^apd-pos-libya]: "Libya had by Poseidon twin sons, Agenor and Belus" (Bibliotheca 2.1.4, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-pos-springs]: "the country being waterless, because Poseidon had dried up even the springs out of anger at Inachus for testifying that the land belonged to Hera" (Bibliotheca 2.1.4)

[^apd-pos-andromeda]: "the Nereids were angry, and Poseidon, sharing their wrath, sent a flood and a monster to invade the land" (Bibliotheca 2.4.3)
[^apd-pos-bull]: "the bull that Poseidon sent up from the sea when Minos promised to sacrifice to Poseidon what should appear out of the sea. And they say that when he saw the beauty of the bull he sent it away to the herds and sacrificed another to Poseidon; at which the god was angry and made the bull savage" (Bibliotheca 2.5.7)
[^apd-pos-troy]: "Apollo and Poseidon assumed the likeness of men and undertook to fortify Pergamum for wages. But when they had fortified it, he would not pay them their wages. Therefore Apollo sent a pestilence, and Poseidon a sea monster" (Bibliotheca 2.5.9)
[^apd-pos-centaurs]: "the rest of them Poseidon received at Eleusis and hid them in a mountain" (Bibliotheca 2.5.4)

## In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md)

### The Flood (1.274-312)

Poseidon (Neptune) aids [Zeus](zeus.md) (Jupiter) in flooding the world. Zeus "brought to aid his azure brother, lord of flowing waves, who called upon the Rivers and the Streams." Neptune commanded: "A long appeal is needless; pour ye forth in rage of power; open up your fountains; rush over obstacles; let every stream pour forth in boundless floods."[^met-pos-flood] He then "with his trident smote the Earth, which trembling with unwonted throes heaved up the sources of her waters bare."[^met-pos-trident] When Zeus ended the punishment, "the Ocean ruler laid his trident down and pacified the waves, and called on azure Triton" to blow his shell and signal retreat to all the waters.[^met-pos-retreat]

### The Walls of Troy (11.194-237)

In Book XI, [Apollo](apollo.md) and Poseidon "assumed a mortal form: and those two gods agreed to labor for a sum of gold and built the mighty wall" of Troy for Laomedon. "But that false king refused all payment, adding perjury to his false bargaining." Poseidon "drove all his waters high upon the shores of Troy" and demanded the king's daughter Hesione as sacrifice to a sea-monster. [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) saved her, but Laomedon refused payment again, so Heracles "captured the twice-perjured walls of conquered Troy."[^met-pos-troy]

[^met-pos-flood]: "A long appeal is needless; pour ye forth in rage of power; open up your fountains; rush over obstacles; let every stream pour forth in boundless floods" (Metamorphoses 1.278-281, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-pos-trident]: "Neptune with his trident smote the Earth, which trembling with unwonted throes heaved up the sources of her waters bare" (Metamorphoses 1.283-284)

[^met-pos-troy]: "Neptune, enraged, said, 'You shall not escape your punishment.' And he drove all his waters high upon the shores of Troy... The daughter of the king was soon required as food for a sea-monster" (Metamorphoses 11.207-225)
[^apd-arion]: "Adrastus alone was saved by his horse Arion. That horse Poseidon begot on Demeter, when in the likeness of a Fury she consorted with him" (Bibliotheca 3.6.8, trans. J.G. Frazer)
