## Mythology

Poseidon "fixed gates of bronze upon" [Tartarus](../places/tartarus.md) to imprison the [Titans](titans.md), "and a wall runs all round it on every side."[^theog-gates]

He lay with [Medusa](../creatures/gorgons.md) "in a soft meadow amid spring flowers," and from her slain body sprang [Pegasus](../creatures/pegasus.md) and Chrysaor.[^theog-medusa]

With Amphitrite, he fathered "great, wide-ruling Triton, and he owns the depths of the sea, living with his dear mother and the lord his father in their golden house, an awful god."[^theog-triton]

He made Briareos (one of the [Hundred-Handers](../creatures/hundred-handers.md)) "his son-in-law, giving him Cymopolea his daughter to wed."[^theog-briareos]

[^theog-gates]: "Poseidon fixed gates of bronze upon it, and a wall runs all round it on every side" (Theogony 732-733, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^theog-medusa]: "With her lay the Dark-haired One in a soft meadow amid spring flowers" (Theogony 278-279)

## In the Iliad

### The Binding of Zeus (Book I)

Poseidon is named as one of three Olympians — along with [Hera](hera.md) and [Athena](athena.md) — who conspired to bind [Zeus](zeus.md), thwarted when [Thetis](thetis.md) summoned [Briareus](../creatures/hundred-handers.md) of the hundred arms.[^il1-binding]

### Jealous of the Achaian Wall (Book VII)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book VII, Poseidon complains to [Zeus](zeus.md) about the Greeks' new wall: "is there any man throughout the boundless earth that will any more declare to the immortals his mind and counsel? Seest thou not how the flowing-haired Achaians have now again built them a wall before their ships, and drawn a foss around it, but gave not excellent hecatombs to the gods? Verily the fame thereof shall reach as far as the dawn spreadeth, and men will forget the wall that I and Phoebus [Apollo](apollo.md) built with travail for the hero Laomedon."[^il7-wall]

Zeus reassures him: "thine shall be the fame as far as the dawn spreadeth. Go to now, hereafter when the flowing-haired Achaians be departed upon their ships to their dear native land, then burst thou this wall asunder and scatter it all into the sea, and cover the great sea-beach over with sand again, that the great wall of the Achaians be brought to naught."[^il7-zeus-reply]

This passage reveals that Poseidon and Apollo once built Troy's walls under forced service to the mortal king Laomedon — and that Poseidon is sensitive about mortal constructions rivalling divine ones.

### Destroying the Achaian Wall (Book XII)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book XII, the poem describes how, after the war ended, Poseidon and [Apollo](apollo.md) fulfilled the promise from Book VII: "Poseidon and Apollo took counsel to wash away the wall, bringing in the might of the rivers, of all that flow from the hills of Ida to the sea." Apollo "turned together" the mouths of nine rivers and "for nine days he drave their stream against the wall; and still [Zeus](zeus.md) rained unceasingly." Meanwhile "the Shaker of the earth, with his trident in his hands, was himself the leader, and sent forth into the waves all the foundations of beams and stones that the Achaians had laid with toil, and made all smooth by the strong current of the Hellespont, and covered again the great beach with sand."[^il12-wall]

[^il12-wall]: "Poseidon and Apollo took counsel to wash away the wall, bringing in the might of the rivers... the mouths of all these waters did Phoebus Apollo turn together, and for nine days he drave their stream against the wall; and still Zeus rained unceasingly, that the quicker he might mingle the wall with the salt sea. And the Shaker of the earth, with his trident in his hands, was himself the leader, and sent forth into the waves all the foundations of beams and stones that the Achaians had laid with toil, and made all smooth by the strong current of the Hellespont, and covered again the great beach with sand, when he had swept away the wall" (Iliad XII.6984-6998, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

[^il1-binding]: "all the other Olympians would have bound him, even Hera and Poseidon and Pallas Athene" (Iliad I.566-568, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il7-wall]: "Seest thou not how the flowing-haired Achaians have now again built them a wall before their ships, and drawn a foss around it, but gave not excellent hecatombs to the gods? Verily the fame thereof shall reach as far as the dawn spreadeth, and men will forget the wall that I and Phoebus Apollo built with travail for the hero Laomedon" (Iliad VII.4370-4376)
[^il7-zeus-reply]: "thine shall be the fame as far as the dawn spreadeth. Go to now, hereafter when the flowing-haired Achaians be departed upon their ships to their dear native land, then burst thou this wall asunder and scatter it all into the sea, and cover the great sea-beach over with sand again, that the great wall of the Achaians be brought to naught" (Iliad VII.4381-4386)

### Poseidon's Intervention (Book XIII)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book XIII, Poseidon makes his most dramatic entrance. While [Zeus](zeus.md) looks away from Troy, Poseidon watches from Samothrace: "the mighty Earthshaker held no blind watch, who sat and marvelled on the war and strife, high on the topmost crest of wooded Samothrace, for thence all Ida was plain to see; and plain to see were the city of Priam, and the ships of the Achaians... and he had pity on the Achaians... and strong was his anger against Zeus."[^il13-watch]

He descends to his undersea palace: "Three strides he made, and with the fourth he reached his goal, even Aigae, and there was his famous palace in the deeps of the mere, his glistering golden mansions builded, imperishable for ever." He harnesses "bronze-hooved horses, swift of flight, clothed with their golden manes," takes a "well-wrought lash of gold," and drives across the waves: "the sea beasts frolicked beneath him, on all sides out of the deeps, for well they knew their lord, and with gladness the sea stood asunder, and swiftly they sped, and the axle of bronze was not wetted beneath."[^il13-chariot]

He then intervenes in disguise — first as the seer Kalchas, urging the two Aiantes and striking them with his staff to fill them with courage. Aias of Oileus recognises him: "easily I knew the tokens of his feet and knees as he turned away, and the gods are easy to discern."[^il13-kalchas] Later he appears as Thoas to spur Idomeneus. He also directly protects fighters: he "did guard on every side the son of Nestor, even in the midst of the javelins" and "made his shaft of no avail, grudging him the life of Antilochos."[^il13-antilochos] He paralyzes Alkathoos for Idomeneus, "throwing a spell over his shining eyes, and snaring his glorious limbs."[^il13-spell]

The poem frames the conflict in theological terms: "the two mighty sons of Kronos, with contending will, were contriving sorrow and anguish for the heroes... both were of the same lineage and the same place of birth, but Zeus was the elder and the wiser. Therefore also Poseidon avoided to give open aid, but secretly ever he spurred them on."[^il13-brothers]

Poseidon is also moved by family grief: "Poseidon wroth at heart, when his son's son fell in the terrible fray" — his grandson Amphimachos (through his son Kteatos).[^il13-grandson]

[^il13-watch]: "the mighty Earthshaker held no blind watch, who sat and marvelled on the war and strife, high on the topmost crest of wooded Samothrace, for thence all Ida was plain to see; and plain to see were the city of Priam, and the ships of the Achaians. Thither did he go from the sea and sate him down, and he had pity on the Achaians, that they were subdued to the Trojans, and strong was his anger against Zeus" (Iliad XIII.7412-7417, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il13-chariot]: "Three strides he made, and with the fourth he reached his goal, even Aigae, and there was his famous palace in the deeps of the mere, his glistering golden mansions builded, imperishable for ever. Thither went he, and let harness to the car his bronze-hooved horses, swift of flight, clothed with their golden manes. He girt his own golden array about his body, and seized the well-wrought lash of gold, and mounted his chariot, and forth he drove across the waves. And the sea beasts frolicked beneath him, on all sides out of the deeps, for well they knew their lord, and with gladness the sea stood asunder" (Iliad XIII.7421-7431)
[^il13-kalchas]: "since it is one of the gods who hold Olympus, that in the semblance of a seer commands us now to fight beside the ships—not Kalchas is he, the prophet and soothsayer, for easily I knew the tokens of his feet and knees as he turned away, and the gods are easy to discern" (Iliad XIII.7470-7473)
[^il13-antilochos]: "Poseidon, the Shaker of the earth, did guard on every side the son of Nestor, even in the midst of the javelins... Poseidon of the dark locks made his shaft of no avail, grudging him the life of Antilochos" (Iliad XIII.7932-7941)
[^il13-spell]: "Poseidon subdue to Idomeneus, throwing a spell over his shining eyes, and snaring his glorious limbs; so that he might neither flee backwards, nor avoid the stroke, but stood steady as a pillar" (Iliad XIII.7821-7824)
[^il13-brothers]: "the two mighty sons of Kronos, with contending will, were contriving sorrow and anguish for the heroes. Zeus desired victory for the Trojans and Hector, giving glory to swift-footed Achilles; yet he did not wish the Achaian host to perish utterly before Ilios... But Poseidon went among the Argives and stirred them to war, stealing secretly forth from the grey salt sea... Verily both were of the same lineage and the same place of birth, but Zeus was the elder and the wiser. Therefore also Poseidon avoided to give open aid" (Iliad XIII.7737-7747)
[^il13-grandson]: "Then verily was Poseidon wroth at heart, when his son's son fell in the terrible fray" (Iliad XIII.7601)
