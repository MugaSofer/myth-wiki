## Overview

**Iapetus** is one of the [Titans](titans.md), father of [Prometheus](prometheus.md) and [Atlas](atlas.md).

## Birth

Listed among the children of [Gaia](gaia.md) and [Uranus](uranus.md): "she lay with Heaven and bare deep-swirling [Oceanus](oceanus.md), [Coeus](coeus.md) and [Crius](crius.md) and [Hyperion](hyperion.md) and Iapetus, [Theia](theia.md) and [Rhea](rhea.md), [Themis](themis.md) and [Mnemosyne](mnemosyne.md) and gold-crowned [Phoebe](phoebe.md) and lovely [Tethys](tethys.md)."[^theog-birth]

[^theog-birth]: "she lay with Heaven and bare deep-swirling Oceanus, Coeus and Crius and Hyperion and Iapetus, Theia and Rhea, Themis and Mnemosyne and gold-crowned Phoebe and lovely Tethys" (Theogony 132-136, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Children

"Now Iapetus took to wife the neat-ankled maid Clymene, daughter of [Ocean](oceanus.md), and went up with her into one bed. And she bare him a stout-hearted son, [Atlas](atlas.md): also she bare very glorious Menoetius and clever [Prometheus](prometheus.md), full of various wiles, and scatter-brained Epimetheus who from the first was a mischief to men who eat bread; for it was he who first took of [Zeus](zeus.md) the woman, the maiden whom he had formed."[^theog-children]

[^theog-children]: "Now Iapetus took to wife the neat-ankled maid Clymene, daughter of Ocean, and went up with her into one bed. And she bare him a stout-hearted son, Atlas: also she bare very glorious Menoetius and clever Prometheus, full of various wiles, and scatter-brained Epimetheus who from the first was a mischief to men who eat bread" (Theogony 507-514, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## In the Bibliotheca

Apollodorus names **Asia** (an Oceanid) as Iapetus's wife, rather than the Theogony's Clymene: "to Iapetus and Asia was born [Atlas](atlas.md), who has the sky on his shoulders, and [Prometheus](prometheus.md), and [Epimetheus](epimetheus.md), and [Menoetius](menoetius.md), he whom [Zeus](zeus.md) in the battle with the Titans smote with a thunderbolt and hurled down to Tartarus."[^apd-iapetus] This is a **variant tradition** — the Theogony gives Clymene, also a daughter of [Oceanus](oceanus.md), as the mother.

[^apd-iapetus]: "to Iapetus and Asia was born Atlas, who has the sky on his shoulders, and Prometheus, and Epimetheus, and Menoetius, he whom Zeus in the battle with the Titans smote with a thunderbolt and hurled down to Tartarus" (Bibliotheca 1.2.3, trans. Frazer)
