## Appearance

[Homeric Hymn XXXI](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) provides the most vivid physical description of any celestial deity: "As he rides in his chariot, he shines upon men and deathless gods, and piercingly he gazes with his eyes from his golden helmet. Bright rays beam dazzlingly from him, and his bright locks streaming from the temples of his head gracefully enclose his far-seen face: a rich, fine-spun garment glows upon his body and flutters in the wind: and stallions carry him."[^desc-appearance]

He rests at heaven's peak until he "marvellously drives them down again through heaven to Ocean," riding a **golden-yoked chariot**.[^desc-chariot]

[^desc-appearance]: "As he rides in his chariot, he shines upon men and deathless gods, and piercingly he gazes with his eyes from his golden helmet. Bright rays beam dazzlingly from him, and his bright locks streaming from the temples of his head gracefully enclose his far-seen face: a rich, fine-spun garment glows upon his body and flutters in the wind: and stallions carry him" (Homeric Hymn XXXI to Helios 6-14, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^desc-chariot]: "when he has stayed his golden-yoked chariot and horses, he rests there upon the highest point of heaven, until he marvellously drives them down again through heaven to Ocean" (Homeric Hymn XXXI to Helios 14-17)

## Birth

"Theia was subject in love to [Hyperion](hyperion.md) and bare great Helius (Sun) and clear [Selene](selene.md) (Moon) and [Eos](eos.md) (Dawn) who shines upon all that are on earth and upon the deathless Gods who live in the wide heaven."[^theog-birth]

[^theog-birth]: "Theia was subject in love to Hyperion and bare great Helius (Sun) and clear Selene (Moon) and Eos (Dawn) who shines upon all that are on earth and upon the deathless Gods who live in the wide heaven" (Theogony 371-374, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Children

"Perseis, the daughter of Ocean, bare to unwearying Helios Circe and Aeetes the king."[^theog-children]

In the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md), two further daughters are named as shepherdesses of his sacred cattle on Thrinacia: "goddesses to shepherd them, nymphs with fair tresses, Phaethusa and Lampetie whom bright Neaera bare to Helios Hyperion."[^od-nymphs]

[^theog-children]: "Perseis, the daughter of Ocean, bare to unwearying Helios Circe and Aeetes the king" (Theogony 956-957)
[^od-nymphs]: "goddesses to shepherd them, nymphs with fair tresses, Phaethusa and Lampetie whom bright Neaera bare to Helios Hyperion" (Odyssey XII.6655-6657, trans. Butcher and Lang)

## In the Hymn to Demeter

Helius, as the all-seeing sun, is one of only two witnesses to [Persephone](persephone.md)'s abduction (along with [Hecate](hecate.md)): "the lord Helios, [Hyperion](hyperion.md)'s bright son, as she cried to her father."[^hd-witness]

When [Demeter](demeter.md) and [Hecate](hecate.md) came to question him, "the Son of [Hyperion](hyperion.md) answered her: 'Queen Demeter, daughter of rich-haired [Rhea](rhea.md), I will tell you the truth; for I greatly reverence and pity you in your grief for your trim-ankled daughter. None other of the deathless gods is to blame, but only cloud-gathering [Zeus](zeus.md) who gave her to [Hades](hades.md), her father's brother, to be called his buxom wife.'"[^hd-truth]

[^hd-witness]: "the lord Helios, Hyperion's bright son, as she cried to her father, the Son of Cronos" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 26-27, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^hd-truth]: "the Son of Hyperion answered her: 'Queen Demeter, daughter of rich-haired Rhea, I will tell you the truth; for I greatly reverence and pity you in your grief for your trim-ankled daughter. None other of the deathless gods is to blame, but only cloud-gathering Zeus who gave her to Hades, her father's brother, to be called his buxom wife'" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 74-79)

## In the Odyssey

### The Cattle of Thrinacia (Book XII)

On the island of Thrinacia, Helius keeps sacred herds that are immortal and unchanging: "seven herds of kine and as many goodly flocks of sheep, and fifty in each flock. They have no part in birth or in corruption."[^od-cattle] Two of his daughters guard them: Phaethusa and Lampetie, borne to him by the nymph Neaera.[^od-nymphs]

[Circe](circe.md) warns Odysseus to leave the cattle unharmed, and Teiresias's shade gives the same counsel. But when the crew is stranded on Thrinacia by contrary winds and their provisions run out, Odysseus's men slaughter the sacred kine while he sleeps. Lampetie immediately reports the transgression: "Then swiftly to Helios Hyperion came Lampetie of the long robes, with the tidings that we had slain his kine."[^od-lampetie]

Helius's reaction is one of the most dramatic divine speeches in the poem. He threatens not merely revenge but cosmic withdrawal — to abandon the world of the living entirely: "Father [Zeus](zeus.md), and all ye other blessed gods that live for ever, take vengeance I pray you on the company of Odysseus, son of Laertes, that have insolently slain my cattle, wherein I was wont to be glad as I went toward the starry heaven, and when I again turned earthward from the firmament. And if they pay me not full atonement for the cattle, I will go down to [Hades](hades.md) and shine among the dead."[^od-threat]

[Zeus](zeus.md) responds with both reassurance and a promise of swift punishment: "Helios, do thou, I say, shine on amidst the deathless gods, and amid mortal men upon the earth, the grain-giver. But as for me, I will soon smite their swift ship with my white bolt, and cleave it in pieces in the midst of the wine-dark deep."[^od-zeus]

Odysseus notes that he was not present for this divine exchange, and that his knowledge of it came through a chain of transmission: "This I heard from Calypso of the fair hair; and she said that she herself had heard it from [Hermes](hermes.md) the Messenger."[^od-calypso]

[^od-cattle]: "seven herds of kine and as many goodly flocks of sheep, and fifty in each flock. They have no part in birth or in corruption" (Odyssey XII.6653-6655, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od-lampetie]: "Then swiftly to Helios Hyperion came Lampetie of the long robes, with the tidings that we had slain his kine" (Odyssey XII.6894-6895, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od-threat]: "Father Zeus, and all ye other blessed gods that live for ever, take vengeance I pray you on the company of Odysseus, son of Laertes, that have insolently slain my cattle, wherein I was wont to be glad as I went toward the starry heaven, and when I again turned earthward from the firmament. And if they pay me not full atonement for the cattle, I will go down to Hades and shine among the dead." (Odyssey XII.6898-6903, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od-zeus]: "Helios, do thou, I say, shine on amidst the deathless gods, and amid mortal men upon the earth, the grain-giver. But as for me, I will soon smite their swift ship with my white bolt, and cleave it in pieces in the midst of the wine-dark deep." (Odyssey XII.6905-6909, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od-calypso]: "This I heard from Calypso of the fair hair; and she said that she herself had heard it from Hermes the Messenger." (Odyssey XII.6911-6912, trans. Butcher and Lang)

## In [Pindar](../sources/pindar.md)

### The Division of the Earth and Rhodes (Olympian VII)

Pindar tells how Helius was absent when [Zeus](zeus.md) and the other gods divided the earth among themselves: "when Zeus and the other gods made division of the earth among them, not yet was island Rhodes apparent in the open sea, but in the briny depths lay hid. And for that Helios was otherwhere, none drew a lot for him; so they left him portionless of land, that holy god."[^pin-division]

When Helius protested, Zeus offered to cast lots afresh, but Helius refused: "he suffered him not, for that he said that beneath the hoary sea he saw a certain land waxing from its root in earth, that should bring forth food for many men, and rejoice in flocks."[^pin-rhodes-rising] He asked Lachesis to swear an oath that the island, once risen, would be his alone.[^pin-lachesis]

"And in the end of the matter his speech had fulfilment; there sprang up from the watery main an island, and the father who begetteth the keen rays of day hath the dominion thereof, even the lord of fire-breathing steeds."[^pin-dominion] On Rhodes, "having lain with Rhodos he begat seven sons, who had of him minds wiser than any among the men of old; and one begat Kameiros, and Ialysos his eldest, and Lindos: and they held each apart their shares of cities, making threefold division of their father's land."[^pin-sons]

### Athena's Birth (Olympian VII)

Pindar also calls Helius "the god who giveth light to men, Hyperion" and says that at [Athena](athena.md)'s birth from Zeus's head, he "bade his beloved sons see that they guard the payment of the debt" by building the first altar for the goddess.[^pin-hyperion] But they "had brands burning yet kindled not the seed of flame, but with fireless rites they made a grove on the hill of the citadel" — an honest mistake. For this, "Zeus brought a yellow cloud into the sky and rained much gold upon the land; and Glaukopis herself gave them to excel the dwellers upon earth in every art of handicraft."[^pin-golden-rain]

[^pin-division]: "when Zeus and the other gods made division of the earth among them, not yet was island Rhodes apparent in the open sea, but in the briny depths lay hid. And for that Helios was otherwhere, none drew a lot for him; so they left him portionless of land, that holy god" (Pindar, Olympian VII, trans. Ernest Myers)
[^pin-rhodes-rising]: "he suffered him not, for that he said that beneath the hoary sea he saw a certain land waxing from its root in earth, that should bring forth food for many men, and rejoice in flocks" (Pindar, Olympian VII)
[^pin-lachesis]: "he bade her of the golden fillet, Lachesis, to stretch her hands on high, nor violate the gods' great oath, but with the son of Kronos promise him that the isle sent up to the light of heaven should be thenceforth a title of himself alone" (Pindar, Olympian VII)
[^pin-dominion]: "there sprang up from the watery main an island, and the father who begetteth the keen rays of day hath the dominion thereof, even the lord of fire-breathing steeds" (Pindar, Olympian VII)
[^pin-sons]: "having lain with Rhodos he begat seven sons, who had of him minds wiser than any among the men of old; and one begat Kameiros, and Ialysos his eldest, and Lindos: and they held each apart their shares of cities, making threefold division of their father's land" (Pindar, Olympian VII)
[^pin-hyperion]: "the god who giveth light to men, Hyperion, bade his beloved sons see that they guard the payment of the debt, that they should build first for the goddess an altar in the sight of all men" (Pindar, Olympian VII)
[^pin-golden-rain]: "they though they had brands burning yet kindled not the seed of flame, but with fireless rites they made a grove on the hill of the citadel. For them Zeus brought a yellow cloud into the sky and rained much gold upon the land; and Glaukopis herself gave them to excel the dwellers upon earth in every art of handicraft" (Pindar, Olympian VII)

## In Euripides' [Medea](../sources/euripides-medea.md)

Euripides confirms Helius as [Medea](../heroes/medea.md)'s grandfather. She invokes him by oath — "Swear by the earth, and by the sun the father of my father" — and later escapes on a dragon chariot he provides: "such a chariot the sun my father's father gives me, a defense from the hostile hand."[^eur-helius-chariot] The Chorus appeals to him to intervene: "O thou earth, and thou all-illuming beam of the sun, look down upon, behold this abandoned woman... for from thy golden race they sprung."[^eur-helius-golden]

[^eur-helius-chariot]: "such a chariot the sun my father's father gives me, a defense from the hostile hand" (Medea 1321-1322, trans. T.A. Buckley)
[^eur-helius-golden]: "O thou earth, and thou all-illuming beam of the sun, look down upon, behold this abandoned woman, before she move her blood-stained hand itself about to inflict the blow against her children; for from thy golden race they sprung" (Medea 1251-1254)

## In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md)

### Mars and Venus (4.167-189)

The [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md) presents [Helius](helius.md) as the catalyst of the affair's exposure: "the Lord of Day, whose wakeful eye beholds at once whatever may transpire, witnessed the loves of Mars and Venus."[^met-helius-witness] He reported the adultery to [Hephaestus](hephaestus.md), "showing how Mars and Venus shamed his love, as they defiled his bed."[^met-helius-report] [Aphrodite](aphrodite.md) then took revenge: "The Cytherean Venus brooded on the Sun's betrayal of her stolen joys, and thought to torture him in passion's pains, and wreak requital for the pain he caused."[^met-helius-revenge]

[^met-helius-witness]: "the Lord of Day, whose wakeful eye beholds at once whatever may transpire, witnessed the loves of Mars and Venus" (Metamorphoses 4.170-173, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-helius-report]: "Grieved to know the wrong, he called the son of Juno, Vulcan, and gave full knowledge of the deed, showing how Mars and Venus shamed his love, as they defiled his bed" (Metamorphoses 4.173-176, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-helius-revenge]: "The Cytherean Venus brooded on the Sun's betrayal of her stolen joys, and thought to torture him in passion's pains, and wreak requital for the pain he caused" (Metamorphoses 4.190-193, trans. Brookes More)
