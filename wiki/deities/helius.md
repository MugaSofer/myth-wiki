## Appearance

[Homeric Hymn XXXI](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) provides the most vivid physical description of any celestial deity: "As he rides in his chariot, he shines upon men and deathless gods, and piercingly he gazes with his eyes from his golden helmet. Bright rays beam dazzlingly from him, and his bright locks streaming from the temples of his head gracefully enclose his far-seen face: a rich, fine-spun garment glows upon his body and flutters in the wind: and stallions carry him."[^desc-appearance]

He rests at heaven's peak until he "marvellously drives them down again through heaven to Ocean," riding a **golden-yoked chariot**.[^desc-chariot]

[^desc-appearance]: "As he rides in his chariot, he shines upon men and deathless gods, and piercingly he gazes with his eyes from his golden helmet. Bright rays beam dazzlingly from him, and his bright locks streaming from the temples of his head gracefully enclose his far-seen face: a rich, fine-spun garment glows upon his body and flutters in the wind: and stallions carry him" (Homeric Hymn XXXI to Helios 6-14, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^desc-chariot]: "when he has stayed his golden-yoked chariot and horses, he rests there upon the highest point of heaven, until he marvellously drives them down again through heaven to Ocean" (Homeric Hymn XXXI to Helios 14-17)

## In the Hymn to Demeter

Helius, as the all-seeing sun, is one of only two witnesses to [Persephone](persephone.md)'s abduction (along with [Hecate](hecate.md)): "the lord Helios, [Hyperion](hyperion.md)'s bright son, as she cried to her father."[^hd-witness]

When [Demeter](demeter.md) and [Hecate](hecate.md) came to question him, "the Son of [Hyperion](hyperion.md) answered her: 'Queen Demeter, daughter of rich-haired [Rhea](rhea.md), I will tell you the truth; for I greatly reverence and pity you in your grief for your trim-ankled daughter. None other of the deathless gods is to blame, but only cloud-gathering [Zeus](zeus.md) who gave her to [Hades](hades.md), her father's brother, to be called his buxom wife.'"[^hd-truth]

[^hd-witness]: "the lord Helios, Hyperion's bright son, as she cried to her father, the Son of Cronos" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 26-27, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^hd-truth]: "the Son of Hyperion answered her: 'Queen Demeter, daughter of rich-haired Rhea, I will tell you the truth; for I greatly reverence and pity you in your grief for your trim-ankled daughter. None other of the deathless gods is to blame, but only cloud-gathering Zeus who gave her to Hades, her father's brother, to be called his buxom wife'" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 74-79)
