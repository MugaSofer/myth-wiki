## Appearance

[Homeric Hymn XXXI](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) provides the most vivid physical description of any celestial deity: "As he rides in his chariot, he shines upon men and deathless gods, and piercingly he gazes with his eyes from his golden helmet. Bright rays beam dazzlingly from him, and his bright locks streaming from the temples of his head gracefully enclose his far-seen face: a rich, fine-spun garment glows upon his body and flutters in the wind: and stallions carry him."[^desc-appearance]

He rests at heaven's peak until he "marvellously drives them down again through heaven to Ocean," riding a **golden-yoked chariot**.[^desc-chariot]

[^desc-appearance]: "As he rides in his chariot, he shines upon men and deathless gods, and piercingly he gazes with his eyes from his golden helmet. Bright rays beam dazzlingly from him, and his bright locks streaming from the temples of his head gracefully enclose his far-seen face: a rich, fine-spun garment glows upon his body and flutters in the wind: and stallions carry him" (Homeric Hymn XXXI to Helios 6-14, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^desc-chariot]: "when he has stayed his golden-yoked chariot and horses, he rests there upon the highest point of heaven, until he marvellously drives them down again through heaven to Ocean" (Homeric Hymn XXXI to Helios 14-17)

## Birth

"Theia was subject in love to [Hyperion](hyperion.md) and bare great Helius (Sun) and clear [Selene](selene.md) (Moon) and [Eos](eos.md) (Dawn) who shines upon all that are on earth and upon the deathless Gods who live in the wide heaven."[^theog-birth]

[^theog-birth]: "Theia was subject in love to Hyperion and bare great Helius (Sun) and clear Selene (Moon) and Eos (Dawn) who shines upon all that are on earth and upon the deathless Gods who live in the wide heaven" (Theogony 371-374, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Children

"Perseis, the daughter of Ocean, bare to unwearying Helios Circe and Aeetes the king."[^theog-children]

In the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md), two further daughters are named as shepherdesses of his sacred cattle on Thrinacia: "goddesses to shepherd them, nymphs with fair tresses, Phaethusa and Lampetie whom bright Neaera bare to Helios Hyperion."[^od-nymphs]

[^theog-children]: "Perseis, the daughter of Ocean, bare to unwearying Helios Circe and Aeetes the king" (Theogony 956-957)
[^od-nymphs]: "goddesses to shepherd them, nymphs with fair tresses, Phaethusa and Lampetie whom bright Neaera bare to Helios Hyperion" (Odyssey XII.6655-6657, trans. Butcher and Lang)

## In the Hymn to Demeter

Helius, as the all-seeing sun, is one of only two witnesses to [Persephone](persephone.md)'s abduction (along with [Hecate](hecate.md)): "the lord Helios, [Hyperion](hyperion.md)'s bright son, as she cried to her father."[^hd-witness]

When [Demeter](demeter.md) and [Hecate](hecate.md) came to question him, "the Son of [Hyperion](hyperion.md) answered her: 'Queen Demeter, daughter of rich-haired [Rhea](rhea.md), I will tell you the truth; for I greatly reverence and pity you in your grief for your trim-ankled daughter. None other of the deathless gods is to blame, but only cloud-gathering [Zeus](zeus.md) who gave her to [Hades](hades.md), her father's brother, to be called his buxom wife.'"[^hd-truth]

[^hd-witness]: "the lord Helios, Hyperion's bright son, as she cried to her father, the Son of Cronos" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 26-27, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^hd-truth]: "the Son of Hyperion answered her: 'Queen Demeter, daughter of rich-haired Rhea, I will tell you the truth; for I greatly reverence and pity you in your grief for your trim-ankled daughter. None other of the deathless gods is to blame, but only cloud-gathering Zeus who gave her to Hades, her father's brother, to be called his buxom wife'" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 74-79)

## In the Odyssey

### The Cattle of Thrinacia (Book XII)

On the island of Thrinacia, Helius keeps sacred herds that are immortal and unchanging: "seven herds of kine and as many goodly flocks of sheep, and fifty in each flock. They have no part in birth or in corruption."[^od-cattle] Two of his daughters guard them: Phaethusa and Lampetie, borne to him by the nymph Neaera.[^od-nymphs]

[Circe](circe.md) warns Odysseus to leave the cattle unharmed, and Teiresias's shade gives the same counsel. But when the crew is stranded on Thrinacia by contrary winds and their provisions run out, Odysseus's men slaughter the sacred kine while he sleeps. Lampetie immediately reports the transgression: "Then swiftly to Helios Hyperion came Lampetie of the long robes, with the tidings that we had slain his kine."[^od-lampetie]

Helius's reaction is one of the most dramatic divine speeches in the poem. He threatens not merely revenge but cosmic withdrawal — to abandon the world of the living entirely: "Father [Zeus](zeus.md), and all ye other blessed gods that live for ever, take vengeance I pray you on the company of Odysseus, son of Laertes, that have insolently slain my cattle, wherein I was wont to be glad as I went toward the starry heaven, and when I again turned earthward from the firmament. And if they pay me not full atonement for the cattle, I will go down to [Hades](hades.md) and shine among the dead."[^od-threat]

[Zeus](zeus.md) responds with both reassurance and a promise of swift punishment: "Helios, do thou, I say, shine on amidst the deathless gods, and amid mortal men upon the earth, the grain-giver. But as for me, I will soon smite their swift ship with my white bolt, and cleave it in pieces in the midst of the wine-dark deep."[^od-zeus]

Odysseus notes that he was not present for this divine exchange, and that his knowledge of it came through a chain of transmission: "This I heard from Calypso of the fair hair; and she said that she herself had heard it from [Hermes](hermes.md) the Messenger."[^od-calypso]

And if they pay me not full atonement for the cattle, I will go down to Hades and shine among the dead." (Odyssey XII.6898-6903, trans. Butcher and Lang)
