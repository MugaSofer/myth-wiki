## Overview

**Themis** is one of the [Titans](groups/titans.md), [Zeus](zeus.md)'s second wife, and mother of the [Horae](groups/horae.md) and the [Fates](groups/fates.md).

## Birth

Listed among the children of [Gaia](gaia.md) and [Uranus](uranus.md): "she lay with Heaven and bare deep-swirling [Oceanus](oceanus.md), [Coeus](coeus.md) and [Crius](crius.md) and [Hyperion](hyperion.md) and [Iapetus](iapetus.md), [Theia](theia.md) and [Rhea](rhea.md), Themis and [Mnemosyne](mnemosyne.md) and gold-crowned [Phoebe](phoebe.md) and lovely [Tethys](tethys.md)."[^theog-birth]

[^theog-birth]: "she lay with Heaven and bare deep-swirling Oceanus, Coeus and Crius and Hyperion and Iapetus, Theia and Rhea, Themis and Mnemosyne and gold-crowned Phoebe and lovely Tethys" (Theogony 132-136, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Marriage to Zeus

Themis was [Zeus](zeus.md)'s second wife (after Metis). "Next he married bright Themis who bare the Horae (Hours), and Eunomia (Order), Dike (Justice), and blooming Eirene (Peace), who mind the works of mortal men, and the Moerae (Fates) to whom wise Zeus gave the greatest honour, Clotho, and Lachesis, and Atropos who give mortal men evil and good to have."[^theog-marriage]

[^theog-marriage]: "Next he married bright Themis who bare the Horae (Hours), and Eunomia (Order), Dike (Justice), and blooming Eirene (Peace), who mind the works of mortal men, and the Moerae (Fates) to whom wise Zeus gave the greatest honour, Clotho, and Lachesis, and Atropos who give mortal men evil and good to have" (Theogony 901-906, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## In the Odyssey

In [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) Book II, Telemachus invokes Themis at the assembly: "I pray you by Olympian [Zeus](zeus.md) and by Themis, who looseth and gathereth the meetings of men."[^od2-themis] This attributes to Themis the specific role of presiding over assemblies — she both convenes and dissolves them.

[^od2-themis]: "I pray you by Olympian Zeus and by Themis, who looseth and gathereth the meetings of men" (Odyssey 2.69-70, trans. Butcher and Lang)

## In Aeschylus' [Prometheus Bound](../sources/aeschylus-prometheus-bound.md)

The play identifies Themis as [Prometheus](prometheus.md)'s mother — a significant departure from the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md), which names his mother as the Oceanid Clymene. Prometheus refers to "the counsels of my mother Themis" and calls her "one form of many names," apparently identifying her with [Gaia](gaia.md).[^pb-themis-mother] She is called "the ancient Titaness" who gave Prometheus prophetic knowledge: "Such knowledge of the future Themis gave, the ancient Titaness, to me her son."[^pb-themis-prophecy]

Themis counselled Prometheus that craft, not force, would prevail in the war against the [Titans](groups/titans.md), leading him to side with [Zeus](zeus.md).

[^pb-themis-mother]: Prometheus refers to "the counsels of my mother Themis" who is "one form of many names" (Prometheus Bound ~211-213, trans. E.D.A. Morshead)
[^pb-themis-prophecy]: "Such knowledge of the future Themis gave, the ancient Titaness, to me her son" (Prometheus Bound ~873, trans. E.D.A. Morshead)
