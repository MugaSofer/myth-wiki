## Overview

**Mnemosyne** (Memory) is a [Titan](groups/titans.md), daughter of [Gaia](gaia.md) and [Uranus](uranus.md), and the mother of the nine [Muses](groups/muses.md) by [Zeus](zeus.md). She "reigns over the hills of Eleuther."[^theog-eleuther]

[^theog-eleuther]: "Mnemosyne (Memory), who reigns over the hills of Eleuther" (Theogony 54, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Mythology

[Zeus](zeus.md) lay with Mnemosyne for nine nights, "entering her holy bed remote from the immortals." After a year, "she bare nine daughters, all of one mind, whose hearts are set upon song and their spirit free from care" — the [Muses](groups/muses.md), born "a little way from the topmost peak of snowy [Olympus](../places/olympus.md)."[^theog-birth]

The union is described as producing "a forgetting of ills and a rest from sorrow."[^theog-sorrow]

[^theog-birth]: "For nine nights did wise Zeus lie with her, entering her holy bed remote from the immortals. And when a year was passed and the seasons came round as the months waned, and many days were accomplished, she bare nine daughters, all of one mind, whose hearts are set upon song and their spirit free from care, a little way from the topmost peak of snowy Olympus" (Theogony 56-62)
[^theog-sorrow]: "a forgetting of ills and a rest from sorrow" (Theogony 55)
