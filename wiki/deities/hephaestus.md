## Overview

**Hephaestus** is the god of craftsmanship, born of [Hera](hera.md) alone without union with [Zeus](zeus.md). He is "skilled in crafts more than all the sons of Heaven."[^theog-crafts]

[^theog-crafts]: "Hera without union with Zeus—for she was very angry and quarrelled with her mate—bare famous Hephaestus, who is skilled in crafts more than all the sons of Heaven" (Theogony 927-929, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Birth

[Hera](hera.md) bore Hephaestus without union with [Zeus](zeus.md), "for she was very angry and quarrelled with her mate."[^theog-birth]

[^theog-birth]: "Hera was very angry and quarrelled with her mate. And because of this strife she bare without union with Zeus who holds the aegis a glorious son, Hephaestus, who excelled all the sons of Heaven in crafts" (Theogony 929a-929d)

## Roles

- **Creating the first woman**: "The very famous Limping God formed of earth the likeness of a shy maiden as the son of [Cronos](cronos.md) willed." He also "made himself and worked with his own hands" a golden crown for her, decorated with "many creatures which the land and sea rear up... wonderful things, like living beings with voices."[^theog-woman]

[^theog-woman]: "the very famous Limping God formed of earth the likeness of a shy maiden as the son of Cronos willed" ... "Also she put upon her head a crown of gold which the very famous Limping God made himself and worked with his own hands as a favour to Zeus his father. On it was much curious work, wonderful to see; for of the many creatures which the land and sea rear up, he put most upon it, wonderful things, like living beings with voices: and great beauty shone out from it." (Theogony 571-584)

## Marriage

"Hephaestus, the famous Lame One, made Aglaea, youngest of the Graces, his buxom wife."[^theog-marriage]

[^theog-marriage]: "Hephaestus, the famous Lame One, made Aglaea, youngest of the Graces, his buxom wife" (Theogony 945-946)

## Variant Traditions

### Cast Out by Hera (Hymn to Apollo)

In the [Homeric Hymn to Apollo](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) (III), [Hera](hera.md) describes Hephaestus as "weakly among all the blessed gods and shrivelled of foot, a shame and disgrace to me in heaven, whom I myself took in my hands and cast out so that he fell in the great sea. But silver-shod Thetis the daughter of [Nereus](nereus.md) took and cared for him with her sisters."[^hh3-cast]

This adds detail not found in the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md) — the casting out, his rescue by Thetis, and the description of him as "shrivelled of foot."

[^hh3-cast]: "my son Hephaestus whom I bare was weakly among all the blessed gods and shrivelled of foot, a shame and disgrace to me in heaven, whom I myself took in my hands and cast out so that he fell in the great sea. But silver-shod Thetis the daughter of Nereus took and cared for him with her sisters" (Homeric Hymn III to Apollo 316-321, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## In the Iliad

### Peacemaker on Olympus (Book I)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book I, when [Zeus](zeus.md) and [Hera](hera.md) quarrel, Hephaestus rises to make peace, urging his mother: "So I give counsel to my mother, though herself is wise, to do kindness to our dear father Zeus, that our father upbraid us not again and cast the banquet in confusion. What if the Olympian, the lord of the lightning, will to dash us from our seats! for he is strongest far."[^il1-peace]

He then serves wine to all the gods: "laughter unquenchable arose amid the blessed gods to see Hephaistos bustling through the palace."[^il1-laughter]

### Variant Tradition: Hurled by Zeus

In this same speech, Hephaestus tells a **variant tradition** of his fall — here it is [Zeus](zeus.md), not [Hera](hera.md), who cast him out: "Yea, once ere this, when I was fain to save thee, he caught me by my foot and hurled me from the heavenly threshold; all day I flew, and at the set of sun I fell in Lemnos, and little life was in me. There did the Sintian folk forthwith tend me for my fall."[^il1-fall]

This contradicts the [Homeric Hymn to Apollo](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) (III), where Hera herself cast him out and Thetis rescued him from the sea. In the Iliad version, Zeus hurls him, he lands on Lemnos (not in the sea), and the Sintian people tend him.

[^il1-peace]: "So I give counsel to my mother, though herself is wise, to do kindness to our dear father Zeus, that our father upbraid us not again and cast the banquet in confusion. What if the Olympian, the lord of the lightning, will to dash us from our seats! for he is strongest far" (Iliad I.738-748, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il1-laughter]: "laughter unquenchable arose amid the blessed gods to see Hephaistos bustling through the palace" (Iliad I.763-764)
[^il1-fall]: "once ere this, when I was fain to save thee, he caught me by my foot and hurled me from the heavenly threshold; all day I flew, and at the set of sun I fell in Lemnos, and little life was in me. There did the Sintian folk forthwith tend me for my fall" (Iliad I.755-758)

### His Workshop and the Shield of Achilles (Book XVIII)

[Thetis](thetis.md) comes to Hephaistos's house — "imperishable, starlike, far seen among the dwellings of Immortals, a house of bronze, wrought by the crook-footed god himself." She finds him forging self-moving golden tripods: "beneath the base of each he had set golden wheels, that of their own motion they might enter the assembly of the gods and again return unto his house, a marvel to look upon."[^il18-house]

He is aided by golden handmaidens: "there were handmaidens of gold that moved to help their lord, the semblances of living maids. In them is understanding at their hearts, in them are voice and strength, and they have skill of the immortal gods."[^il18-maidens]

He forges the Shield of Achilles — a complete cosmos in miniature: earth, heavens, sea, sun, moon, constellations ("Pleiads and Hyads and Orion's might, and the Bear... that alone hath no part in the baths of Ocean"); two cities (one at peace with a marriage feast and trial, one at war with [Ares](ares.md) and [Athena](athena.md) wrought in gold leading the troops, and Strife, Tumult, and Death personified); ploughing, reaping, vintage, cattle, sheep; a dancing-place "like unto that which once in wide Knosos Daidalos wrought for Ariadne of the lovely tresses"; and "the great might of the River of Ocean around the uttermost rim."[^il18-shield]

[^il18-house]: "she came unto the house of Hephaistos, imperishable, starlike, far seen among the dwellings of Immortals, a house of bronze, wrought by the crook-footed god himself. Him found she sweating in toil and busy about his bellows, for he was forging tripods twenty in all... beneath the base of each he had set golden wheels, that of their own motion they might enter the assembly of the gods and again return unto his house, a marvel to look upon" (Iliad XVIII.10712-10718, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il18-maidens]: "there were handmaidens of gold that moved to help their lord, the semblances of living maids. In them is understanding at their hearts, in them are voice and strength, and they have skill of the immortal gods" (Iliad XVIII.10723-10726)
[^il18-shield]: "There wrought he the earth, and the heavens, and the sea, and the unwearying sun, and the moon waxing to the full, and the signs every one wherewith the heavens are crowned, Pleiads and Hyads and Orion's might, and the Bear that men call also the Wain, her that turneth in her place and watcheth Orion, and alone hath no part in the baths of Ocean" (Iliad XVIII.10783-10788)
