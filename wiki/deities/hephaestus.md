## Overview

**Hephaestus** is the god of craftsmanship, born of [Hera](hera.md) alone without union with [Zeus](zeus.md). He is "skilled in crafts more than all the sons of Heaven."[^theog-crafts]

[^theog-crafts]: "Hera without union with Zeus—for she was very angry and quarrelled with her mate—bare famous Hephaestus, who is skilled in crafts more than all the sons of Heaven" (Theogony 927-929, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Birth

[Hera](hera.md) bore Hephaestus without union with [Zeus](zeus.md), "for she was very angry and quarrelled with her mate."[^theog-birth]

[^theog-birth]: "Hera was very angry and quarrelled with her mate. And because of this strife she bare without union with Zeus who holds the aegis a glorious son, Hephaestus, who excelled all the sons of Heaven in crafts" (Theogony 929a-929d)

## Roles

- **Creating the first woman**: "The very famous Limping God formed of earth the likeness of a shy maiden as the son of [Cronos](cronos.md) willed." He also "made himself and worked with his own hands" a golden crown for her, decorated with "many creatures which the land and sea rear up... wonderful things, like living beings with voices."[^theog-woman]

[^theog-woman]: "the very famous Limping God formed of earth the likeness of a shy maiden as the son of Cronos willed" ... "Also she put upon her head a crown of gold which the very famous Limping God made himself and worked with his own hands as a favour to Zeus his father. On it was much curious work, wonderful to see; for of the many creatures which the land and sea rear up, he put most upon it, wonderful things, like living beings with voices: and great beauty shone out from it." (Theogony 571-584)

"Hephaestus, the famous Lame One, made Aglaea, youngest of the Graces, his buxom wife."[^theog-marriage]

## Variant Traditions

### Cast Out by Hera (Hymn to Apollo)

In the [Homeric Hymn to Apollo](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) (III), [Hera](hera.md) describes Hephaestus as "weakly among all the blessed gods and shrivelled of foot, a shame and disgrace to me in heaven, whom I myself took in my hands and cast out so that he fell in the great sea. But silver-shod Thetis the daughter of [Nereus](nereus.md) took and cared for him with her sisters."[^hh3-cast]

This adds detail not found in the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md) — the casting out, his rescue by Thetis, and the description of him as "shrivelled of foot."

[^hh3-cast]: "my son Hephaestus whom I bare was weakly among all the blessed gods and shrivelled of foot, a shame and disgrace to me in heaven, whom I myself took in my hands and cast out so that he fell in the great sea. But silver-shod Thetis the daughter of Nereus took and cared for him with her sisters" (Homeric Hymn III to Apollo 316-321, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
