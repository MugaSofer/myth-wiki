## Overview

**Hephaestus** is the god of craftsmanship, born of [Hera](hera.md) alone without union with [Zeus](zeus.md). He is "skilled in crafts more than all the sons of Heaven."[^theog-crafts]

[^theog-crafts]: "Hera without union with Zeus—for she was very angry and quarrelled with her mate—bare famous Hephaestus, who is skilled in crafts more than all the sons of Heaven" (Theogony 927-929, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Epithets

- **"the famous Limping God"** / **"the famous Lame One"** — (Theogony 571, 945)
- **"skilled in crafts more than all the sons of Heaven"** — (Theogony 929)
- **"the crook-footed god"** — the most frequent Iliad epithet (Iliad XVIII passim)

## Appearance

In the [Homeric Hymn to Apollo](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) (III), [Hera](hera.md) describes him as "weakly among all the blessed gods and shrivelled of foot, a shame and disgrace to me in heaven."[^desc-shrivelled] In the Iliad, he is "the crook-footed god" who bustles through the palace serving wine, provoking "laughter unquenchable... amid the blessed gods."[^desc-laughter]

His workshop house is "imperishable, starlike, far seen among the dwellings of Immortals, a house of bronze, wrought by the crook-footed god himself." When [Thetis](thetis.md) finds him, he is "sweating in toil and busy about his bellows."[^desc-house]

[^desc-shrivelled]: "my son Hephaestus whom I bare was weakly among all the blessed gods and shrivelled of foot, a shame and disgrace to me in heaven" (Homeric Hymn III to Apollo 316-318, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^desc-laughter]: "laughter unquenchable arose amid the blessed gods to see Hephaistos bustling through the palace" (Iliad I.763-764, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^desc-house]: "she came unto the house of Hephaistos, imperishable, starlike, far seen among the dwellings of Immortals, a house of bronze, wrought by the crook-footed god himself. Him found she sweating in toil and busy about his bellows" (Iliad XVIII.10712-10715)

## Powers

- **Supreme craftsmanship:** "Skilled in crafts more than all the sons of Heaven." His creations include: the first woman's golden crown ("wonderful things, like living beings with voices"), self-moving golden tripods, [Agamemnon's sceptre](../sources/iliad.md), and the [Shield of Achilles](../objects/shield-of-achilles.md) (an entire cosmos in miniature).[^desc-crafts]
- **Automata:** His golden handmaidens are "the semblances of living maids. In them is understanding at their hearts, in them are voice and strength, and they have skill of the immortal gods." His tripods move "of their own motion" to enter the assembly of the gods.[^desc-automata]
- **Fire:** He burns the River [Xanthos](../sources/iliad.md) at [Hera](hera.md)'s command — consuming elms, willows, tamarisks, and lotus until the river submits and swears an oath.[^desc-fire]

[^desc-crafts]: "the very famous Limping God formed of earth the likeness of a shy maiden... wonderful things, like living beings with voices: and great beauty shone out from it" (Theogony 571-584)
[^desc-automata]: "there were handmaidens of gold that moved to help their lord, the semblances of living maids. In them is understanding at their hearts, in them are voice and strength, and they have skill of the immortal gods" (Iliad XVIII.10723-10726)
[^desc-fire]: (Iliad XXI)

## Birth

[Hera](hera.md) bore Hephaestus without union with [Zeus](zeus.md), "for she was very angry and quarrelled with her mate."[^theog-birth]

[^theog-birth]: "Hera was very angry and quarrelled with her mate. And because of this strife she bare without union with Zeus who holds the aegis a glorious son, Hephaestus, who excelled all the sons of Heaven in crafts" (Theogony 929a-929d)

## Roles

- **Creating the first woman**: "The very famous Limping God formed of earth the likeness of a shy maiden as the son of [Cronos](cronos.md) willed." He also "made himself and worked with his own hands" a golden crown for her, decorated with "many creatures which the land and sea rear up... wonderful things, like living beings with voices."[^theog-woman]

[^theog-woman]: "the very famous Limping God formed of earth the likeness of a shy maiden as the son of Cronos willed" ... "Also she put upon her head a crown of gold which the very famous Limping God made himself and worked with his own hands as a favour to Zeus his father. On it was much curious work, wonderful to see; for of the many creatures which the land and sea rear up, he put most upon it, wonderful things, like living beings with voices: and great beauty shone out from it." (Theogony 571-584)

## Marriage

"Hephaestus, the famous Lame One, made Aglaea, youngest of the Graces, his buxom wife."[^theog-marriage]

[^theog-marriage]: "Hephaestus, the famous Lame One, made Aglaea, youngest of the Graces, his buxom wife" (Theogony 945-946)

## Variant Traditions

### Cast Out by Hera (Hymn to Apollo)

In the [Homeric Hymn to Apollo](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) (III), [Hera](hera.md) describes Hephaestus as "weakly among all the blessed gods and shrivelled of foot, a shame and disgrace to me in heaven, whom I myself took in my hands and cast out so that he fell in the great sea. But silver-shod Thetis the daughter of [Nereus](nereus.md) took and cared for him with her sisters."[^hh3-cast]

This adds detail not found in the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md) — the casting out, his rescue by Thetis, and the description of him as "shrivelled of foot."

[^hh3-cast]: "my son Hephaestus whom I bare was weakly among all the blessed gods and shrivelled of foot, a shame and disgrace to me in heaven, whom I myself took in my hands and cast out so that he fell in the great sea. But silver-shod Thetis the daughter of Nereus took and cared for him with her sisters" (Homeric Hymn III to Apollo 316-321, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## In the Iliad

### Peacemaker on Olympus (Book I)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book I, when [Zeus](zeus.md) and [Hera](hera.md) quarrel, Hephaestus rises to make peace, urging his mother: "So I give counsel to my mother, though herself is wise, to do kindness to our dear father Zeus, that our father upbraid us not again and cast the banquet in confusion. What if the Olympian, the lord of the lightning, will to dash us from our seats! for he is strongest far."[^il1-peace]

He then serves wine to all the gods: "laughter unquenchable arose amid the blessed gods to see Hephaistos bustling through the palace."[^il1-laughter]

### Variant Tradition: Hurled by Zeus

In this same speech, Hephaestus tells a **variant tradition** of his fall — here it is [Zeus](zeus.md), not [Hera](hera.md), who cast him out: "Yea, once ere this, when I was fain to save thee, he caught me by my foot and hurled me from the heavenly threshold; all day I flew, and at the set of sun I fell in Lemnos, and little life was in me. There did the Sintian folk forthwith tend me for my fall."[^il1-fall]

This contradicts the [Homeric Hymn to Apollo](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) (III), where Hera herself cast him out and Thetis rescued him from the sea. In the Iliad version, Zeus hurls him, he lands on Lemnos (not in the sea), and the Sintian people tend him.

[^il1-peace]: "So I give counsel to my mother, though herself is wise, to do kindness to our dear father Zeus, that our father upbraid us not again and cast the banquet in confusion. What if the Olympian, the lord of the lightning, will to dash us from our seats! for he is strongest far" (Iliad I.738-748, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il1-laughter]: "laughter unquenchable arose amid the blessed gods to see Hephaistos bustling through the palace" (Iliad I.763-764)
[^il1-fall]: "once ere this, when I was fain to save thee, he caught me by my foot and hurled me from the heavenly threshold; all day I flew, and at the set of sun I fell in Lemnos, and little life was in me. There did the Sintian folk forthwith tend me for my fall" (Iliad I.755-758)

### His Workshop and the Shield of Achilles (Book XVIII)

[Thetis](thetis.md) comes to Hephaistos's house — "imperishable, starlike, far seen among the dwellings of Immortals, a house of bronze, wrought by the crook-footed god himself." She finds him forging self-moving golden tripods: "beneath the base of each he had set golden wheels, that of their own motion they might enter the assembly of the gods and again return unto his house, a marvel to look upon."[^il18-house]

He is aided by golden handmaidens: "there were handmaidens of gold that moved to help their lord, the semblances of living maids. In them is understanding at their hearts, in them are voice and strength, and they have skill of the immortal gods."[^il18-maidens]

He forges the [Shield of Achilles](../objects/shield-of-achilles.md) — a complete cosmos in miniature: earth, heavens, sea, sun, moon, constellations ("Pleiads and Hyads and Orion's might, and the Bear... that alone hath no part in the baths of Ocean"); two cities (one at peace with a marriage feast and trial, one at war with [Ares](ares.md) and [Athena](athena.md) wrought in gold leading the troops, and Strife, Tumult, and Death personified); ploughing, reaping, vintage, cattle, sheep; a dancing-place "like unto that which once in wide Knosos Daidalos wrought for Ariadne of the lovely tresses"; and "the great might of the River of Ocean around the uttermost rim."[^il18-shield]

[^il18-house]: "she came unto the house of Hephaistos, imperishable, starlike, far seen among the dwellings of Immortals, a house of bronze, wrought by the crook-footed god himself. Him found she sweating in toil and busy about his bellows, for he was forging tripods twenty in all... beneath the base of each he had set golden wheels, that of their own motion they might enter the assembly of the gods and again return unto his house, a marvel to look upon" (Iliad XVIII.10712-10718, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il18-maidens]: "there were handmaidens of gold that moved to help their lord, the semblances of living maids. In them is understanding at their hearts, in them are voice and strength, and they have skill of the immortal gods" (Iliad XVIII.10723-10726)
[^il18-shield]: "There wrought he the earth, and the heavens, and the sea, and the unwearying sun, and the moon waxing to the full, and the signs every one wherewith the heavens are crowned, Pleiads and Hyads and Orion's might, and the Bear that men call also the Wain, her that turneth in her place and watcheth Orion, and alone hath no part in the baths of Ocean" (Iliad XVIII.10783-10788)

## In the Odyssey

### Hephaestus's Craft at Alcinous's Palace (Book VII)

In Book VII, Alcinous's palace is guarded by Hephaestus's creations: "on either side stood golden hounds and silver, which Hephaestus wrought by his cunning, to guard the palace of great-hearted Alcinous, being free from death and age all their days."[^od7-hounds]

[^od7-hounds]: "on either side stood golden hounds and silver, which Hephaestus wrought by his cunning, to guard the palace of great-hearted Alcinous, being free from death and age all their days" (Odyssey VII.3893-3895, trans. Butcher and Lang)

### The Song of Ares and Aphrodite (Book VIII)

In [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) Book VIII, the minstrel Demodocus sings of Hephaestus's revenge on [Ares](ares.md) and [Aphrodite](aphrodite.md). When [Helius](helius.md) reported their adultery, "he went his way to the forge, devising evil in the deep of his heart, and set the great anvil on the stithy, and wrought fetters that none might snap or loosen, that the lovers might there unmoveably remain."[^od8-forge] The net was "subtle as spiders' webs, so that none might see them, even of the blessed gods: so cunningly were they forged."[^od8-web]

He then "made as though he would go to Lemnos, that stablished castle, and this was far the dearest of all lands in his sight." When the trap was sprung, he summoned the gods: "Father [Zeus](zeus.md), and ye other blessed gods, that live for ever, come hither, that ye may see a mirthful thing and a cruel." He lamented: "Aphrodite, daughter of Zeus, ever dishonours me by reason of my lameness, and sets her heart on Ares the destroyer, because he is fair and straight of limb, but as for me, feeble was I born."[^od8-lament]

"Laughter unquenchable arose among the blessed gods, as they beheld the sleight of cunning Hephaestus." [Poseidon](poseidon.md) guaranteed Ares's fine: "even if Ares avoid the debt and flee away, I myself will pay thee all." Hephaestus released them, and was called "the famous god of the strong arms."[^od8-release]

[^od8-forge]: "he went his way to the forge, devising evil in the deep of his heart, and set the great anvil on the stithy, and wrought fetters that none might snap or loosen, that the lovers might there unmoveably remain" (Odyssey VIII.4412-4414, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od8-web]: "subtle as spiders' webs, so that none might see them, even of the blessed gods: so cunningly were they forged" (Odyssey VIII.4419-4420)
[^od8-lament]: "Aphrodite, daughter of Zeus, ever dishonours me by reason of my lameness, and sets her heart on Ares the destroyer, because he is fair and straight of limb, but as for me, feeble was I born. Howbeit, there is none to blame but my father and mother,—would they had never begotten me!" (Odyssey VIII.4446-4450)
[^od8-release]: "laughter unquenchable arose among the blessed gods, as they beheld the sleight of cunning Hephaestus... Poseidon answered him, shaker of the earth: 'Hephaestus, even if Ares avoid the debt and flee away, I myself will pay thee all.' Then the famous god of the strong arms answered him: 'It may not be that I should say thee nay'" (Odyssey VIII.4463-4501)

## In the Bibliotheca

Apollodorus presents the birth traditions side by side: "[Hera](hera.md) gave birth to Hephaestus without intercourse with the other sex, but according to Homer he was one of her children by [Zeus](zeus.md)."[^apd-heph-birth]

He gives a specific reason for Hephaestus being cast from heaven: [Zeus](zeus.md) cast him out "because he came to the rescue of [Hera](hera.md) in her bonds. For when [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) had taken Troy and was at sea, Hera sent a storm after him; so Zeus hung her from Olympus."[^apd-heph-cast] Hephaestus "fell on Lemnos and was lamed of his legs, but [Thetis](thetis.md) saved him."[^apd-heph-lemnos]

This combines elements from multiple earlier traditions: the Iliad's account of Zeus hurling Hephaestus (I.755-758, where the fall is to Lemnos and the Sintian people tend him) and the Hymn to Apollo's account of Thetis rescuing him (III.316-321, where Hera casts him into the sea). Apollodorus merges them: Zeus does the casting, the fall is to Lemnos (as in the Iliad), but Thetis saves him (as in the Hymn).

[^apd-heph-birth]: "Hera gave birth to Hephaestus without intercourse with the other sex, but according to Homer he was one of her children by Zeus" (Bibliotheca 1.3.5, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-heph-cast]: "Him Zeus cast out of heaven, because he came to the rescue of Hera in her bonds. For when Hercules had taken Troy and was at sea, Hera sent a storm after him; so Zeus hung her from Olympus" (Bibliotheca 1.3.5, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-heph-lemnos]: "Hephaestus fell on Lemnos and was lamed of his legs, but Thetis saved him" (Bibliotheca 1.3.5, trans. Frazer)

## In the Bibliotheca (1.4.3-1.4.4, 1.6.2)

### Orion's Visit to the Smithy (1.4.3)

When Orion was blinded by Oenopion and cast on the beach, "he went to the smithy of Hephaestus, and snatching up a lad set him on his shoulders and bade him lead him to the sunrise."[^apd-heph-smithy]

### The Underground House (1.4.4)

[Poseidon](poseidon.md) protected Oenopion from Orion's vengeance by hiding him in "a house under the earth constructed by Hephaestus."[^apd-heph-house]

### Slaying Mimas in the Gigantomachy (1.6.2)

During the battle with the [Giants](../creatures/giants.md), "Mimas [was killed] by Hephaestus with missiles of red-hot metal."[^apd-heph-mimas]

[^apd-heph-smithy]: "he went to the smithy of Hephaestus, and snatching up a lad set him on his shoulders and bade him lead him to the sunrise" (Bibliotheca 1.4.3, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-heph-house]: "for him Poseidon had made ready a house under the earth constructed by Hephaestus" (Bibliotheca 1.4.4, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-heph-mimas]: "Mimas by Hephaestus with missiles of red-hot metal" (Bibliotheca 1.6.2, trans. Frazer)

## In the Bibliotheca (2.4.11, 2.5.6)

### Gifts to Heracles

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) lists Hephaestus among the gods who armed [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) before his labours: Heracles "received a sword from [Hermes](hermes.md), a bow and arrows from [Apollo](apollo.md), a golden breastplate from Hephaestus, and a robe from [Athena](athena.md)."[^apd-heph-breastplate]

### Brazen Castanets for Athena

For the sixth labour (the Stymphalian birds), "[Athena](athena.md) gave him brazen castanets, which she had received from Hephaestus."[^apd-heph-castanets] By clashing them on a mountain that overhung the lake, Heracles scared the birds into flight and shot them.

[^apd-heph-breastplate]: "Hercules received a sword from Hermes, a bow and arrows from Apollo, a golden breastplate from Hephaestus, and a robe from Athena" (Bibliotheca 2.4.11, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-heph-castanets]: "Athena gave him brazen castanets, which she had received from Hephaestus" (Bibliotheca 2.5.6, trans. J.G. Frazer)
