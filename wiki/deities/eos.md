## Overview

**Eos** (Dawn) is a daughter of the [Titans](titans.md) [Hyperion](hyperion.md) and [Theia](theia.md), who "shines upon all that are on earth and upon the deathless Gods who live in the wide heaven."[^theog-birth]

## Children

With Astraeus (son of [Crius](crius.md) and Eurybia), Eos bore "the strong-hearted winds, brightening Zephyrus, and Boreas, headlong in his course, and Notus,—a goddess mating in love with a god."[^theog-winds] She also bore "the star Eosphorus (Dawn-bringer), and the gleaming stars with which heaven is crowned."[^theog-stars]

[^theog-stars]: "Erigenia bare the star Eosphorus (Dawn-bringer), and the gleaming stars with which heaven is crowned" (Theogony 381-382)

## Eos and Tithonus (Hymn to Aphrodite)

In the [Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) (V), [Aphrodite](aphrodite.md) tells the story of Eos and Tithonus as a cautionary tale. "Golden-throned Eos rapt away Tithonus who was of your race and like the deathless gods. And she went to ask the dark-clouded Son of [Cronos](cronos.md) that he should be deathless and live eternally; and [Zeus](zeus.md) bowed his head to her prayer and fulfilled her desire."[^hh5-tithonus]

"Too simply was queenly Eos: she thought not in her heart to ask youth for him and to strip him of the slough of deadly age." When old age came upon him, "she laid him in a room and put to the shining doors. There he babbles endlessly, and no more has strength at all, such as once he had in his supple limbs."[^hh5-age]

[^hh5-tithonus]: "golden-throned Eos rapt away Tithonus who was of your race and like the deathless gods. And she went to ask the dark-clouded Son of Cronos that he should be deathless and live eternally; and Zeus bowed his head to her prayer and fulfilled her desire" (Homeric Hymn V to Aphrodite 218-221, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^hh5-age]: "Too simply was queenly Eos: she thought not in her heart to ask youth for him and to strip him of the slough of deadly age... she laid him in a room and put to the shining doors. There he babbles endlessly, and no more has strength at all" (Homeric Hymn V to Aphrodite 223-238)

## In the Odyssey

### Dawn and Orion (Book V)

In [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) Book V, Calypso cites Eos's love for Orion as a precedent for the gods' jealousy toward goddesses who take mortal lovers: "Even so when rosy-fingered Dawn took Orion for her lover, ye gods that live at ease were jealous thereof, till chaste [Artemis](artemis.md), of the golden throne, slew him in Ortygia with the visitation of her gentle shafts."[^od5-orion]

[^od5-orion]: "Even so when rosy-fingered Dawn took Orion for her lover, ye gods that live at ease were jealous thereof, till chaste Artemis, of the golden throne, slew him in Ortygia with the visitation of her gentle shafts" (Odyssey V.3095-3098, trans. Butcher and Lang)

## Eos and Cleitus (Odyssey XV)

In [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) Book XV, another instance of Dawn's pattern of snatching beautiful mortals: "the golden-throned Dawn snatched away Cleitus for his very beauty's sake, that he might dwell with the Immortals."[^od15-cleitus] Like Tithonus and Orion before him, Cleitus was taken by Eos for his beauty — reinforcing the recurring motif of Dawn's desire for mortal men.

[^od15-cleitus]: "the golden-throned Dawn snatched away Cleitus for his very beauty's sake, that he might dwell with the Immortals" (Odyssey XV.8212-8213, trans. Butcher and Lang)

## In the Bibliotheca (1.4.4)

### Aphrodite's Curse and Orion

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) provides an explanation for Eos's pattern of falling in love with mortal men: "[Eos] fell in love with Orion and carried him off and brought him to Delos; for [Aphrodite](aphrodite.md) caused [Eos] to be perpetually in love, because she had bedded with [Ares](ares.md)."[^apd-eos-curse]

> **NEW DETAIL:** This is the only source in our corpus that explains *why* Eos keeps falling in love with mortals. The [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) V and [Homeric Hymn V](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) mention her abductions of Orion and Tithonus but give no reason. The Bibliotheca traces it to Aphrodite's jealousy over Eos's affair with Ares.

[^apd-eos-curse]: "Dawn fell in love with Orion and carried him off and brought him to Delos; for Aphrodite caused Dawn to be perpetually in love, because she had bedded with Ares" (Bibliotheca 1.4.4, trans. Frazer)

## In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md)

### The Mourning of Memnon (13.576-622)

Although Aurora had supported [Troy](../places/troy.md), "she had no heart nor leisure to be moved by fall of Troy or fate of [Hecuba](../heroes/hecuba.md). At home she bore a greater grief and care; her loss of Memnon is afflicting her."[^met-eos-grief] She had seen her son killed by [Achilles](../heroes/achilles.md): "Aurora, his rose-tinted mother, saw him perish by Achilles' deadly spear, upon the Phrygian plain. She saw his death, and the loved rose that lights the dawning hour turned death-pale, and the sky was veiled in clouds."[^met-eos-pale]

Aurora threw herself at [Zeus](zeus.md)'s feet to beg for some honour for her fallen son. She described herself as the least honoured of the gods: "Beneath all those whom golden heaven sustains; (inferior, for see, through all the world my temples are so few) I have come now a goddess, to you."[^met-eos-plea] She asked not for temples or festivals but only "some honor, some comfort for his death, a little ease his mother's grief."[^met-eos-request]

Zeus nodded assent, and Memnon's funeral pyre collapsed as "volumes of black smoke obscured the day." From the ashes, birds were formed: "Black ashes fly and, rolling up a shape, retain a form and gather heat and life out of the fire. Their lightness gave them wings, first like a bird and then in fact a bird."[^met-eos-birds] These birds, called the Memnonides, divided into two groups and fought each other as a sacrifice, falling back into the ashes. "Always when the Sun has passed the twelve signs of the Zodiac, they war again, to perish as a sacrifice for him."[^met-eos-annual]

Aurora's grief was permanent: "even now, she sheds affectionate tears: and sprinkles them as dew on all the world."[^met-eos-dew]

[^met-eos-grief]: "Although Aurora had given aid to Troy, she had no heart nor leisure to be moved by fall of Troy or fate of Hecuba. At home she bore a greater grief and care; her loss of Memnon is afflicting her" (Metamorphoses 13.576-580, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-eos-pale]: "Aurora, his rose-tinted mother, saw him perish by Achilles' deadly spear, upon the Phrygian plain. She saw his death, and the loved rose that lights the dawning hour turned death-pale, and the sky was veiled in clouds" (Metamorphoses 13.581-585, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-eos-plea]: "Beneath all those whom golden heaven sustains; (inferior, for see, through all the world my temples are so few) I have come now a goddess, to you" (Metamorphoses 13.590-593)
[^met-eos-request]: "Give my son, I pray, O highest ruler of the gods, some honor, some comfort for his death, a little ease his mother's grief" (Metamorphoses 13.606-609)
[^met-eos-birds]: "Black ashes fly and, rolling up a shape, retain a form and gather heat and life out of the fire. Their lightness gave them wings, first like a bird and then in fact a bird" (Metamorphoses 13.604-608)
[^met-eos-annual]: "always when the Sun has passed the twelve signs of the Zodiac, they war again, to perish as a sacrifice for him" (Metamorphoses 13.618-620)
[^met-eos-dew]: "even now, she sheds affectionate tears: and sprinkles them as dew on all the world" (Metamorphoses 13.621-622)
