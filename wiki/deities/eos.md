## Eos and Tithonus (Hymn to Aphrodite)

In the [Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) (V), [Aphrodite](aphrodite.md) tells the story of Eos and Tithonus as a cautionary tale. "Golden-throned Eos rapt away Tithonus who was of your race and like the deathless gods. And she went to ask the dark-clouded Son of [Cronos](cronos.md) that he should be deathless and live eternally; and [Zeus](zeus.md) bowed his head to her prayer and fulfilled her desire."[^hh5-tithonus]

"Too simply was queenly Eos: she thought not in her heart to ask youth for him and to strip him of the slough of deadly age." When old age came upon him, "she laid him in a room and put to the shining doors. There he babbles endlessly, and no more has strength at all, such as once he had in his supple limbs."[^hh5-age]
