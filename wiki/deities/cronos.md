**Cronos** was the youngest of the [Titans](titans.md), children of [Gaia](gaia.md) and [Uranus](uranus.md). He is described as the "youngest and most terrible of her children" who "hated his lusty sire."[^theog-youngest]

[^theog-youngest]: "After them was born Cronos the wily, youngest and most terrible of her children, and he hated his lusty sire" (Theogony 137-138, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Mythology

### The Castration of Uranus

When [Gaia](gaia.md) called on her children to punish [Uranus](uranus.md) for imprisoning them, "fear seized them all, and none of them uttered a word."[^theog-fear] Only Cronos "took courage and answered his dear mother," volunteering: "Mother, I will undertake to do this deed, for I reverence not our father of evil name, for he first thought of doing shameful things."[^theog-volunteer]

Gaia "set and hid him in an ambush, and put in his hands a jagged sickle, and revealed to him the whole plot."[^theog-ambush] When [Uranus](uranus.md) came to lie with Gaia, "the son from his ambush stretched forth his left hand and in his right took the great long sickle with jagged teeth, and swiftly lopped off his own father's members and cast them away to fall behind him."[^theog-castration]

From the blood that fell on Gaia, she bore the [Erinyes](../creatures/erinyes.md), the [Giants](../creatures/giants.md), and the Meliae nymphs.[^theog-blood] From the severed members cast into the sea, [Aphrodite](aphrodite.md) was born.[^theog-aphrodite]

After this, Uranus named his sons "Titans (Strainers) in reproach, for he said that they strained and did presumptuously a fearful deed, and that vengeance for it would come afterwards."[^theog-name]

[^theog-fear]: "fear seized them all, and none of them uttered a word" (Theogony 167)
[^theog-volunteer]: "great Cronos the wily took courage and answered his dear mother: 'Mother, I will undertake to do this deed, for I reverence not our father of evil name, for he first thought of doing shameful things.'" (Theogony 168-172)
[^theog-ambush]: "vast Earth rejoiced greatly in spirit, and set and hid him in an ambush, and put in his hands a jagged sickle, and revealed to him the whole plot" (Theogony 173-175)
[^theog-castration]: "the son from his ambush stretched forth his left hand and in his right took the great long sickle with jagged teeth, and swiftly lopped off his own father's members and cast them away to fall behind him" (Theogony 178-181)
[^theog-blood]: "all the bloody drops that gushed forth Earth received, and as the seasons moved round she bare the strong Erinyes and the great Giants with gleaming armour, holding long spears in their hands and the Nymphs whom they call Meliae all over the boundless earth" (Theogony 183-187)
[^theog-aphrodite]: "so soon as he had cut off the members with flint and cast them from the land into the surging sea, they were swept away over the main a long time: and a white foam spread around them from the immortal flesh, and in it there grew a maiden" (Theogony 188-192)
[^theog-name]: "these sons whom he begot himself great Heaven used to call Titans (Strainers) in reproach, for he said that they strained and did presumptuously a fearful deed, and that vengeance for it would come afterwards" (Theogony 207-210)

### Swallowing His Children

[Rhea](rhea.md) bore Cronos "splendid children" — [Hestia](hestia.md), [Demeter](demeter.md), [Hera](hera.md), [Hades](hades.md), [Poseidon](poseidon.md), and [Zeus](zeus.md). But Cronos "swallowed [them] as each came forth from the womb to his mother's knees," because "he learned from [Earth](gaia.md) and starry [Heaven](uranus.md) that he was destined to be overcome by his own son, strong though he was, through the contriving of great Zeus. Therefore he kept no blind outlook, but watched and swallowed down his children."[^theog-swallow]

He was deceived when [Rhea](rhea.md), counselled by [Gaia](gaia.md) and [Uranus](uranus.md), hid the newborn [Zeus](zeus.md) in Crete and gave Cronos "a great stone wrapped in swaddling clothes. Then he took it in his hands and thrust it down into his belly: wretch! he knew not in his heart that in place of the stone his son was left behind, unconquered and untroubled, and that he was soon to overcome him by force and might and drive him from his honours."[^theog-stone]

[^theog-swallow]: "great Cronos swallowed as each came forth from the womb to his mother's knees... For he learned from Earth and starry Heaven that he was destined to be overcome by his own son, strong though he was, through the contriving of great Zeus. Therefore he kept no blind outlook, but watched and swallowed down his children" (Theogony 459-465)
[^theog-stone]: "she gave a great stone wrapped in swaddling clothes. Then he took it in his hands and thrust it down into his belly: wretch! he knew not in his heart that in place of the stone his son was left behind, unconquered and untroubled, and that he was soon to overcome him by force and might and drive him from his honours" (Theogony 481-485)

## In Works and Days

[Works and Days](../sources/works-and-days.md) presents a strikingly different picture of Cronos's reign. The [Golden Age](../events/five-ages.md) took place "in the time of Cronos when he was reigning in heaven," and men "lived like gods without sorrow of heart, remote and free from toil and grief."[^wd-golden]

After the [Titanomachy](../events/titanomachy.md) and his imprisonment, Cronos was eventually released: "the father of men and gods released him from his bonds." He now rules the Islands of the Blessed, where the heroes of the fourth age "live untouched by sorrow... happy heroes for whom the grain-giving earth bears honey-sweet fruit flourishing thrice a year."[^wd-blessed]

This represents a **variant tradition** from the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md), where Cronos is portrayed solely as the tyrant who swallowed his children, with no mention of rehabilitation.

[^wd-golden]: "First of all the deathless gods who dwell on Olympus made a golden race of mortal men who lived in the time of Cronos when he was reigning in heaven. And they lived like gods without sorrow of heart, remote and free from toil and grief" (Works and Days 109-113, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^wd-blessed]: "they live untouched by sorrow in the islands of the blessed along the shore of deep swirling Ocean, happy heroes for whom the grain-giving earth bears honey-sweet fruit flourishing thrice a year, far from the deathless gods, and Cronos rules over them; for the father of men and gods released him from his bonds" (Works and Days 170-173)

## In the Bibliotheca

Apollodorus retells the castration and swallowing myths, with some notable differences from the Theogony.

### The Castration of Uranus

In Apollodorus, [Gaia](gaia.md) "gave Cronus an adamantine sickle" (the Theogony says "grey flint"). All the Titans attacked Uranus "all but [Oceanus](oceanus.md)," and Cronos "cut off his father's genitals and threw them into the sea."[^apd-cronos-castrate] The Theogony presents Cronos as acting alone in ambush; Apollodorus makes it a collective assault (with Oceanus as the sole abstainer).

After dethroning Uranus, the Titans "brought up their brethren who had been hurled down to Tartarus, and committed the sovereignty to Cronus."[^apd-cronos-rule] But Cronos then "again bound and shut them up in Tartarus."[^apd-cronos-rebind]

### Swallowing Order

Apollodorus specifies the order of swallowing: "His firstborn Hestia he swallowed, then Demeter and Hera, and after them Pluto and Poseidon."[^apd-cronos-swallow] This matches the Theogony's birth order but makes the sequence explicit.

### Chiron

Apollodorus confirms the [Epic Cycle](../sources/epic-cycle.md) tradition: "to Cronus and Philyra was born Chiron, a centaur of double form."[^apd-cronos-chiron]

[^apd-cronos-castrate]: "they, all but Ocean, attacked him, and Cronus cut off his father's genitals and threw them into the sea" (Bibliotheca 1.1.4, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-cronos-rule]: "having dethroned their father, they brought up their brethren who had been hurled down to Tartarus, and committed the sovereignty to Cronus" (Bibliotheca 1.1.4, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-cronos-rebind]: "he again bound and shut them up in Tartarus" (Bibliotheca 1.1.5, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-cronos-swallow]: "His firstborn Hestia he swallowed, then Demeter and Hera, and after them Pluto and Poseidon" (Bibliotheca 1.1.5, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-cronos-chiron]: "to Cronus and Philyra was born Chiron, a centaur of double form" (Bibliotheca 1.2.4, trans. Frazer)
