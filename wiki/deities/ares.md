## Epithets & Description

- **"Ares the shield-piercer"** / **"sacker of towns"** — ([Theogony](../sources/theogony.md) 934-936)

[Homeric Hymn VIII](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) provides an unusually detailed physical catalogue: "Ares, exceeding in strength, chariot-rider, golden-helmed, doughty in heart, shield-bearer, Saviour of cities, harnessed in bronze, strong of arm, unwearying, mighty with the spear, O defence of [Olympus](../places/olympus.md), father of warlike Victory, ally of [Themis](themis.md), stern governor of the rebellious, leader of righteous men, sceptred King of manliness."[^desc-hymn]

[^desc-hymn]: "Ares, exceeding in strength, chariot-rider, golden-helmed, doughty in heart, shield-bearer, Saviour of cities, harnessed in bronze, strong of arm, unwearying, mighty with the spear, O defence of Olympus, father of warlike Victory, ally of Themis, stern governor of the rebellious, leader of righteous men, sceptred King of manliness" (Homeric Hymn VIII to Ares 1-6, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Birth

[Hera](hera.md) "was joined in love with the king of gods and men, and brought forth Hebe and Ares and Eileithyia."[^theog-birth]

[^theog-birth]: "she was joined in love with the king of gods and men, and brought forth Hebe and Ares and Eileithyia" (Theogony 921-923, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Children

"Cytherea [[Aphrodite](aphrodite.md)] bare to Ares the shield-piercer Panic and Fear, terrible gods who drive in disorder the close ranks of men in numbing war, with the help of Ares, sacker of towns: and Harmonia whom high-spirited Cadmus made his wife."[^theog-children]

[^theog-children]: "Also Cytherea bare to Ares the shield-piercer Panic and Fear, terrible gods who drive in disorder the close ranks of men in numbing war, with the help of Ares, sacker of towns: and Harmonia whom high-spirited Cadmus made his wife" (Theogony 933-937)

## In the Iliad

### Bound by Otos and Ephialtes

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book V, Dione tells [Aphrodite](aphrodite.md) that Ares too has suffered at mortal hands: "So suffered Ares, when Otos and stalwart Ephialtes, sons of Aloeus, bound him in a strong prison-house; yea in a vessel of bronze lay he bound thirteen months. Then might Ares insatiate of battle have perished, but that the step-mother of Aloeus' sons, fair Eëriboia, gave tidings to [Hermes](hermes.md), and he stole away Ares, already pining; for the grievous prison-house was wearing him out."[^il5-bound]

### Leading the Trojans (Book V)

Ares enters the battle on the Trojan side at [Apollo](apollo.md)'s urging, "in the likeness of fleet Akamas, captain of the Thracians." He leads the Trojans alongside the personified Enyo, "she bringing ruthless turmoil of war, the while Ares wielded in his hands his monstrous spear, and ranged now before Hector's face, and now behind."[^il5-leading]

### Wounded by Diomedes and Athena

[Athena](athena.md) dons "the helm of [Hades](hades.md), that terrible Ares might not behold her," and drives Diomedes' chariot directly at Ares. When Ares thrusts his spear, "the bright-eyed goddess Athene with her hand seized the spear and thrust it up over the car, to spend itself in vain." Then "Diomedes of the loud war-cry attacked with spear of bronze; and Pallas Athene drave it home against Ares' nethermost belly, where his taslets were girt about him."[^il5-wound]

"Then brazen Ares bellowed loud as nine thousand warriors or ten thousand cry in battle as they join in strife and fray. Thereat trembling gat hold of Achaians and Trojans for fear, so mightily bellowed Ares insatiate of battle."[^il5-bellow]

### Zeus Rebukes Ares

Ares fled to [Olympus](../places/olympus.md) and complained to [Zeus](zeus.md) about [Athena](athena.md). Zeus responded: "Most hateful to me art thou of all gods that dwell in [Olympus](../places/olympus.md): thou ever lovest strife and wars and battles. Truly thy mother's spirit is intolerable, unyielding, even [Hera](hera.md)'s; her can I scarce rule with words." Yet he added: "mine offspring art thou, and to me thy mother bare thee. But wert thou born of any other god unto this violence, long ere this hadst thou been lower than the sons of Heaven."[^il5-rebuke]

Then "Paieon laid assuaging drugs upon the wound and healed him; seeing that verily he was of no mortal substance. Even as fig juice maketh haste to thicken white milk... even so swiftly healed he impetuous Ares. And Hebe bathed him, and clothed him in gracious raiment."[^il5-heal]

[^il5-bound]: "So suffered Ares, when Otos and stalwart Ephialtes, sons of Aloeus, bound him in a strong prison-house; yea in a vessel of bronze lay he bound thirteen months. Then might Ares insatiate of battle have perished, but that the step-mother of Aloeus' sons, fair Eëriboia, gave tidings to Hermes, and he stole away Ares, already pining; for the grievous prison-house was wearing him out" (Iliad V.2963-2968, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il5-leading]: "baleful Ares entered among the Trojan ranks and aroused them in the likeness of fleet Akamas, captain of the Thracians" ... "Ares led them on and dread Enyo, she bringing ruthless turmoil of war, the while Ares wielded in his hands his monstrous spear, and ranged now before Hector's face, and now behind" (Iliad V.3034-3036, 3156-3158)
[^il5-wound]: "Pallas Athene drave it home against Ares' nethermost belly, where his taslets were girt about him. There smote he him and wounded him, rending through his fair skin, and plucked forth the spear again" (Iliad V.3393-3396)
[^il5-bellow]: "brazen Ares bellowed loud as nine thousand warriors or ten thousand cry in battle as they join in strife and fray. Thereat trembling gat hold of Achaians and Trojans for fear, so mightily bellowed Ares insatiate of battle" (Iliad V.3396-3399)
[^il5-rebuke]: "Most hateful to me art thou of all gods that dwell in Olympus: thou ever lovest strife and wars and battles. Truly thy mother's spirit is intolerable, unyielding, even Hera's; her can I scarce rule with words... mine offspring art thou, and to me thy mother bare thee. But wert thou born of any other god unto this violence, long ere this hadst thou been lower than the sons of Heaven" (Iliad V.3424-3432)
[^il5-heal]: "Paieon laid assuaging drugs upon the wound and healed him; seeing that verily he was of no mortal substance. Even as fig juice maketh haste to thicken white milk, that is liquid but curdleth speedily as a man stirreth, even so swiftly healed he impetuous Ares. And Hebe bathed him, and clothed him in gracious raiment" (Iliad V.3439-3444)
