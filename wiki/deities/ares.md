## Overview

**Ares** is a son of [Zeus](zeus.md) and [Hera](hera.md), god of war.

## Epithets

From the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md):
- **"Ares the shield-piercer"** / **"sacker of towns"** — (Theogony 934-936)

[Homeric Hymn VIII](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) is the only hymn dedicated to Ares and provides the richest cluster of epithets for any deity:[^desc-hymn]
- **"exceeding in strength"** / **"strong of arm, unwearying"**
- **"shield-bearer"** / **"mighty with the spear"**
- **"chariot-rider"**
- **"Saviour of cities"** / **"defence of [Olympus](../places/olympus.md)"**
- **"father of warlike Victory"**
- **"ally of [Themis](themis.md)"** / **"stern governor of the rebellious"**
- **"leader of righteous men"** / **"sceptred King of manliness"**

From the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md):
- **"furious Ares"** / **"man-slaying Ares"** / **"Ares bane of mortals"** — common Iliad epithets
- **"most hateful to me... of all gods that hold Olympus"** — [Zeus](zeus.md)'s judgment (Iliad V)[^il5-hateful]

[^desc-hymn]: "Ares, exceeding in strength, chariot-rider, golden-helmed, doughty in heart, shield-bearer, Saviour of cities, harnessed in bronze, strong of arm, unwearying, mighty with the spear, O defence of Olympus, father of warlike Victory, ally of Themis, stern governor of the rebellious, leader of righteous men, sceptred King of manliness" (Homeric Hymn VIII to Ares 1-6, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^il5-hateful]: "Most hateful to me art thou of all gods that hold Olympus: for ever is strife dear to thee and wars and battles" (Iliad 5.518-519, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

## Appearance

In [Homeric Hymn VIII](../sources/homeric-hymns.md), Ares is **"golden-helmed"** and **"harnessed in bronze."** The hymn also places him uniquely among the celestial bodies: "who whirl your fiery sphere among the planets in their sevenfold courses through the aether wherein your blazing steeds ever bear you above the third firmament of heaven."[^desc-celestial]

On the [Shield of Heracles](../sources/shield-of-heracles.md), he is depicted in his war-chariot: "deadly Ares the spoil-winner himself. He held a spear in his hands and was urging on the footmen: **he was red with blood** as if he were slaying living men."[^sh-shield]

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) V, when wounded by [Diomedes](../heroes/diomedes.md) (guided by [Athena](athena.md)), he "bellowed loud as nine thousand warriors or ten thousand cry in battle."[^il5-bellow]

[^desc-celestial]: "who whirl your fiery sphere among the planets in their sevenfold courses through the aether wherein your blazing steeds ever bear you above the third firmament of heaven" (Homeric Hymn VIII to Ares 7-9)
[^il5-bellow]: "Then brazen Ares bellowed loud as nine thousand warriors or ten thousand cry in battle as they join in strife and fray" (Iliad 5.500-501, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

## Birth

[Hera](hera.md) "was joined in love with the king of gods and men, and brought forth Hebe and Ares and Eileithyia."[^theog-birth]

[^theog-birth]: "she was joined in love with the king of gods and men, and brought forth Hebe and Ares and Eileithyia" (Theogony 921-923, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Children

"Cytherea [[Aphrodite](aphrodite.md)] bare to Ares the shield-piercer Panic and Fear, terrible gods who drive in disorder the close ranks of men in numbing war, with the help of Ares, sacker of towns: and Harmonia whom high-spirited Cadmus made his wife."[^theog-children]

[^theog-children]: "Also Cytherea bare to Ares the shield-piercer Panic and Fear, terrible gods who drive in disorder the close ranks of men in numbing war, with the help of Ares, sacker of towns: and Harmonia whom high-spirited Cadmus made his wife" (Theogony 933-937)

## Powers

- **Terrifying war-cry:** "Brazen Ares bellowed loud as nine thousand warriors or ten thousand cry in battle... thereat trembling gat hold of Achaians and Trojans for fear."[^il5-bellow]
- **Shapeshifting:** He entered the Trojan ranks "in the likeness of fleet Akamas, captain of the Thracians."[^il5-leading]
- **Divine resilience:** Despite severe wounds, he healed rapidly — Paieon "laid assuaging drugs upon the wound and healed him; seeing that verily he was of no mortal substance. Even as fig juice maketh haste to thicken white milk... even so swiftly healed he."[^il5-heal]
- **Accompanied by personifications:** He fights with Fear (Phobos), Panic (Deimos), Flight, and Enyo at his side. On the [Shield of Heracles](../sources/shield-of-heracles.md), "Beside him stood Fear and Flight, eager to plunge amidst the fighting men."[^sh-shield]

## In the Shield of Heracles

In the [Shield of Heracles](../sources/shield-of-heracles.md), Ares fights alongside his son Cycnus against [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md). When Heracles kills Cycnus, Ares charges to avenge him, but [Athena](athena.md) deflects his spear and rebukes him: "Ares, check your fierce anger and matchless hands; for it is not ordained that you should kill Heracles, the bold-hearted son of Zeus."[^sh-athena] But "he uttered a great shout and waving his spears like fire, he rushed headlong at strong Heracles." Heracles then wounded him in the thigh, "and cast him flat upon the ground. And Panic and Dread quickly drove his smooth-wheeled chariot and horses near him and lifted him from the wide-pathed earth into his richly-wrought car."[^sh-wound]

On the shield itself, Ares appears in his chariot: "deadly Ares the spoil-winner himself. He held a spear in his hands and was urging on the footmen: he was red with blood as if he were slaying living men. Beside him stood Fear and Flight, eager to plunge amidst the fighting men."[^sh-shield]

[^sh-athena]: "Ares, check your fierce anger and matchless hands; for it is not ordained that you should kill Heracles, the bold-hearted son of Zeus, and strip off his rich armour. Come, then, cease fighting and do not withstand me" (Shield of Heracles 443-449, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^sh-wound]: "the son of Amphitryon, unsated of fierce battle, shrewdly wounded his thigh where it was exposed under his richly-wrought shield, and tare deep into his flesh with the spear-thrust and cast him flat upon the ground. And Panic and Dread quickly drove his smooth-wheeled chariot and horses near him and lifted him from the wide-pathed earth into his richly-wrought car" (Shield of Heracles 456-462)
[^sh-shield]: "deadly Ares the spoil-winner himself. He held a spear in his hands and was urging on the footmen: he was red with blood as if he were slaying living men, and he stood in his chariot. Beside him stood Fear and Flight, eager to plunge amidst the fighting men" (Shield of Heracles 191-196)

## In the Iliad

### Bound by Otos and Ephialtes

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book V, Dione tells [Aphrodite](aphrodite.md) that Ares too has suffered at mortal hands: "So suffered Ares, when Otos and stalwart Ephialtes, sons of Aloeus, bound him in a strong prison-house; yea in a vessel of bronze lay he bound thirteen months. Then might Ares insatiate of battle have perished, but that the step-mother of Aloeus' sons, fair Eëriboia, gave tidings to [Hermes](hermes.md), and he stole away Ares, already pining; for the grievous prison-house was wearing him out."[^il5-bound]

### Leading the Trojans (Book V)

Ares enters the battle on the Trojan side at [Apollo](apollo.md)'s urging, "in the likeness of fleet Akamas, captain of the Thracians." He leads the Trojans alongside the personified Enyo, "she bringing ruthless turmoil of war, the while Ares wielded in his hands his monstrous spear, and ranged now before [Hector](../heroes/hector.md)'s face, and now behind."[^il5-leading]

### Wounded by Diomedes and Athena

[Athena](athena.md) dons "the helm of [Hades](hades.md), that terrible Ares might not behold her," and drives Diomedes' chariot directly at Ares. When Ares thrusts his spear, "the bright-eyed goddess Athene with her hand seized the spear and thrust it up over the car, to spend itself in vain." Then "Diomedes of the loud war-cry attacked with spear of bronze; and Pallas Athene drave it home against Ares' nethermost belly, where his taslets were girt about him."[^il5-wound]

"Then brazen Ares bellowed loud as nine thousand warriors or ten thousand cry in battle as they join in strife and fray. Thereat trembling gat hold of Achaians and Trojans for fear, so mightily bellowed Ares insatiate of battle."[^il5-bellow]

### Zeus Rebukes Ares

Ares fled to [Olympus](../places/olympus.md) and complained to [Zeus](zeus.md) about [Athena](athena.md). Zeus responded: "Most hateful to me art thou of all gods that dwell in [Olympus](../places/olympus.md): thou ever lovest strife and wars and battles. Truly thy mother's spirit is intolerable, unyielding, even [Hera](hera.md)'s; her can I scarce rule with words." Yet he added: "mine offspring art thou, and to me thy mother bare thee. But wert thou born of any other god unto this violence, long ere this hadst thou been lower than the sons of Heaven."[^il5-rebuke]

Then "Paieon laid assuaging drugs upon the wound and healed him; seeing that verily he was of no mortal substance. Even as fig juice maketh haste to thicken white milk... even so swiftly healed he impetuous Ares. And Hebe bathed him, and clothed him in gracious raiment."[^il5-heal]

[^il5-bound]: "So suffered Ares, when Otos and stalwart Ephialtes, sons of Aloeus, bound him in a strong prison-house; yea in a vessel of bronze lay he bound thirteen months. Then might Ares insatiate of battle have perished, but that the step-mother of Aloeus' sons, fair Eëriboia, gave tidings to Hermes, and he stole away Ares, already pining; for the grievous prison-house was wearing him out" (Iliad 5.400-405, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il5-leading]: "baleful Ares entered among the Trojan ranks and aroused them in the likeness of fleet Akamas, captain of the Thracians" ... "Ares led them on and dread Enyo, she bringing ruthless turmoil of war, the while Ares wielded in his hands his monstrous spear, and ranged now before Hector's face, and now behind" (Iliad 5.473-475, 3156-3158)
[^il5-wound]: "Pallas Athene drave it home against Ares' nethermost belly, where his taslets were girt about him. There smote he him and wounded him, rending through his fair skin, and plucked forth the spear again" (Iliad 5.846-849)
[^il5-bellow]: "brazen Ares bellowed loud as nine thousand warriors or ten thousand cry in battle as they join in strife and fray. Thereat trembling gat hold of Achaians and Trojans for fear, so mightily bellowed Ares insatiate of battle" (Iliad 5.849-852)
[^il5-rebuke]: "Most hateful to me art thou of all gods that dwell in Olympus: thou ever lovest strife and wars and battles. Truly thy mother's spirit is intolerable, unyielding, even Hera's; her can I scarce rule with words... mine offspring art thou, and to me thy mother bare thee. But wert thou born of any other god unto this violence, long ere this hadst thou been lower than the sons of Heaven" (Iliad 5.878-886)
[^il5-heal]: "Paieon laid assuaging drugs upon the wound and healed him; seeing that verily he was of no mortal substance. Even as fig juice maketh haste to thicken white milk, that is liquid but curdleth speedily as a man stirreth, even so swiftly healed he impetuous Ares. And Hebe bathed him, and clothed him in gracious raiment" (Iliad 5.893-899)

## In the Odyssey

### The Song of Ares and Aphrodite (Book VIII)

In [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) Book VIII, the minstrel Demodocus sings the tale of Ares and [Aphrodite](aphrodite.md)'s adultery in [Hephaestus](hephaestus.md)'s house. "Ares of the golden rein kept no blind watch, what time he saw Hephaestus, the famed craftsman, depart afar." He enticed Aphrodite: "Come, my beloved, let us to bed, and take our pleasure of love, for Hephaestus is no longer among his own people; methinks he is already gone to Lemnos, to the Sintians, men of savage speech."[^od8-ares-entice]

They were trapped in Hephaestus's unbreakable net: "around them clung the cunning bonds of skilled Hephaestus, so that they could not move nor raise a limb."[^od8-trapped] After [Poseidon](poseidon.md) guaranteed the fine, "the twain, when they were freed from that strong bond, sprang up straightway, and departed, he to Thrace."[^od8-thrace]

[^od8-ares-entice]: "Ares of the golden rein kept no blind watch, what time he saw Hephaestus, the famed craftsman, depart afar. So he went on his way to the house of renowned Hephaestus, eager for the love of crowned Cytherea... 'Come, my beloved, let us to bed, and take our pleasure of love, for Hephaestus is no longer among his own people; methinks he is already gone to Lemnos, to the Sintians, men of savage speech'" (Odyssey 8.281-290, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od8-trapped]: "around them clung the cunning bonds of skilled Hephaestus, so that they could not move nor raise a limb" (Odyssey 8.293-294)
[^od8-thrace]: "the twain, when they were freed from that strong bond, sprang up straightway, and departed, he to Thrace" (Odyssey 8.360-361)

## In the Bibliotheca (1.4.4)

### Ares and Eos

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) mentions that [Eos](eos.md) (Dawn) "had bedded with Ares," which prompted [Aphrodite](aphrodite.md) to curse her with perpetual love for mortals.[^apd-ares-dawn]

> **NOTE:** This connects to the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) VIII account of Ares and Aphrodite's affair. The Bibliotheca adds the consequence: Aphrodite punished Eos for the liaison, explaining the series of mortal lovers (Orion, Tithonus, Cleitus) attributed to Eos elsewhere.

[^apd-ares-dawn]: "Aphrodite caused Dawn to be perpetually in love, because she had bedded with Ares" (Bibliotheca 1.4.4, trans. Frazer)

## In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md)

### Mars and Venus (4.167-189)

The [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md) retells the story of [Ares](ares.md) and [Aphrodite](aphrodite.md)'s adultery. [Helius](helius.md) "witnessed the loves of Mars and Venus" and told [Hephaestus](hephaestus.md). Hephaestus forged chains "delicate, fine, from which to fashion nets invisible, filmy of mesh and airy as the thread of insect-web" and drew them around the bed.[^met-ares-nets] When Ares appeared "with his paramour," they were "meshed in the chains" and could "not thence arise, nor could they else but lie in strict embrace." Hephaestus then "called the Gods, to witness. There they lay disgraced and bound."[^met-ares-trapped]

> **NOTE:** This version closely follows the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) VIII account but is more compressed, and Ovid adds the detail that Aphrodite subsequently took revenge on Helius for his disclosure (4.190ff).

[^met-ares-nets]: "he set to file out chains of brass, delicate, fine, from which to fashion nets invisible, filmy of mesh and airy as the thread of insect-web" (Metamorphoses 4.174-178, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-ares-trapped]: "Meshed in the chains they could not thence arise, nor could they else but lie in strict embrace,—cunningly thus entrapped by Vulcan's wit" (Metamorphoses 4.182-184, trans. Brookes More)

### Apotheosis of Romulus (14.805-828)

Mars petitioned [Jupiter](zeus.md) for the promised apotheosis of his son Romulus: the god "leaning on a spear, he mounted boldly into his chariot, and over bloodstained yoke and eager steeds he swung and cracked the loud-resounding lash."[^met-ares-chariot] He descended to the Palatine hill, where Romulus was giving laws, and "Mars caught him up. His mortal flesh dissolved into thin air, as when a ball of lead shot up from a broad sling melts all away and soon is lost in heaven."[^met-ares-romulus] Romulus was transformed into the god Quirinus: "A nobler shape was given him, one more fitted to adorn rich couches in high heaven, the shape divine of Quirinus clad in the trabea."[^met-ares-quirinus]

[^met-ares-chariot]: "leaning on a spear, he mounted boldly into his chariot, and over bloodstained yoke and eager steeds he swung and cracked the loud-resounding lash" (Metamorphoses 14.827-830, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-ares-romulus]: "Mars caught him up. His mortal flesh dissolved into thin air, as when a ball of lead shot up from a broad sling melts all away and soon is lost in heaven" (Metamorphoses 14.833-836)
[^met-ares-quirinus]: "A nobler shape was given him, one more fitted to adorn rich couches in high heaven, the shape divine of Quirinus clad in the trabea" (Metamorphoses 14.836-839)

## In the Bibliotheca (Book 2)

### The Belt of Hippolyte (2.5.9)

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) connects Ares to the Amazons through the belt of Hippolyte: "Hippolyte had the belt of Ares in token of her superiority to all the rest."[^apd-ares-belt] This belt was the object of [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md)' ninth labour — Admete, daughter of Eurystheus, desired it.

### Diomedes of Thrace and the Man-Eating Mares (2.5.8)

The eighth labour involved the mares of "Diomedes the Thracian," who "was a son of Ares and Cyrene, and he was king of the Bistones, a very warlike Thracian people, and he owned man-eating mares."[^apd-ares-diomedes] Heracles slew Diomedes and compelled the Bistones to flee.

### Cycnus Challenges Heracles (2.5.11, 2.7.7)

During the quest for the golden apples, "Cycnus, son of Ares and Pyrene, challenged him to single combat. Ares championed the cause of Cycnus and marshalled the combat, but a thunderbolt was hurled between the two and parted the combatants."[^apd-ares-cycnus-apples] Later, at Itonus, [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) was again "challenged to single combat by Cycnus a son of Ares and Pelopia; and closing with him Hercules slew him also."[^apd-ares-cycnus-itonus]

[^apd-ares-belt]: "Hippolyte had the belt of Ares in token of her superiority to all the rest" (Bibliotheca 2.5.9, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-ares-diomedes]: "Diomedes was a son of Ares and Cyrene, and he was king of the Bistones, a very warlike Thracian people, and he owned man-eating mares" (Bibliotheca 2.5.8, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-ares-cycnus-apples]: "Cycnus, son of Ares and Pyrene, challenged him to single combat. Ares championed the cause of Cycnus and marshalled the combat, but a thunderbolt was hurled between the two and parted the combatants" (Bibliotheca 2.5.11, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-ares-cycnus-itonus]: "he was challenged to single combat by Cycnus a son of Ares and Pelopia; and closing with him Hercules slew him also" (Bibliotheca 2.7.7, trans. J.G. Frazer)

## In the Bibliotheca (Book 1)

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) confirms the Aloads' imprisonment of Ares and adds that "they put Ares in bonds" and that "[Hermes](hermes.md) rescued Ares by stealth."[^apd-ares-bonds] The Iliad V version says he was imprisoned thirteen months in a bronze vessel and was already "pining" when freed.

The Bibliotheca also names Ares as a possible father of Meleager: "Althaea had also a son Meleager, by Oeneus, though they say that he was begotten by Ares."[^apd-meleager] Ares additionally appears in the Argonaut catalogue as father of Ascalaphus and Ialmenus.[^apd-argo-sons]

[^apd-ares-bonds]: "they put Ares in bonds. However, Hermes rescued Ares by stealth" (Bibliotheca 1.7.4, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-meleager]: "Althaea had also a son Meleager, by Oeneus, though they say that he was begotten by Ares" (Bibliotheca 1.8.2, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-argo-sons]: "Ascalaphus and Ialmenus, sons of Ares" (Bibliotheca 1.9.16, trans. Frazer)
