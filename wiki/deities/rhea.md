## Overview

**Rhea** is a [Titan](titans.md), daughter of [Gaia](gaia.md) and [Uranus](uranus.md), and mother of the Olympian gods by [Cronos](cronos.md).

## Mythology

### The Birth of the Olympians

Rhea bore "splendid children" to [Cronos](cronos.md): "[Hestia](hestia.md), [Demeter](demeter.md), and gold-shod [Hera](hera.md) and strong [Hades](hades.md), pitiless in heart, who dwells under the earth, and the loud-crashing Earth-Shaker [[Poseidon](poseidon.md)], and wise [Zeus](zeus.md), father of gods and men, by whose thunder the wide earth is shaken."[^theog-children]

[^theog-children]: "Rhea was subject in love to Cronos and bare splendid children, Hestia, Demeter, and gold-shod Hera and strong Hades, pitiless in heart, who dwells under the earth, and the loud-crashing Earth-Shaker, and wise Zeus, father of gods and men, by whose thunder the wide earth is shaken" (Theogony 453-458, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

### Cronos Swallows His Children

"Great [Cronos](cronos.md) swallowed [each child] as each came forth from the womb to his mother's knees," because "he learned from [Earth](gaia.md) and starry [Heaven](uranus.md) that he was destined to be overcome by his own son." This brought "unceasing grief" to Rhea.[^theog-swallow]

[^theog-swallow]: "These great Cronos swallowed as each came forth from the womb to his mother's knees... For he learned from Earth and starry Heaven that he was destined to be overcome by his own son... Therefore he kept no blind outlook, but watched and swallowed down his children: and unceasing grief seized Rhea" (Theogony 459-467)

### Saving Zeus

When Rhea was about to bear [Zeus](zeus.md), "she besought her own dear parents, [Earth](gaia.md) and starry [Heaven](uranus.md), to devise some plan with her that the birth of her dear child might be concealed, and that retribution might overtake great, crafty [Cronos](cronos.md)."[^theog-plan]

They sent her to Lyctus in Crete. [Gaia](gaia.md) received the newborn Zeus, carried him "swiftly through the black night to Lyctus first, and took him in her arms and hid him in a remote cave beneath the secret places of the holy earth on thick-wooded Mount Aegeum."[^theog-cave]

To Cronos, Rhea gave "a great stone wrapped in swaddling clothes. Then he took it in his hands and thrust it down into his belly: wretch! he knew not in his heart that in place of the stone his son was left behind."[^theog-stone]

[^theog-plan]: "she besought her own dear parents, Earth and starry Heaven, to devise some plan with her that the birth of her dear child might be concealed, and that retribution might overtake great, crafty Cronos for his own father and also for the children whom he had swallowed down" (Theogony 468-473)
[^theog-cave]: "Him did vast Earth receive from Rhea in wide Crete to nourish and to bring up. Thither came Earth carrying him swiftly through the black night to Lyctus first, and took him in her arms and hid him in a remote cave beneath the secret places of the holy earth on thick-wooded Mount Aegeum" (Theogony 477-480)
[^theog-stone]: "to the mightily ruling son of Heaven, the earlier king of the gods, she gave a great stone wrapped in swaddling clothes. Then he took it in his hands and thrust it down into his belly: wretch! he knew not in his heart that in place of the stone his son was left behind" (Theogony 481-485)

## In the Bibliotheca

Apollodorus adds specific details to the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md)'s account of [Zeus](zeus.md)'s birth. Rhea "repaired to Crete, when she was big with Zeus, and brought him forth in a cave of Dicte."[^apd-rhea-crete] She entrusted him to "the Curetes and to the nymphs Adrastia and Ida, daughters of Melisseus, to nurse."[^apd-rhea-nurses] The child was fed "on the milk of Amalthea," while "the Curetes in arms guarded the babe in the cave, clashing their spears on their shields in order that Cronus might not hear the child's voice."[^apd-rhea-curetes]

These details — the cave of Dicte specifically (the Theogony says Lyctus/Mount Aegeum), the named nurses Adrastia and Ida, the goat Amalthea, and the armed Curetes clashing weapons — go well beyond the Theogony's briefer account.

[^apd-rhea-crete]: "Rhea repaired to Crete, when she was big with Zeus, and brought him forth in a cave of Dicte" (Bibliotheca 1.1.6, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-rhea-nurses]: "She gave him to the Curetes and to the nymphs Adrastia and Ida, daughters of Melisseus, to nurse" (Bibliotheca 1.1.6, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-rhea-curetes]: "these nymphs fed the child on the milk of Amalthea; and the Curetes in arms guarded the babe in the cave, clashing their spears on their shields in order that Cronus might not hear the child's voice" (Bibliotheca 1.1.7, trans. Frazer)
