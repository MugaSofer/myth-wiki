## Variant Traditions

### Mother's Name

The [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md) names Selene's mother as [Theia](theia.md). [Homeric Hymn XXXI](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) (to [Helius](helius.md)) gives the alternate name Euryphaessa ("the far-shining one"): "[Hyperion](hyperion.md) wedded glorious Euryphaessa, his own sister, who bare him lovely children, rosy-armed [Eos](eos.md) and rich-tressed Selene and tireless [Helius](helius.md)."[^hh31-mother]

[^hh31-mother]: "Hyperion wedded glorious Euryphaessa, his own sister, who bare him lovely children, rosy-armed Eos and rich-tressed Selene and tireless Helios who is like the deathless gods" (Homeric Hymn XXXI to Helios 2-5, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Children

"Once the Son of [Cronos](cronos.md) [[Zeus](zeus.md)] was joined with her in love; and she conceived and bare a daughter Pandia, exceeding lovely amongst the deathless gods."[^hh32-pandia]

[^hh32-pandia]: "Once the Son of Cronos was joined with her in love; and she conceived and bare a daughter Pandia, exceeding lovely amongst the deathless gods" (Homeric Hymn XXXII to Selene 14-16, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## In the Bibliotheca

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) adds the story of Selene and Endymion. Endymion "was of surpassing beauty" and "the Moon fell in love with him." [Zeus](zeus.md) allowed Endymion to choose whatever he wished, "and he chose to sleep for ever, remaining deathless and ageless."[^apd-endymion]

This is the earliest surviving prose account of the Endymion myth and is the first mention of Selene as a lover in any source processed for this wiki.

[^apd-endymion]: "As he was of surpassing beauty, the Moon fell in love with him, and Zeus allowed him to choose what he would, and he chose to sleep for ever, remaining deathless and ageless" (Bibliotheca 1.7.5, trans. Frazer)
