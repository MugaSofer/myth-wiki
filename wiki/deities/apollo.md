## Overview

**Apollo** is a son of [Zeus](zeus.md) and Leto, and twin brother of [Artemis](artemis.md).

## Epithets & Description

Apollo is described with more epithets than almost any other deity:

- **"far-shooting Apollo"** / **"who shoots afar"** — the most frequent epithet ([Theogony](../sources/theogony.md) 94; Hymn III 1, etc.)
- **"Phoebus Apollo"** — used throughout the Hymn to Apollo
- **"god of the silver bow"** — (Hymn III 140, 215)
- **"bearer of the golden blade"** — (Hymn III 123)[^desc-blade]
- **"the long-haired god"** — (Hymn III 134)[^desc-longhaired]
- **"the Pythian"** — from the rotting (*pythein*) of the dragon he slew (Hymn III 372-374)
- **"Apollo Delphinius"** — from his dolphin form (Hymn III 496)

At his birth he was "swathed... in a white garment of fine texture, new-woven, and fastened a golden band about" him.[^desc-birth] On [Olympus](../places/olympus.md), a vivid physical picture: "Apollo plays his lyre stepping high and featly and a radiance shines around him, the gleaming of his feet and close-woven vest."[^desc-radiance]

[^desc-blade]: "Leto did not give Apollo, bearer of the golden blade, her breast; but Themis duly poured nectar and ambrosia" (Homeric Hymn III to Apollo 123-124, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^desc-longhaired]: "So said Phoebus, the long-haired god who shoots afar and began to walk upon the wide-pathed earth; and all goddesses were amazed at him" (Homeric Hymn III to Apollo 134-135)
[^desc-birth]: "all the goddesses washed you purely and cleanly with sweet water, and swathed you in a white garment of fine texture, new-woven, and fastened a golden band about you" (Homeric Hymn III to Apollo 120-122)
[^desc-radiance]: "Apollo plays his lyre stepping high and featly and a radiance shines around him, the gleaming of his feet and close-woven vest" (Homeric Hymn III to Apollo 202-203)

## Birth

"Leto was joined in love with [Zeus](zeus.md) who holds the aegis, and bare Apollo and [Artemis](artemis.md) delighting in arrows, children lovely above all the sons of Heaven."[^theog-birth]

[^theog-birth]: "Leto was joined in love with Zeus who holds the aegis, and bare Apollo and Artemis delighting in arrows, children lovely above all the sons of Heaven" (Theogony 918-920, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Domains

"Through the [Muses](muses.md) and far-shooting Apollo... there are singers and harpers upon the earth."[^theog-music]

[^theog-music]: "For it is through the Muses and far-shooting Apollo that there are singers and harpers upon the earth" (Theogony 94-95)

## Birth on Delos (Hymn to Apollo)

The [Homeric Hymn to Apollo](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) (III) describes his birth at length. Leto wandered through many lands seeking a place to give birth, but "they greatly trembled and feared, and none, not even the richest of them, dared receive Phoebus." Only Delos agreed, after Leto swore an oath that Apollo would build his first temple there.[^hh3-delos]

[Hera](hera.md) kept Eileithyia (goddess of childbirth) away "through envy, because Leto with the lovely tresses was soon to bear a son faultless and strong." The other goddesses sent [Iris](iris.md) to fetch her. When Eileithyia arrived, "the pains of birth seized Leto, and she longed to bring forth; so she cast her arms about a palm tree and kneeled on the soft meadow while the earth laughed for joy beneath. Then the child leaped forth to the light."[^hh3-birth]

### First Words

"As soon as you had tasted that divine heavenly food, O Phoebus, you could no longer then be held by golden cords nor confined with bands, but all their ends were undone." Apollo immediately declared: "The lyre and the curved bow shall ever be dear to me, and I will declare to men the unfailing will of [Zeus](zeus.md)."[^hh3-words]

## On Olympus

The Hymn describes Apollo's entrance among the gods: "As he goes through the house of [Zeus](zeus.md), the gods tremble before him and all spring up from their seats when he draws near, as he bends his bright bow." Only Leto stays calm, unstringing his bow and leading him to his seat. When he plays, "all the [Muses](muses.md) together, voice sweetly answering voice, hymn the unending gifts the gods enjoy," while the [Graces](graces.md) and [Artemis](artemis.md) dance, and "[Ares](ares.md) and the keen-eyed Slayer of Argus [[Hermes](hermes.md)]" sport among them.[^hh3-olympus]

## The Dragon and the Oracle at Pytho (Delphi)

Apollo travelled seeking a site for his oracle. At Crisa beneath Parnassus, "the lord Phoebus Apollo resolved to make his lovely temple." Near it, "with his strong bow the lord, the son of [Zeus](zeus.md), killed the bloated, great she-dragon, a fierce monster wont to do great mischief to men upon earth." The dragon had nursed Typhaon (born of [Hera](hera.md) alone in anger at [Zeus](zeus.md) for birthing [Athena](athena.md)).[^hh3-dragon]

Apollo boasted over her: "Now rot here upon the soil that feeds man! You at least shall live no more to be a fell bane to men." "The holy strength of [Helios](helius.md) made her rot away there; wherefore the place is now called Pytho, and men call the lord Apollo by another name, Pythian."[^hh3-pytho]

## The Cretan Priests

Apollo then chose his ministers by taking the form of a dolphin and leaping aboard a Cretan ship, guiding it to Crisa. He revealed himself: "I am the son of [Zeus](zeus.md); Apollo is my name... here you shall keep my rich temple that is greatly honoured among men." He instructed them: "in as much as at the first on the hazy sea I sprang upon the swift ship in the form of a dolphin, pray to me as Apollo Delphinius."[^hh3-priests]

[^hh3-delos]: "they greatly trembled and feared, and none, not even the richest of them, dared receive Phoebus, until queenly Leto set foot on Delos and uttered winged words" (Homeric Hymn III to Apollo 46-49, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^hh3-birth]: "the pains of birth seized Leto, and she longed to bring forth; so she cast her arms about a palm tree and kneeled on the soft meadow while the earth laughed for joy beneath. Then the child leaped forth to the light, and all the goddesses washed you purely and cleanly with sweet water" (Homeric Hymn III to Apollo 115-120)
[^hh3-words]: "The lyre and the curved bow shall ever be dear to me, and I will declare to men the unfailing will of Zeus" (Homeric Hymn III to Apollo 131-132)
[^hh3-olympus]: "As he goes through the house of Zeus, the gods tremble before him and all spring up from their seats when he draws near, as he bends his bright bow. But Leto alone stays by the side of Zeus who delights in thunder" (Homeric Hymn III to Apollo 2-7)
[^hh3-dragon]: "there with his strong bow the lord, the son of Zeus, killed the bloated, great she-dragon, a fierce monster wont to do great mischief to men upon earth" (Homeric Hymn III to Apollo 300-304)
[^hh3-pytho]: "the holy strength of Helios made her rot away there; wherefore the place is now called Pytho, and men call the lord Apollo by another name, Pythian; because on that spot the power of piercing Helios made the monster rot away" (Homeric Hymn III to Apollo 371-374)
[^hh3-priests]: "I am the son of Zeus; Apollo is my name: but you I brought here over the wide gulf of the sea, meaning you no hurt; nay, here you shall keep my rich temple that is greatly honoured among men... in as much as at the first on the hazy sea I sprang upon the swift ship in the form of a dolphin, pray to me as Apollo Delphinius" (Homeric Hymn III to Apollo 480-496)

## In the Iliad

### The Plague (Book I)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book I, Apollo sends a plague upon the Greek army because Agamemnon dishonoured his priest Chryses. "Phoebus Apollo heard him, and came down from the peaks of Olympus wroth at heart, bearing on his shoulders his bow and covered quiver. And the arrows clanged upon his shoulders in wrath, as the god moved; and he descended like to night." He "sate him aloof from the ships, and let an arrow fly; and there was heard a dread clanging of the silver bow. First did he assail the mules and fleet dogs, but afterward, aiming at the men his piercing dart, he smote; and the pyres of the dead burnt continually in multitude."[^il1-plague]

The plague continued for nine days until the Greeks returned Chryses's daughter and made sacrifice; then "Apollo the Far-darter sent them a favouring gale."[^il1-favour]

[^il1-plague]: "Phoebus Apollo heard him, and came down from the peaks of Olympus wroth at heart, bearing on his shoulders his bow and covered quiver. And the arrows clanged upon his shoulders in wrath, as the god moved; and he descended like to night. Then he sate him aloof from the ships, and let an arrow fly; and there was heard a dread clanging of the silver bow" (Iliad I.43-49, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il1-favour]: "Apollo the Far-darter sent them a favouring gale" (Iliad I.479)
