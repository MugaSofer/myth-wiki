## Epithets

Apollo is described with more epithets than almost any other deity:

- **"far-shooting Apollo"** / **"who shoots afar"** — the most frequent epithet ([Theogony](../sources/theogony.md) 94; Hymn III 1, etc.)
- **"Phoebus Apollo"** — used throughout the Hymn to Apollo
- **"god of the [silver bow](../objects/apollos-bow.md)"** — (Hymn III 140, 215)

## Appearance

At his birth he was "swathed... in a white garment of fine texture, new-woven, and fastened a golden band about" him.[^desc-birth] On [Olympus](../places/olympus.md), a vivid physical picture: "Apollo plays his lyre stepping high and featly and a radiance shines around him, the gleaming of his feet and close-woven vest."[^desc-radiance]

In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md), Apollo appears in humble guise while wandering the plains of Pylos: "his shoulders covered with a shepherd's skin, his left hand holding his long shepherd's staff, his right hand busied with the seven reeds of seven sizes."[^met-apo-shepherd]

When he reveals himself to the Cretan sailors at Crisa, his divine radiance is blinding: "like a star at noonday, the lord, far-working Apollo, leaped from the ship: flashes of fire flew from him thick and their brightness reached to heaven."[^desc-star] In human form he appears "brisk and sturdy, in the prime of his youth, while his broad shoulders were covered with his hair."[^desc-human]

[^desc-birth]: "all the goddesses washed you purely and cleanly with sweet water, and swathed you in a white garment of fine texture, new-woven, and fastened a golden band about you" (Homeric Hymn III to Apollo 120-122)
[^desc-radiance]: "Apollo plays his lyre stepping high and featly and a radiance shines around him, the gleaming of his feet and close-woven vest" (Homeric Hymn III to Apollo 202-203)
[^desc-star]: "like a star at noonday, the lord, far-working Apollo, leaped from the ship: flashes of fire flew from him thick and their brightness reached to heaven" (Homeric Hymn III to Apollo 440-443)

[^desc-human]: "brisk and sturdy, in the prime of his youth, while his broad shoulders were covered with his hair" (Homeric Hymn III to Apollo 449-450)

## Powers

- **Plague and pestilence:** His arrows bring disease. In the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md), he sends plague on the Greek camp: "he descended like to night... the arrows clanged upon his shoulders in wrath... and there was heard a dread clanging of the silver bow."[^il1-plague] He also sent a pestilence on Troy when Laomedon refused to pay for its walls.[^apd-apo-troy]
- **Sudden death:** His arrows bring painless death to men, as [Artemis](artemis.md)'s do to women. In the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md), he slays with "the visitation of his gentle shafts."[^od15-syria]
- **Prophecy:** At birth he declared: "The lyre and the curved bow shall ever be dear to me, and I will declare to men the unfailing will of [Zeus](zeus.md)."[^hh3-words] He founded the oracle at Delphi.[^hh3-pytho]
- **Music:** "Through the [Muses](muses.md) and far-shooting Apollo... there are singers and harpers upon the earth."[^theog-music] On [Olympus](../places/olympus.md), "the gods tremble before him" when he plays, and "a soft longing" takes hold of all who hear.[^hh3-olympus]
- **Shapeshifting:** He took the form of a dolphin to guide the Cretan priests to Delphi.[^hh3-priests]
- **Favouring wind:** After proper sacrifice, "Apollo the Far-darter sent them a favouring gale."[^il1-favour]
- **Divine radiance:** When he reveals himself, "flashes of fire flew from him thick and their brightness reached to heaven."[^desc-star]
- **Transformation by curse:** When the raven reported Coronis's infidelity, "Apollo cursed the raven that brought the tidings and made him black instead of white, as he had been before."[^apd-raven]
- **Bestowing fertility:** During his servitude to Admetus, Apollo "caused all the cows to drop twins" — a power of miraculous fecundity over livestock.[^apd-admetus-twins]

## Birth

"Leto was joined in love with [Zeus](zeus.md) who holds the aegis, and bare Apollo and [Artemis](artemis.md) delighting in arrows, children lovely above all the sons of Heaven."[^theog-birth]

[^theog-birth]: "Leto was joined in love with Zeus who holds the aegis, and bare Apollo and Artemis delighting in arrows, children lovely above all the sons of Heaven" (Theogony 918-920, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Domains

"Through the [Muses](muses.md) and far-shooting Apollo... there are singers and harpers upon the earth."[^theog-music]

[^theog-music]: "For it is through the Muses and far-shooting Apollo that there are singers and harpers upon the earth" (Theogony 94-95)

## Birth on Delos (Hymn to Apollo)

The [Homeric Hymn to Apollo](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) (III) describes his birth at length. Leto wandered through many lands seeking a place to give birth, but "they greatly trembled and feared, and none, not even the richest of them, dared receive Phoebus." Only Delos agreed, after Leto swore an oath that Apollo would build his first temple there.[^hh3-delos]

[Hera](hera.md) kept Eileithyia (goddess of childbirth) away "through envy, because Leto with the lovely tresses was soon to bear a son faultless and strong." The other goddesses sent [Iris](iris.md) to fetch her. When Eileithyia arrived, "the pains of birth seized Leto, and she longed to bring forth; so she cast her arms about a palm tree and kneeled on the soft meadow while the earth laughed for joy beneath. Then the child leaped forth to the light."[^hh3-birth]

### First Words

"As soon as you had tasted that divine heavenly food, O Phoebus, you could no longer then be held by golden cords nor confined with bands, but all their ends were undone." Apollo immediately declared: "The lyre and the curved bow shall ever be dear to me, and I will declare to men the unfailing will of [Zeus](zeus.md)."[^hh3-words]

## On Olympus

The Hymn describes Apollo's entrance among the gods: "As he goes through the house of [Zeus](zeus.md), the gods tremble before him and all spring up from their seats when he draws near, as he bends his bright bow." Only Leto stays calm, unstringing his bow and leading him to his seat. When he plays, "all the [Muses](muses.md) together, voice sweetly answering voice, hymn the unending gifts the gods enjoy," while the [Graces](graces.md) and [Artemis](artemis.md) dance, and "[Ares](ares.md) and the keen-eyed Slayer of Argus [[Hermes](hermes.md)]" sport among them.[^hh3-olympus]

## The Dragon and the Oracle at Pytho (Delphi)

Apollo travelled seeking a site for his oracle. At Crisa beneath Parnassus, "the lord Phoebus Apollo resolved to make his lovely temple." Near it, "with his strong bow the lord, the son of [Zeus](zeus.md), killed the bloated, great she-dragon, a fierce monster wont to do great mischief to men upon earth." The dragon had nursed Typhaon (born of [Hera](hera.md) alone in anger at [Zeus](zeus.md) for birthing [Athena](athena.md)).[^hh3-dragon]

Apollo boasted over her: "Now rot here upon the soil that feeds man! You at least shall live no more to be a fell bane to men." "The holy strength of [Helios](helius.md) made her rot away there; wherefore the place is now called Pytho, and men call the lord Apollo by another name, Pythian."[^hh3-pytho]

## The Cretan Priests

Apollo then chose his ministers by taking the form of a dolphin and leaping aboard a Cretan ship, guiding it to Crisa. He revealed himself: "I am the son of [Zeus](zeus.md); Apollo is my name... here you shall keep my rich temple that is greatly honoured among men." He instructed them: "in as much as at the first on the hazy sea I sprang upon the swift ship in the form of a dolphin, pray to me as Apollo Delphinius."[^hh3-priests]

[^hh3-delos]: "they greatly trembled and feared, and none, not even the richest of them, dared receive Phoebus, until queenly Leto set foot on Delos and uttered winged words" (Homeric Hymn III to Apollo 46-49, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^hh3-birth]: "the pains of birth seized Leto, and she longed to bring forth; so she cast her arms about a palm tree and kneeled on the soft meadow while the earth laughed for joy beneath. Then the child leaped forth to the light, and all the goddesses washed you purely and cleanly with sweet water" (Homeric Hymn III to Apollo 115-120)
[^hh3-words]: "The lyre and the curved bow shall ever be dear to me, and I will declare to men the unfailing will of Zeus" (Homeric Hymn III to Apollo 131-132)
[^hh3-olympus]: "As he goes through the house of Zeus, the gods tremble before him and all spring up from their seats when he draws near, as he bends his bright bow. But Leto alone stays by the side of Zeus who delights in thunder" (Homeric Hymn III to Apollo 2-7)
[^hh3-dragon]: "there with his strong bow the lord, the son of Zeus, killed the bloated, great she-dragon, a fierce monster wont to do great mischief to men upon earth" (Homeric Hymn III to Apollo 300-304)
[^hh3-pytho]: "the holy strength of Helios made her rot away there; wherefore the place is now called Pytho, and men call the lord Apollo by another name, Pythian; because on that spot the power of piercing Helios made the monster rot away" (Homeric Hymn III to Apollo 371-374)
[^hh3-priests]: "I am the son of Zeus; Apollo is my name: but you I brought here over the wide gulf of the sea, meaning you no hurt; nay, here you shall keep my rich temple that is greatly honoured among men... in as much as at the first on the hazy sea I sprang upon the swift ship in the form of a dolphin, pray to me as Apollo Delphinius" (Homeric Hymn III to Apollo 480-496)

## In the [Argonautica](../sources/argonautica.md)

Apollo appears three times in the Argonautica. In Book II, as the Argonauts rested on the island of Thynias before dawn, Apollo passed overhead on his way from Lycia to the Hyperboreans. His golden locks flowed in clusters about his cheeks, he carried a silver bow and a quiver on his back, and the island quaked beneath his feet. The heroes were awestruck and dared not look directly at the god.[^arg-apo-thynias] At Orpheus's suggestion, the Argonauts built an altar on the spot and named the island the Sacred Isle of Apollo.

Earlier in Book I, [Orpheus](../heroes/orpheus.md) sang of Apollo's slaying of the serpent Delphyne at Parnassus as part of his cosmogonic song.[^arg-apo-delphyne] And near the voyage's end, Apollo appeared again from the Melantian rocks in darkness, flashing his golden bow and illuminating the night — by this light the Argonauts discovered the island of Anaphe and made landfall.[^arg-apo-anaphe]

Apollo's sons appear as Argonauts: Idmon (who came knowing his fate, the son of Leto's son himself), Aristaeus (born to Cyrene in Libya, called "Hunter" and "Shepherd" by the Haemonians), and Mopsus (skilled in the seer's art).[^arg-apo-sons]

[^arg-apo-thynias]: "beneath his feet all the island quaked, and the waves surged high on the beach. Helpless amazement seized them as they looked; and no one dared to gaze face to face into the fair eyes of the god. And they stood with heads bowed to the ground; but he, far off, passed on to the sea through the air" (Argonautica 2.674-684, trans. R.C. Seaton)
[^arg-apo-delphyne]: "how once beneath the rocky ridge of Parnassus he slew with his bow the monster Delphyne, he, still young and beardless, still rejoicing in his long tresses" (Argonautica 2.706-707, trans. R.C. Seaton)
[^arg-apo-anaphe]: "Then darting upon one of the twin peaks, thou raisedst aloft in thy right hand thy golden bow; and the bow flashed a dazzling gleam all round. And to their sight appeared a small island of the Sporades" (Argonautica 4.1706-1711, trans. R.C. Seaton)
[^arg-apo-sons]: "Idmon came last of all them that dwelt at Argos, for though he had learnt his own fate by augury, he came, that the people might not grudge him fair renown. He was not in truth the son of Abas, but Leto's son himself begat him" (Argonautica 1.139-145, trans. R.C. Seaton); "to Phoebus she bore Aristaeus whom the Haemonians, rich in corn-land, call 'Hunter' and 'Shepherd'" (Argonautica 2.500-503); Mopsus "skilled in the seer's art" (Argonautica 1.65)

## In the Iliad

### The Plague (Book I)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book I, Apollo sends a plague upon the Greek army because Agamemnon dishonoured his priest Chryses. "Phoebus Apollo heard him, and came down from the peaks of Olympus wroth at heart, bearing on his shoulders his bow and covered quiver. And the arrows clanged upon his shoulders in wrath, as the god moved; and he descended like to night." He "sate him aloof from the ships, and let an arrow fly; and there was heard a dread clanging of the silver bow. First did he assail the mules and fleet dogs, but afterward, aiming at the men his piercing dart, he smote; and the pyres of the dead burnt continually in multitude."[^il1-plague]

The plague continued for nine days until the Greeks returned Chryses's daughter and made sacrifice; then "Apollo the Far-darter sent them a favouring gale."[^il1-favour]

[^il1-plague]: "Phoebus Apollo heard him, and came down from the peaks of Olympus wroth at heart, bearing on his shoulders his bow and covered quiver. And the arrows clanged upon his shoulders in wrath, as the god moved; and he descended like to night. Then he sate him aloof from the ships, and let an arrow fly; and there was heard a dread clanging of the silver bow" (Iliad 1.43-49, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il1-favour]: "Apollo the Far-darter sent them a favouring gale" (Iliad 1.302)
[^apd-raven]: "Apollo cursed the raven that brought the tidings and made him black instead of white, as he had been before; but he killed Coronis" (Bibliotheca 3.10.3, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-admetus-twins]: "he went to Admetus, son of Pheres, at Pherae, and served him as a herdsman, and caused all the cows to drop twins" (Bibliotheca 3.10.4, trans. J.G. Frazer)

### Meeting Athena / Arranging the Duel (Book VII)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book VII, when [Athena](athena.md) descends from Olympus to aid the Greeks, "Apollo rose to meet her, for he beheld her from Pergamos, and would have victory for the Trojans." The two gods meet by the oak tree, and Apollo proposes a halt to the general battle by having Hector challenge a single champion. Athena agrees.[^il7-meeting]

They then sit together "in the likeness of vulture birds" on the oak "holy to aegis-bearing father [Zeus](zeus.md), rejoicing in their warriors."[^il7-vultures]

During the duel between Aias and Hector, when Aias knocks Hector down with a great stone, "Apollo straightway raised him up."[^il7-raises]

### Apollo's Helm Saves Hector (Book XI)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book XI, Diomedes hurls his spear at Hector's head, hitting the crest, but "bronze by bronze was turned, nor reached his fair flesh, for it was stopped by the threefold helm with its socket, that Phoebus Apollo to Hector gave."[^il11-helm] Diomedes himself recognises the divine protection: "now hath Phoebus Apollo saved thee, to whom thou must surely pray when thou goest amid the clash of spears."[^il11-saved]

[^il11-helm]: "bronze by bronze was turned, nor reached his fair flesh, for it was stopped by the threefold helm with its socket, that Phoebus Apollo to Hector gave" (Iliad 11.354-356, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il11-saved]: "now hath Phoebus Apollo saved thee, to whom thou must surely pray when thou goest amid the clash of spears" (Iliad 11.366-367)

### Built Troy's Wall for Laomedon (Book VII)

[Poseidon](poseidon.md) complains to [Zeus](zeus.md) about the Achaian wall: "men will forget the wall that I and Phoebus Apollo built with travail for the hero Laomedon."[^il7-wall] This is a passing but significant reference to Apollo and Poseidon's forced service to the mortal king Laomedon — building Troy's walls.

[^il7-meeting]: "Apollo rose to meet her, for he beheld her from Pergamos, and would have victory for the Trojans. So the twain met each the other by the oak-tree. To her spake first king Apollo son of Zeus: 'Why now art thou come thus eagerly from Olympus, thou daughter of great Zeus?'" (Iliad 7.26-30, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il7-vultures]: "Athene withal and Apollo of the silver bow, in the likeness of vulture birds, sate them upon a tall oak holy to aegis-bearing father Zeus, rejoicing in their warriors" (Iliad 7.65-67)
[^il7-raises]: "Apollo straightway raised him up" (Iliad 7.269)
[^il7-wall]: "men will forget the wall that I and Phoebus Apollo built with travail for the hero Laomedon" (Iliad 7.448-449)

### Healing Glaukos (Book XVI)

When Glaukos prays for healing so he can defend Sarpedon's body, "Phoebus Apollo heard him. Straightway he made his pains to cease, and in the grievous wound stanched the black blood, and put courage into his heart. And Glaukos knew it within him, and was glad, for that the great god speedily heard his prayer."[^il16-glaukos]

### Defending Troy's Wall / Killing Patroklos (Book XVI)

Apollo drives Patroklos back from Troy's wall three times: "Thrice clomb Patroklos on the corner of the lofty wall, and thrice did Apollo force him back and smote the shining shield with his immortal hands." On the fourth attempt, Apollo warns him: "Give back, Patroklos of the seed of Zeus! Not beneath thy spear is it fated that the city of the valiant Trojans shall fall, nay nor beneath Achilles, a man far better than thou."[^il16-wall]

Apollo then appears to Hector disguised as Asios (Hekabe's brother), urging him against Patroklos: "turn against Patroklos thy strong-hooved horses, if perchance thou mayst slay him, and Apollo give thee glory."[^il16-asios]

In the final encounter, Apollo attacks Patroklos from behind, hidden in mist: "Phoebus met thee in the strong battle, in dreadful wise... hidden in thick mist did he meet him, and stood behind him, and smote his back and broad shoulders with a down-stroke of his hand, and his eyes were dazed." He then strips Patroklos of all his armour — helmet, spear, shield, and corslet — leaving him defenceless: "the prince Apollo, son of Zeus, loosed his corslet, and blindness seized his heart."[^il16-kills] Patroklos acknowledges this with his dying words: "me have ruinous Fate and the son of Leto slain, and of men Euphorbos, but thou art the third in my slaying."[^il16-dying]

Apollo also bears Sarpedon's body home at [Zeus](zeus.md)'s command, anointing him with ambrosia and sending him "to be wafted by fleet convoy, the twin brethren Sleep and Death."[^il16-sarpedon-body]

[^il16-glaukos]: "Phoebus Apollo heard him. Straightway he made his pains to cease, and in the grievous wound stanched the black blood, and put courage into his heart. And Glaukos knew it within him, and was glad, for that the great god speedily heard his prayer" (Iliad 16.504-508, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il16-wall]: "Thrice clomb Patroklos on the corner of the lofty wall, and thrice did Apollo force him back and smote the shining shield with his immortal hands. But when for the fourth time he came on like a god, then cried far-darting Apollo terribly, and spake winged words: 'Give back, Patroklos of the seed of Zeus! Not beneath thy spear is it fated that the city of the valiant Trojans shall fall, nay nor beneath Achilles, a man far better than thou'" (Iliad 16.637-647)
[^il16-asios]: "Phoebus Apollo stood by him in the guise of a young man and a strong, Asios, who was the mother's brother of horse-taming Hector, being own brother of Hekabe, and son of Dymas, who dwelt in Phrygia... In his guise spake Apollo, son of Zeus, to Hector: 'Hector, wherefore dost thou cease from fight?... turn against Patroklos thy strong-hooved horses, if perchance thou mayst slay him, and Apollo give thee glory'" (Iliad 16.656-668)
[^il16-kills]: "Phoebus met thee in the strong battle, in dreadful wise. And Patroklos was not ware of him coming through the press, for hidden in thick mist did he meet him, and stood behind him, and smote his back and broad shoulders with a down-stroke of his hand, and his eyes were dazed. And from his head Phoebus Apollo smote the helmet... And all the long-shadowed spear was shattered in the hands of Patroklos... while from his shoulders the tasselled shield with the baldric fell to the ground. And the prince Apollo, son of Zeus, loosed his corslet, and blindness seized his heart and his shining limbs were unstrung" (Iliad 16.750-768)
[^il16-dying]: "me have ruinous Fate and the son of Leto slain, and of men Euphorbos, but thou art the third in my slaying" (Iliad 16.829)
[^il16-sarpedon-body]: "He went down the hills of Ida to the dread battle din, and straightway bore goodly Sarpedon out of the darts, and carried him far away and bathed him in the streams of the river, and anointed him with ambrosia, and clad him in garments that wax not old, and sent him to be wafted by fleet convoy, the twin brethren Sleep and Death, that swiftly set him down in the rich land of wide Lykia" (Iliad 16.609-617)

## In the Bibliotheca

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) adds several details to Apollo's mythology not found in the Homeric sources.

### Prophecy from Pan

Apollo "learned the art of prophecy from Pan, the son of Zeus and Hybris."[^apd-pan]

> **VARIANT:** [Homeric Hymn XIX](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) makes [Pan](pan.md) the son of [Hermes](hermes.md) and a daughter of Dryops. The Bibliotheca gives Pan different parentage entirely — son of [Zeus](zeus.md) and Hybris.

### Python and the Oracle at Delphi

Apollo came to Delphi, "where [Themis](themis.md) at that time used to deliver oracles; and when the snake Python, which guarded the oracle, would have hindered him from approaching the chasm, he killed it and took over the oracle."[^apd-python]

> **NEW DETAIL:** The Bibliotheca specifies that [Themis](themis.md) was delivering oracles at Delphi before Apollo, and that Python *guarded* the oracle. In the [Homeric Hymn to Apollo](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) (III), the dragon is female and is slain near the site but is not described as guarding the oracle, and Themis's role is limited to feeding the newborn Apollo.

### Slaying of Tityus

Apollo slew Tityus, "a son of Zeus and Elare, daughter of Orchomenus." Zeus had hidden Elare "under the earth for fear of [Hera](hera.md)," and she bore Tityus there, "of monstrous size." When Tityus assaulted [Leto](leto.md) at Pytho, "she called her children to her aid, and they shot him down with their arrows. And he is punished even after death; for vultures eat his heart in Hades."[^apd-tityus]

### Slaying of Marsyas

Apollo also slew Marsyas, who had found the pipes that [Athena](athena.md) had discarded. In a musical contest, Apollo "turned his lyre upside down in the competition and bade Marsyas do the same. But Marsyas could not, so Apollo was judged the victor and despatched Marsyas by hanging him on a tall pine tree and stripping off his skin."[^apd-marsyas]

### In the Gigantomachy

During the [Gigantomachy](../creatures/giants.md), "Ephialtes was shot by Apollo with an arrow in his left eye and by [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) in his right."[^apd-ephialtes]

[^apd-pan]: "Apollo learned the art of prophecy from Pan, the son of Zeus and Hybris" (Bibliotheca 1.4.1, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-python]: "Themis at that time used to deliver oracles; and when the snake Python, which guarded the oracle, would have hindered him from approaching the chasm, he killed it and took over the oracle." (Bibliotheca 1.4.1, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-tityus]: "he slew also Tityus, who was a son of Zeus and Elare, daughter of Orchomenus; for her, after he had debauched her, Zeus hid under the earth for fear of Hera, and brought forth to the light the son Tityus, of monstrous size, whom she had borne in her womb." (Bibliotheca 1.4.1, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-marsyas]: "Apollo was judged the victor and despatched Marsyas by hanging him on a tall pine tree and stripping off his skin." (Bibliotheca 1.4.2, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-ephialtes]: "Ephialtes was shot by Apollo with an arrow in his left eye and by Hercules in his right" (Bibliotheca 1.6.2, trans. Frazer)

## In the Fabulae

### Aesculapius and the Cyclopes (§49)

The [Fabulae](../sources/hyginus.md) tells how Apollo's son Aesculapius "is said to have restored life either to Glaucus, son of Minos, or to Hippolytus, and Jupiter [[Zeus](zeus.md)] because of this struck him with a thunderbolt."[^hyg-49-aesc] Apollo's response was deadly: "not being able to injure Jupiter, killed the ones who had made the thunderbolt, that is, the Cyclopes."[^hyg-49-cyclopes] The punishment was servitude: "On account of this deed Apollo was given in servitude to Admetus, King in Thessaly."[^hyg-49-admetus]

> **VARIANT:** The Fabulae gives uncertainty about whom Asclepius raised — "either to Glaucus, son of Minos, or to Hippolytus." The Catalogue of Women names no specific mortal.

[^hyg-49-aesc]: "Aesculapius, son of Apollo, is said to have restored life either to Glaucus, son of Minos, or to Hippolytus, and Jupiter because of this struck him with a thunderbolt." (Fabulae §49, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-49-cyclopes]: "Apollo, not being able to injure Jupiter, killed the ones who had made the thunderbolt, that is, the Cyclopes." (Fabulae §49, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-49-admetus]: "On account of this deed Apollo was given in servitude to Admetus, King in Thessaly." (Fabulae §49, trans. Mary Grant)

### Python (§140)

The Fabulae expands the Python story. "Python, offspring of Terra, was a huge dragon who, before the time of Apollo, used to give oracular responses on Mount Parnassus."[^hyg-140-python] [Zeus](zeus.md) lay with Leto, and "[Hera](hera.md) found this out, she decreed (?) that Leto should give birth at a place where the sun did not shine."[^hyg-140-juno] Python pursued Leto "to kill her. But by order of Jove the wind Aquilo carried Latona away, and bore her to Neptune [[Poseidon](poseidon.md)]."[^hyg-140-neptune]

Poseidon "took her to the island Ortygia, and covered the island with waves."[^hyg-140-waves] When Python returned to Parnassus, "Neptune brought the island of Ortygia up to a higher position; it was later called the island of Delos."[^hyg-140-delos]

After his birth, Apollo took vengeance: "Four days after they were born, Apollo exacted vengeance for his mother. For he went to Parnassus and slew Python with his arrows. (Because of this deed he is called Pythian.)"[^hyg-140-vengeance] Apollo established funeral rites: "He put Python's bones in a cauldron, deposited them in his temple, and instituted funeral games for him which are called Pythian."[^hyg-140-games]

[^hyg-140-python]: "Python, offspring of Terra, was a huge dragon who, before the time of Apollo, used to give oracular responses on Mount Parnassus." (Fabulae §140, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-140-juno]: "When Juno found this out, she decreed (?) that Latona should give birth at a place where the sun did not shine." (Fabulae §140, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-140-neptune]: "When Python knew that Latona was pregnant by Jove, he followed her to kill her. But by order of Jove the wind Aquilo carried Latona away, and bore her to Neptune." (Fabulae §140, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-140-waves]: "He protected her, but in order not to make voice Juno's decree, he took her to the island Ortygia, and covered the island with waves." (Fabulae §140, trans. Mary Grant)

### Marsyas (§165)

The Fabulae provides the full story of the musical contest. [Athena](athena.md) (Minerva) "is said to have been the first to make pipes from deer bones and to have come to the banquet of the gods to play."[^hyg-165-pipes] But "[Hera](hera.md) (Juno) and [Aphrodite](aphrodite.md) (Venus) made fun of her because she was grey-eyed and puffed out her cheeks."[^hyg-165-mocked] At a spring in Ida's forest, she "viewed herself in the water, and saw that she was rightly mocked. Because of this she threw away the pipes and vowed that whoever picked them up would be punished severely."[^hyg-165-vow]

Marsyas "found them, and by practicing assiduously kept making sweeter sounds day by day, so that he challenged Apollo to play the lure in a contest with him."[^hyg-165-challenge] The [Muses](muses.md) served as judges. When "Marsyas was departing as victor, when Apollo turned his lyre upside down, and played the same tune — a thing which Marsyas couldn't do with the pipes. And so Apollo defeated Marsyas."[^hyg-165-trick]

The punishment was brutal: "bound him to a tree, and turned him over to a Scythian who stripped his skin off him limb by limb."[^hyg-165-skin] The river took his name: "From his blood the river Marsyas took its name."[^hyg-165-river]

[^hyg-165-pipes]: "Minerva is said to have been the first to make pipes from deer bones and to have come to the banquet of the gods to play." (Fabulae §165, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-165-mocked]: "Juno and Venus made fun of her because she was grey-eyed and puffed out her cheeks, so when mocked in her playing and called ugly she came to the forest of Ida to a spring" (Fabulae §165, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-165-vow]: "as she played she viewed herself in the water, and saw that she was rightly mocked. Because of this she threw away the pipes and vowed that whoever picked them up would be punished severely." (Fabulae §165, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-165-challenge]: "Marsyas, a shepherd, son of Oiagrus, one of the satyrs, found them, and by practicing assiduously kept making sweeter sounds day by day, so that he challenged Apollo to play the lure in a contest with him." (Fabulae §165, trans. Mary Grant)

### Coronis and the Crow (Fragment 89)

The Catalogue gives the earliest version of the Coronis story. A crow brought the news of her infidelity to Apollo at Delphi: "there came a messenger from the sacred feast to goodly Pytho, a crow, and he told unshorn Phoebus of secret deeds, that Ischys son of Elatus had wedded Coronis the daughter of Phlegyas of birth divine."[^cat-coronis]

### Death of Asclepius (Fragment 90)

[Zeus](zeus.md) killed Asclepius for raising the dead: "the father of men and gods was wrath, and from Olympus he smote the son of Leto with a lurid thunderbolt and killed him, arousing the anger of Phoebus."[^cat-asclepius]

### Apollo's Punishment (Fragment 91)

In his rage over Asclepius's death, Apollo would have suffered the ultimate divine punishment: "Apollo would have been cast by Zeus into Tartarus; but Leto interceded for him, and he became bondman to a mortal."[^cat-bondman] This is the Catalogue's version of Apollo's servitude to Admetus.

## In the Bibliotheca (Book 2)

### Gifts to Heracles (2.4.11)

Apollo is one of the gods who armed [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md): "Hercules received a sword from [Hermes](hermes.md), a bow and arrows from Apollo, a golden breastplate from [Hephaestus](hephaestus.md), and a robe from [Athena](athena.md)."[^apd-apo-bow]

### The Cerynitian Hind (2.5.3)

When Heracles caught the Cerynitian hind, "Artemis with Apollo met him, and would have wrested the hind from him, and rebuked him for attempting to kill her sacred animal."[^apd-apo-hind] Heracles appeased them by pleading necessity.

### Pestilence on Troy (2.5.9)

Apollo and [Poseidon](poseidon.md), "desiring to put the wantonness of Laomedon to the proof, assumed the likeness of men and undertook to fortify Pergamum for wages. But when they had fortified it, he would not pay them their wages. Therefore Apollo sent a pestilence, and Poseidon a sea monster."[^apd-apo-troy]

### The Fight over the Tripod (2.6.2)

After Heracles murdered Iphitus and sought purification at Delphi, "the Pythian priestess answered him not by oracles." In frustration, Heracles attempted to plunder the temple and carry off the tripod. "But Apollo fought him, and [Zeus](zeus.md) threw a thunderbolt between them."[^apd-apo-tripod] They were thus parted, and Heracles received an oracle commanding his servitude.

[^apd-apo-bow]: "Hercules received a sword from Hermes, a bow and arrows from Apollo, a golden breastplate from Hephaestus, and a robe from Athena" (Bibliotheca 2.4.11, trans. J.G. Frazer)

[^apd-apo-tripod]: "Apollo fought him, and Zeus threw a thunderbolt between them" (Bibliotheca 2.6.2, trans. J.G. Frazer)

## In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md)

### Python and the Pythian Games (1.438-451)

After the Great Flood, the Earth spontaneously produced new creatures, including the monstrous Python. Apollo destroyed the serpent with a rain of arrows: "The God that bears the bow... destroyed the monster with a myriad darts, and almost emptied all his quiver, till envenomed gore oozed forth from livid wounds."[^met-apo-python] He then instituted the Pythian Games to commemorate the deed. Ovid notes that the laurel did not yet exist, so victors were crowned with oak.

### Daphne (1.452-567)

Apollo's first love arose from Cupid's revenge. After Apollo mocked the love god's bow, Cupid pierced him with a golden arrow of desire while striking the nymph [Daphne](../heroes/daphne.md) with a leaden dart of repulsion. Apollo pursued Daphne in a long chase, listing his divine credentials: "The Delphic Land, the Pataraean Realm, Claros and Tenedos revere my name," and confessing the irony of his plight: "The art of medicine is my invention, and the power of herbs; but though the world declare my useful works there is no herb to medicate my wound."[^met-apo-daphne] When Daphne was transformed into a laurel tree, Apollo claimed it as his sacred tree: "thy green leaves, O Laurel! shall forever crown my brows, be wreathed around my quiver and my lyre."[^met-apo-laurel]

### Marsyas (6.382-400)

The Satyr Marsyas challenged Apollo to a musical contest, pitting his flute against Apollo's lyre. They agreed "the one who lost should be the victor's prey." When Marsyas lost, Apollo flayed him alive. Marsyas cried: "Ah-h-h! why are you now tearing me apart? A flute has not the value of my life!" His body was stripped "till his whole body was a flaming wound, with nerves and veins and viscera exposed."[^met-apo-marsyas] The tears of the mourning Fauns, Satyrs, and Nymphs gathered underground and emerged as the river Marsyas in Phrygia.

### Hyacinthus (10.162-219)

Apollo's love for the Spartan youth Hyacinthus was so consuming that [Delphi](../places/delphi.md) "had no presiding guardian, while the God frequented the Eurotas and the land of Sparta." Apollo abandoned his dignity entirely: "without a thought of dignity, he carried nets and held the dogs in leash."[^met-apo-hyacinthus] During a discus contest, Apollo's throw rebounded from the earth and struck Hyacinthus in the face. Apollo went "deadly pale" and tried healing herbs, but "the wound is past all art of cure." He mourned: "I can see in your sad wound my own guilt, and you are my cause of grief and self-reproach. My own hand gave you death unmerited."[^met-apo-hyacinthus-grief] From the boy's blood sprang a flower inscribed with "AI, AI" — Apollo's cries of grief.

### Coronis and the Raven (2.532-632)

The raven was once white — "their plumage then was white as any dove — white-feathered, snow-white as the geese that guard with watchful cries the Capitol: as white as swans that haunt the streams." The raven discovered that Apollo's beloved Coronis, "fairest maid of all Aemonia," had taken a mortal lover. Despite being warned not to tell, the raven flew to Apollo and reported the infidelity.[^met-apo-raven]

Apollo's reaction was immediate and violent: "he dropped his plectrum and his laurel wreath, and his bright countenance went white with rage. He seized his trusted arms, and having bent his certain bow, pierced with a deadly shaft that bosom which so often he had pressed against his own." Coronis reproached him as she died, and Apollo "moaned in pain" and tried in vain to reverse the wound with healing arts. When the pyre was lit, he "snatched, from the flames of burning and the womb of lifeless mother, the unborn Asclepius, and conveyed him to the cave of Chiron."[^met-apo-coronis]

Apollo punished the raven for bearing the news: "Disgrace reversed the raven's hue from white to black, because offense was given by his chattering tongue."[^met-apo-raven-black]

[^met-apo-raven]: "long ago the ravens were not black — their plumage then was white as any dove — white-feathered, snow-white as the geese that guard with watchful cries the Capitol: as white as swans that haunt the streams" (Metamorphoses 2.535-540, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-apo-coronis]: "he dropped his plectrum and his laurel wreath, and his bright countenance went white with rage. He seized his trusted arms, and having bent his certain bow, pierced with a deadly shaft that bosom which so often he had pressed against his own" (Metamorphoses 2.599-605)
[^met-apo-raven-black]: "Disgrace reversed the raven's hue from white to black, because offense was given by his chattering tongue" (Metamorphoses 2.541-542)

### Contest with Pan, Midas's Ears (11.146-193)

[Pan](pan.md) boasted his music surpassed Apollo's and agreed to a contest judged by the mountain god Tmolus. Pan played his rustic reeds; then Apollo appeared with "golden locks richly wreathed with fresh Parnassian laurel" and a "robe of Tyrian purple" sweeping the ground, playing his gem-studded lyre.[^met-apo-pan] Tmolus judged Apollo the winner. When King Midas alone called the award unjust, Apollo transformed his ears into those of an ass: "drawing them out to a hideous length, he fills them with gray hairs."[^met-apo-midas]

[^met-apo-python]: "The God that bears the bow (a weapon used till then only to hunt the deer and agile goat) destroyed the monster with a myriad darts, and almost emptied all his quiver, till envenomed gore oozed forth from livid wounds" (Metamorphoses 1.438-451, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-apo-daphne]: "The art of medicine is my invention, and the power of herbs; but though the world declare my useful works there is no herb to medicate my wound, and all the arts that save have failed their lord" (Metamorphoses 1.521-524, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-apo-laurel]: "thou shalt be called my chosen tree, and thy green leaves, O Laurel! shall forever crown my brows, be wreathed around my quiver and my lyre" (Metamorphoses 1.557-560, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-apo-marsyas]: "his living skin was ripped off from his limbs, till his whole body was a flaming wound, with nerves and veins and viscera exposed" (Metamorphoses 6.387-389, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-apo-hyacinthus]: "without a thought of dignity, he carried nets and held the dogs in leash, and did not hesitate to go with Hyacinthus on the rough, steep mountain ridges" (Metamorphoses 10.168-172, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-apo-hyacinthus-grief]: "I can see in your sad wound my own guilt, and you are my cause of grief and self-reproach. My own hand gave you death unmerited" (Metamorphoses 10.197-200, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-apo-pan]: "Apollo's golden locks were richly wreathed with fresh Parnassian laurel; his robe of Tyrian purple swept the ground; his left hand held his lyre, adorned with gems and Indian ivory" (Metamorphoses 11.157-164, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-apo-midas]: "The Delian god forbids his stupid ears to hold their native human shape; and, drawing them out to a hideous length, he fills them with gray hairs" (Metamorphoses 11.174-178, trans. Brookes More)

## In [Pindar](../sources/pindar.md)

### Omniscience — Koronis (Pythian III)

Pythian III characterizes Apollo's foreknowledge in sharper terms than any other source. Although absent at Pytho, "the temple's king Loxias was aware" of Koronis's infidelity with Ischys, "for he gave heed to his own wisdom, his mind that knoweth all things; in lies it hath no part, neither in act or thought may god or man deceive him."[^pin-omniscience] This absolute omniscience is presented as a defining attribute. He sent [Artemis](artemis.md) to slay Koronis and, at the last moment, rescued the child [Asclepius](asclepius.md) from her funeral pyre.

### Apollo and Kyrene (Pythian IX)

Pythian IX tells how Apollo discovered Kyrene, daughter of Hypseus (king of the Lapiths), wrestling alone with a lion "without spear" in the mountain dells of Pelion.[^pin-kyrene-lion] Struck by the sight, he summoned [Chiron](../creatures/chiron.md) from his cave and asked: "What man begat her?... Is it lawful openly to put forth my hand to her, or rather on a bridal-bed pluck the sweet flower?"[^pin-kyrene-question]

Chiron laughed and answered obliquely that Apollo already knew, rebuking him for pretending ignorance: "Secret are wise Lovecraft's keys unto love's sanctities, O Phoibos, and among gods and men alike all deem this shame, to have pleasure of marriage at the first openly."[^pin-chiron-reply] Chiron then prophesied that Apollo would carry Kyrene to Libya, where she would found a city and bear a son — whom [Hermes](hermes.md) would carry to the Hours and Earth, who would give him nectar and ambrosia and make him "as an immortal, a Zeus or a holy Apollo, to men beloved of him a very present help, a tutelar of flocks." This son would be called "Agreus and Nomios; but to others Aristaios shall be his name."[^pin-aristaios]

Pindar summarizes the consummation with a striking formula: "swift the act and short the ways of gods who are eager to an end."[^pin-swift]

[^pin-omniscience]: "he gave heed to his own wisdom, his mind that knoweth all things; in lies it hath no part, neither in act or thought may god or man deceive him" (Pindar, Pythian III, trans. Ernest Myers)
[^pin-kyrene-lion]: "Once as she struggled alone, without spear, with a terrible lion, he of the wide quiver, far-darting Apollo, found her" (Pindar, Pythian IX, trans. Ernest Myers)
[^pin-kyrene-question]: "What man begat her? From what tribe was she torn to dwell in the secret places of the shadowing hills?... Is it lawful openly to put forth my hand to her, or rather on a bridal-bed pluck the sweet flower?" (Pindar, Pythian IX, trans. Ernest Myers)
[^pin-chiron-reply]: "Secret are wise Lovecraft's keys unto love's sanctities, O Phoibos, and among gods and men alike all deem this shame, to have pleasure of marriage at the first openly. Now even thee, who mayest have no part in lies, thy soft desire hath led to dissemble in this thy speech" (Pindar, Pythian IX, trans. Ernest Myers)
[^pin-aristaios]: "There shall she bring forth a son, whom glorious Hermes taking up from his mother's arms shall bear to the fair-throned Hours and to Earth: and they shall set the babe upon their knees, and nectar and ambrosia they shall distil upon his lips, and shall make him as an immortal, a Zeus or a holy Apollo, to men beloved of him a very present help, a tutelar of flocks, and to some Agreus and Nomios; but to others Aristaios shall be his name" (Pindar, Pythian IX, trans. Ernest Myers)
[^pin-swift]: "swift the act and short the ways of gods who are eager to an end" (Pindar, Pythian IX, trans. Ernest Myers)

## In Euripides' [Alcestis](../sources/euripides-alcestis.md)

Apollo opens the play, speaking from the house of Admetus about his period of servitude: "O mansions of Admetus, wherein I endured to acquiesce in the slave's table, though a God; for Jove was the cause, by slaying my son Æsculapius, hurling the lightning against his breast: whereat enraged, I slay the Cyclops, forgers of Jove's fire; and me my father compelled to serve for hire with a mortal, as a punishment for these things."[^eur-alc-prologue]

He describes his relationship with Admetus: "being pious I met with a pious man, the son of Pheres, whom I delivered from dying by deluding the Fates."[^eur-alc-fates] The Fates agreed that Admetus could escape death if he found a substitute — only Alcestis was willing.

Apollo confronts Death (Thanatos) directly, who arrives with a sword to claim Alcestis. When Death refuses all persuasion — "It is not: consider that I too am delighted with my due honors" — Apollo prophesies that [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) will take Alcestis by force: "such a man will come to the house of Pheres, whom Eurystheus hath sent after the chariot and its horses, to bring them from the wintry regions of Thrace, who in sooth, being welcomed in the mansions of Admetus, shall take away by force this woman from thee."[^eur-alc-prophecy]

The Chorus later celebrates Apollo's time as a shepherd: "the Pythian Apollo, master of the lyre, deigned to inhabit, and endured to become a shepherd in thine abodes, through the sloping hills piping to thy flocks his pastoral nuptial hymns. And there were wont to feed with them, through delight of his lays, both the spotted lynxes, and the bloody troop of lions... disported too around thy cithern, Phoebus, the dappled fawn."[^eur-alc-shepherd]

[^eur-alc-prologue]: "O mansions of Admetus, wherein I endured to acquiesce in the slave's table, though a God; for Jove was the cause, by slaying my son Æsculapius, hurling the lightning against his breast: whereat enraged, I slay the Cyclops, forgers of Jove's fire; and me my father compelled to serve for hire with a mortal, as a punishment for these things" (Alcestis 1-9, trans. T.A. Buckley)
[^eur-alc-fates]: "being pious I met with a pious man, the son of Pheres, whom I delivered from dying by deluding the Fates: but those Goddesses granted me that Admetus should escape the impending death, could he furnish in his place another dead for the powers below" (Alcestis 10-14)
[^eur-alc-prophecy]: "such a man will come to the house of Pheres, whom Eurystheus hath sent after the chariot and its horses, to bring them from the wintry regions of Thrace, who in sooth, being welcomed in the mansions of Admetus, shall take away by force this woman from thee" (Alcestis 65-69)
[^eur-alc-shepherd]: "the Pythian Apollo, master of the lyre, deigned to inhabit, and endured to become a shepherd in thine abodes, through the sloping hills piping to thy flocks his pastoral nuptial hymns. And there were wont to feed with them, through delight of his lays, both the spotted lynxes, and the bloody troop of lions... disported too around thy cithern, Phoebus, the dappled fawn" (Alcestis 569-580)
