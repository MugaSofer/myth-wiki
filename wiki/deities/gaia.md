## Overview

**Gaia** (Earth) was among the first beings to come into existence, arising after [Chaos](chaos.md). She is described as "wide-bosomed Earth, the ever-sure foundations of all the deathless ones who hold the peaks of snowy [Olympus](../places/olympus.md)."[^theog-gaia] She is both a primordial entity and an active figure in the early divine succession, instigating the overthrow of [Uranus](uranus.md).

[^theog-gaia]: "wide-bosomed Earth, the ever-sure foundations of all the deathless ones who hold the peaks of snowy Olympus" (Theogony 117-118, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Children

### Without Union

Gaia "first bare starry [Heaven](uranus.md), equal to herself, to cover her on every side, and to be an ever-sure abiding-place for the blessed gods."[^theog-heaven] She also brought forth "long Hills, graceful haunts of the goddess-Nymphs who dwell amongst the glens of the hills," and "[Pontus](pontus.md), without sweet union of love" — described as "the fruitless deep with his raging swell."[^theog-pontus]

[^theog-heaven]: "Earth first bare starry Heaven, equal to herself, to cover her on every side, and to be an ever-sure abiding-place for the blessed gods" (Theogony 126-128)
[^theog-pontus]: "She bare also the fruitless deep with his raging swell, Pontus, without sweet union of love" (Theogony 129-132)

### With Uranus (Heaven)

She then "lay with Heaven" and bore:[^theog-titans]

**The Titans:** [Oceanus](oceanus.md), [Coeus](coeus.md), [Crius](crius.md), [Hyperion](hyperion.md), [Iapetus](iapetus.md), [Theia](theia.md), [Rhea](rhea.md), [Themis](themis.md), [Mnemosyne](mnemosyne.md), gold-crowned [Phoebe](phoebe.md), lovely [Tethys](tethys.md), and lastly [Cronos](cronos.md) "the wily, youngest and most terrible of her children."

**The [Cyclopes](../creatures/cyclopes.md):** Brontes, Steropes, and Arges — "in all else they were like the gods, but one eye only was set in the midst of their fore-heads."[^theog-cyclopes]

**The [Hundred-Handers](../creatures/hundred-handers.md):** Cottus, Briareos, and Gyes — "From their shoulders sprang an hundred arms, not to be approached, and each had fifty heads upon his shoulders."[^theog-hh]

[^theog-titans]: "she lay with Heaven and bare deep-swirling Oceanus, Coeus and Crius and Hyperion and Iapetus, Theia and Rhea, Themis and Mnemosyne and gold-crowned Phoebe and lovely Tethys. After them was born Cronos the wily, youngest and most terrible of her children, and he hated his lusty sire." (Theogony 132-138)
[^theog-cyclopes]: "in all else they were like the gods, but one eye only was set in the midst of their fore-heads. And they were surnamed Cyclopes (Orb-eyed) because one orbed eye was set in their foreheads. Strength and might and craft were in their works." (Theogony 142-146)
[^theog-hh]: "From their shoulders sprang an hundred arms, not to be approached, and each had fifty heads upon his shoulders on their strong limbs, and irresistible was the stubborn strength that was in their great forms." (Theogony 147-153)

## Mythology

### The Plot Against Uranus

[Uranus](uranus.md) hid all his children "in a secret place of Earth so soon as each was born, and would not suffer them to come up into the light: and Heaven rejoiced in his evil doing."[^theog-hidden] Gaia, "straitened" and groaning within, "made the element of grey flint and shaped a great sickle, and told her plan to her dear sons," urging them: "My children, gotten of a sinful father, if you will obey me, we should punish the vile outrage of your father."[^theog-plot] Only [Cronos](cronos.md) accepted the task.

[^theog-hidden]: "he used to hide them all away in a secret place of Earth so soon as each was born, and would not suffer them to come up into the light: and Heaven rejoiced in his evil doing" (Theogony 156-159)
[^theog-plot]: "she made the element of grey flint and shaped a great sickle, and told her plan to her dear sons... 'My children, gotten of a sinful father, if you will obey me, we should punish the vile outrage of your father; for he first thought of doing shameful things.'" (Theogony 159-166)
