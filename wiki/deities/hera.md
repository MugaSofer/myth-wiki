## Overview

**Hera** is the queen of the gods and wife of [Zeus](zeus.md). She is a daughter of [Cronos](cronos.md) and [Rhea](rhea.md), and thus one of the Olympians who were swallowed by Cronos and later freed.

[^desc-throne]: "I sing of golden-throned Hera whom Rhea bare. Queen of the immortals is she" (Homeric Hymn XII to Hera 1-2)

## Appearance

**"Surpassing all in beauty"** — the only physical comparison among the gods, from Hymn XII: "Queen of the immortals is she, surpassing all in beauty."[^desc-beauty]

The most detailed divine toilette in the sources appears in [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book XIV, when Hera adorns herself to seduce [Zeus](zeus.md). She anoints with olive oil "ambrosial, soft, and of a sweet savour," combs and plaits "her shining tresses, fair and ambrosial, flowing from her immortal head," dons a robe [Athena](athena.md) wrought for her, clasps of gold, "a girdle arrayed with a hundred tassels," earrings "of three drops, and glistering, therefrom shone grace abundantly," a veil "bright as the sun," and golden sandals.[^il14-adorn] (See [The Deception of Zeus](#the-deception-of-zeus-book-xiv) below for the full episode.)

Hera's physical power is also conveyed through action: she "stirred her upon her throne and made high [Olympus](../places/olympus.md) quake."[^il8-stopped]

[^desc-beauty]: "Queen of the immortals is she, surpassing all in beauty: she is the sister and the wife of loud-thundering Zeus,—the glorious one whom all the blessed throughout high Olympus reverence and honour even as Zeus who delights in thunder" (Homeric Hymn XII to Hera 2-5)

## Children

### With Zeus
"She was joined in love with the king of gods and men, and brought forth Hebe and [Ares](ares.md) and Eileithyia."[^theog-children]

### Without Union
"Hera without union with [Zeus](zeus.md)—for she was very angry and quarrelled with her mate—bare famous Hephaestus, who is skilled in crafts more than all the sons of Heaven."[^theog-hephaestus]

[^theog-children]: "she was joined in love with the king of gods and men, and brought forth Hebe and Ares and Eileithyia" (Theogony 921-923, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^theog-hephaestus]: "Hera without union with Zeus—for she was very angry and quarrelled with her mate—bare famous Hephaestus, who is skilled in crafts more than all the sons of Heaven" (Theogony 927-929)

## Mythology

Hera appears as an active figure in several passages:
- She nourished the Hydra of Lerna, "being angry beyond measure with the mighty [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md)."[^theog-hydra]
- She "brought up and made to haunt the hills of Nemea" the Nemean lion, "a plague to men."[^theog-lion]

[^theog-hydra]: "the goddess, white-armed Hera nourished, being angry beyond measure with the mighty Heracles" (Theogony 314-315)
[^theog-lion]: "Hera, the good wife of Zeus, brought up and made to haunt the hills of Nemea, a plague to men" (Theogony 328-329)

## In the Hymn to Apollo

The [Homeric Hymn to Apollo](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) (III) contains a significant speech by Hera and variant traditions about both [Hephaestus](hephaestus.md) and [Typhoeus](../creatures/typhoeus.md).

### Casting Out Hephaestus

Hera describes [Hephaestus](hephaestus.md) as "weakly among all the blessed gods and shrivelled of foot, a shame and disgrace to me in heaven, whom I myself took in my hands and cast out so that he fell in the great sea. But silver-shod Thetis the daughter of [Nereus](nereus.md) took and cared for him with her sisters."[^hh3-hephaestus]

### Birth of Typhaon

Angered that [Zeus](zeus.md) had birthed [Athena](athena.md) from his head, Hera prayed to Earth and Heaven: "grant that I may bear a child apart from [Zeus](zeus.md), no wit lesser than him in strength." After a full year apart from Zeus, "she bare one neither like the gods nor mortal men, fell, cruel Typhaon, to be a plague to men." She gave him to the she-dragon at Pytho, whom [Apollo](apollo.md) later slew.[^hh3-typhaon]

This represents a **variant tradition** from the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md), where [Typhoeus](../creatures/typhoeus.md) is born of [Gaia](gaia.md) and [Tartarus](../places/tartarus.md).

### Opposing Apollo's Birth

During Leto's labour on Delos, Hera "sat in the halls of cloud-gathering [Zeus](zeus.md)" and kept Eileithyia away "through envy, because Leto with the lovely tresses was soon to bear a son faultless and strong."[^hh3-envy]

[^hh3-hephaestus]: "my son Hephaestus whom I bare was weakly among all the blessed gods and shrivelled of foot, a shame and disgrace to me in heaven, whom I myself took in my hands and cast out so that he fell in the great sea. But silver-shod Thetis the daughter of Nereus took and cared for him with her sisters" (Homeric Hymn III to Apollo 316-321, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^hh3-typhaon]: "she bare one neither like the gods nor mortal men, fell, cruel Typhaon, to be a plague to men. Straightway large-eyed queenly Hera took him and bringing one evil thing to another such, gave him to the dragoness; and she received him" (Homeric Hymn III to Apollo 351-355)
[^hh3-envy]: "Only Eilithyia, goddess of sore travail, had not heard of Leto's trouble, for she sat on the top of Olympus beneath golden clouds by white-armed Hera's contriving, who kept her close through envy" (Homeric Hymn III to Apollo 97-100)

## In the Fabulae

### Ixion and the Cloud (§62)

The [Fabulae](../sources/hyginus.md) tells the story of [Zeus](zeus.md)'s (Jove's) test of Ixion. "Ixion, son of Leonteus, attempted to embrace Juno [[Hera](hera.md)]."[^hyg-62-attempt] Zeus devised a trick: "Juno, by Jove's instructions, substituted a cloud, which Ixion believed to be the likeness of Juno."[^hyg-62-cloud]

The union had consequences: "From this the Centaurs were born."[^hyg-62-centaurs] The punishment was eternal: "But Mercury [[Hermes](hermes.md)], by Jove's instructions, bound Ixion in the Land of the Dead to a wheel, which is said to be still turning there."[^hyg-62-wheel]

[^hyg-62-attempt]: "Ixion, son of Leonteus, attempted to embrace Juno." (Fabulae §62, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-62-cloud]: "Juno, by Jove's instructions, substituted a cloud, which Ixion believed to be the likeness of Juno." (Fabulae §62, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-62-centaurs]: "From this the Centaurs were born." (Fabulae §62, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-62-wheel]: "But Mercury, by Jove's instructions, bound Ixion in the Land of the Dead to a wheel, which is said to be still turning there." (Fabulae §62, trans. Mary Grant)

### Tiresias's Judgment (§75)

The Fabulae preserves the story of Tiresias's sex change and his role as judge in a divine dispute. Tiresias "is said to have struck with his staff, or trampled on, snakes which were coupling" on Mount Cyllene, and "because of this he was changed to a woman."[^hyg-75-woman] Later, "advised by an oracle, he trampled on the snakes in the same place, and returned to his former sex."[^hyg-75-return]

The dispute arose from this unique experience: "At this same time there was a joking dispute between Jove and Juno as to whether man or woman derived more pleasure from the act of love."[^hyg-75-dispute] They took Tiresias as judge "since he had been both man and woman."[^hyg-75-judge]

The verdict had consequences: "When he decided in Jove's favour, Juno with the back of her hand angrily blinded him."[^hyg-75-blind] But Zeus compensated: "Jove because of this gave him seven lives to live, and made him a seer wiser than other mortals."[^hyg-75-seer]

[^hyg-75-woman]: "On Mount Cyllene Tiresias, son of Everes, a shepherd, is said to have struck with his staff, or trampled on, snakes which were coupling. Because of this he was changed to a woman." (Fabulae §75, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-75-return]: "Later, advised by an oracle, he trampled on the snakes in the same place, and returned to his former sex." (Fabulae §75, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-75-dispute]: "At this same time there was a joking dispute between Jove and Juno as to whether man or woman derived more pleasure from the act of love." (Fabulae §75, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-75-judge]: "They took Tiresias as judge, since he had been both man and woman." (Fabulae §75, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-75-blind]: "When he decided in Jove's favour, Juno with the back of her hand angrily blinded him" (Fabulae §75, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-75-seer]: "but Jove because of this gave him seven lives to live, and made him a seer wiser than other mortals." (Fabulae §75, trans. Mary Grant)

## In the Iliad

### Book I

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book I, Hera is called **"the ox-eyed queen"** — a new epithet not found in Hesiod or the Hymns.[^il1-oxeyed] She puts the thought in Achilles' mind to call an assembly, "because she had pity on the Danaans when she beheld them perishing."[^il1-pity] She also sends [Athena](athena.md) to restrain Achilles from killing Agamemnon, "whose heart loved both alike and had care for them."

Later, she confronts [Zeus](zeus.md) about his secret dealings with Thetis: "It is ever thy good pleasure to hold aloof from me and in secret meditation to give thy judgments."[^il1-quarrel] Zeus threatens her, and she is afraid, but smiles when [Hephaestus](hephaestus.md) makes peace. At the close of the day she is **"Hera of the golden throne"** who sleeps beside Zeus.[^il1-throne]

According to Achilles, Hera was one of three gods (with [Poseidon](poseidon.md) and [Athena](athena.md)) who once tried to bind Zeus — until Thetis freed him by summoning Briareus.[^il1-binding]

[^il1-oxeyed]: "Then Hera the ox-eyed queen made answer to him" (Iliad I.551, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il1-pity]: "in his mind did goddess Hera of the white arms put the thought, because she had pity on the Danaans when she beheld them perishing" (Iliad I.55-56)
[^il1-quarrel]: "It is ever thy good pleasure to hold aloof from me and in secret meditation to give thy judgments, nor of thine own good will hast thou ever brought thyself to declare unto me the thing thou purposest" (Iliad I.541-543)
[^il1-throne]: "beside him was Hera of the golden throne" (Iliad I.611)
[^il1-binding]: "all the other Olympians would have bound him, even Hera and Poseidon and Pallas Athene" (Iliad I.399-400)

### Stopping the Retreat (Book II)

When the Greeks rush to flee after Agamemnon's test, Hera intervenes again by sending [Athena](athena.md): "Shall the Argives thus indeed flee homeward to their dear native land over the sea's broad back? But they would leave to Priam and the Trojans their boast, even Helen of Argos, for whose sake many an Achaian hath perished in Troy." She instructs Athena to restrain the army "with thy gentle words."[^il2-retreat]

[^il2-retreat]: "Hera spake a word to Athene: 'Out on it, daughter of aegis-bearing Zeus, unwearied maiden! Shall the Argives thus indeed flee homeward to their dear native land over the sea's broad back? But they would leave to Priam and the Trojans their boast, even Helen of Argos'" (Iliad II.932-936, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

### Thundering for Agamemnon / The Eilithyiai (Book XI)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book XI, Hera and [Athena](athena.md) honour Agamemnon as he arms: "far forth from him into the heaven shone the bronze; and thereat Hera and Athene thundered, honouring the king of Mykene rich in gold."[^il11-thunder]

Later, the Eilithyiai — goddesses of childbirth — are identified as Hera's daughters: Agamemnon's wound-pain is compared to "the piercing shaft that the goddesses of the birth-pangs send, even the Eilithyiai, the daughters of Hera that have bitter pangs in their gift."[^il11-eilithyiai]

[^il11-thunder]: "far forth from him into the heaven shone the bronze; and thereat Hera and Athene thundered, honouring the king of Mykene rich in gold" (Iliad XI.6196-6197, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il11-eilithyiai]: "even as when the keen shaft cometh upon a woman in her travail, the piercing shaft that the goddesses of the birth-pangs send, even the Eilithyiai, the daughters of Hera that have bitter pangs in their gift" (Iliad XI.6411-6413)

### The Deception of Zeus (Book XIV)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book XIV, Hera devises the most elaborate divine scheme in the poem — seducing [Zeus](zeus.md) to sleep so that [Poseidon](poseidon.md) can aid the Greeks openly.

**Adorning herself:** She enters her bower (built by [Hephaestus](hephaestus.md), with secret bolt no other god could open), cleanses herself with ambrosia, anoints with olive oil ("ambrosial, soft, and of a sweet savour; if it were but shaken, in the bronze-floored mansion of Zeus, the savour thereof went right forth to earth and heaven"), combs and plaits her "shining tresses, fair and ambrosial, flowing from her immortal head," dons a "fragrant robe that [Athena](athena.md) wrought delicately for her," clasps of gold, "a girdle arrayed with a hundred tassels," earrings "of three drops, and glistering, therefrom shone grace abundantly," a veil "bright as the sun," and golden sandals.[^il14-adorn]

**Borrowing [Aphrodite](aphrodite.md)'s [girdle](../objects/aphrodites-girdle.md):** Hera asks Aphrodite for "Love and Desire wherewith thou dost overcome all the Immortals, and mortal men," pretending she needs to reconcile Okeanos and Tethys. Aphrodite "from her breast... loosed the broidered girdle, fair-wrought, wherein are all her enchantments; therein are love, and desire, and loving converse, that steals the wits even of the wise."[^il14-girdle]

As her cover story, Hera claims Okeanos and Tethys "reared me well and nourished me in their halls, having taken me from [Rhea](rhea.md), when far-seeing Zeus imprisoned [Kronos](cronos.md) beneath the earth and the unvintaged sea."[^il14-okeanos]

**Recruiting Sleep:** Hera finds "Sleep, the brother of Death" on Lemnos and asks him to lull Zeus. Sleep refuses, recalling a previous time Hera used him: she had sent [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) to Kos with storm winds, and when Zeus woke "he was wrathful, and dashed the gods about his mansion, and me above all he sought, and he would have cast me from the upper air to perish in the deep, if [Night](night.md) had not saved me, Night, that subdues both gods and men... he was in awe of doing aught displeasing to swift Night."[^il14-sleep]

Hera overcomes his reluctance by offering Pasithea, "one of the younger of the [Graces](graces.md)," as his wife. Sleep makes her swear by the inviolable water of [Styx](styx.md), calling "all the gods by name, even those below [Tartaros](../places/tartarus.md) that are called [Titans](titans.md)."[^il14-oath]

**The seduction:** On Ida, Zeus sees Hera and "love came over his deep heart." He lists his past conquests — none moved him as she does now — then wraps them in a golden cloud ("not even the sun might see through it") while "the divine earth sent forth fresh new grass, and dewy lotus, and crocus, and hyacinth, thick and soft."[^il14-earth]

[^il14-adorn]: "With ambrosia first did she cleanse every stain from her winsome body, and anointed her with olive oil, ambrosial, soft, and of a sweet savour; if it were but shaken, in the bronze-floored mansion of Zeus, the savour thereof went right forth to earth and heaven. Therewith she anointed her fair body, and combed her hair, and with her hands plaited her shining tresses, fair and ambrosial, flowing from her immortal head" (Iliad XIV.8371-8377, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il14-girdle]: "from her breast she loosed the broidered girdle, fair-wrought, wherein are all her enchantments; therein are love, and desire, and loving converse, that steals the wits even of the wise" (Iliad XIV.8411-8413)
[^il14-okeanos]: "Okeanos, father of the gods, and mother Tethys, who reared me well and nourished me in their halls, having taken me from Rhea, when far-seeing Zeus imprisoned Kronos beneath the earth and the unvintaged sea" (Iliad XIV.8398-8400)
[^il14-sleep]: "he was wrathful, and dashed the gods about his mansion, and me above all he sought, and he would have cast me from the upper air to perish in the deep, if Night had not saved me, Night, that subdues both gods and men. To her I came as a suppliant in my flight, and he ceased from pursuing, wrathful as he was, for he was in awe of doing aught displeasing to swift Night" (Iliad XIV.8449-8454)
[^il14-oath]: "she sware as he bade her, and called all the gods by name, even those below Tartaros that are called Titans" (Iliad XIV.8473-8474)
[^il14-earth]: "beneath them the divine earth sent forth fresh new grass, and dewy lotus, and crocus, and hyacinth, thick and soft, that raised them aloft from the ground. Therein they lay, and were clad on with a fair golden cloud, whence fell drops of glittering dew" (Iliad XIV.8539-8542)

### Recruiting Poseidon / Stopped by Zeus (Book VIII)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book VIII, when the Trojans drive the Greeks back, Hera tries to recruit [Poseidon](poseidon.md) against [Zeus](zeus.md): "Did we but will, we that are confederate with the Danaans, to drive the Trojans back and withhold far-seeing Zeus, then would he vex himself that he should sit there alone in Ida." Poseidon refuses: "I am not he that would fain see us all at strife with Zeus Kronion, for he verily is mightier far."[^il8-poseidon]

Then Hera and [Athena](athena.md) arm for battle — Hera "stirred her upon her throne and made high Olympus quake" — but Zeus sends [Iris](iris.md) with threats of the thunderbolt, and they turn back. The Hours unyoke their horses.[^il8-stopped]

When Zeus returns and taunts them, Hera pushes back but ultimately yields: "Well know we, even we, that thy might is no wise puny; yet still have we pity for the Danaan spearmen... Yet will we refrain from battle, if thou biddest us."[^il8-yield]

[^il8-poseidon]: "Did we but will, we that are confederate with the Danaans, to drive the Trojans back and withhold far-seeing Zeus, then would he vex himself that he should sit there alone in Ida" ... "I am not he that would fain see us all at strife with Zeus Kronion, for he verily is mightier far" (Iliad VIII.4607-4617, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il8-stopped]: "queen Hera had indignation, and stirred her upon her throne and made high Olympus quake" (Iliad VIII.4605-4606)
[^il8-yield]: "Well know we, even we, that thy might is no wise puny; yet still have we pity for the Danaan spearmen, that now shall perish and fill up the measure of grievous fate. Yet will we refrain from battle, if thou biddest us" (Iliad VIII.4851-4856)

## In the Bibliotheca (Book 2)

### Persecution of Io

When [Zeus](zeus.md) seduced [Io](../heroes/io.md), Hera "requested the cow from Zeus for herself and set Argus the All-seeing to guard it."[^apd-hera-io1] After [Hermes](hermes.md) killed Argus, "Hera next sent a gadfly to infest the cow," driving Io to wander across Europe and Asia.[^apd-hera-io2] When Io bore Epaphus in Egypt, "Hera besought the Curetes to make away with" the child.[^apd-hera-io3]

### The Mad Daughters of Proetus

The daughters of Proetus went mad — "according to Hesiod, because they would not accept the rites of [Dionysus](dionysus.md), but according to Acusilaus, because they disparaged the wooden image of Hera."[^apd-hera-proetids]

### Persecution of Heracles

Hera's enmity towards [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) ran from before his birth to his death:

- **Birth interference:** "Out of jealousy persuaded the Ilithyias to retard Alcmena's delivery, and contrived that Eurystheus, son of Sthenelus, should be born a seven-month child."[^apd-hera-birth]
- **Serpent attack:** "When the child was eight months old, Hera desired the destruction of the babe and sent two huge serpents to the bed."[^apd-hera-serpents]
- **Madness:** Heracles "was driven mad through the jealousy of Hera and flung his own children... into the fire."[^apd-hera-madness]
- **Amazon deception:** "Hera in the likeness of an Amazon went up and down the multitude saying that the strangers who had arrived were carrying off the queen," provoking the Amazons to attack Heracles and causing Hippolyte's death.[^apd-hera-amazon]
- **Gadfly on Geryon's cattle:** During the return from Erythia, "Hera afflicted the cows with a gadfly, and they dispersed among the skirts of the mountains of Thrace."[^apd-hera-gadfly]
- **Storms after Troy:** "Hera sent grievous storms" against Heracles sailing from Troy, "which so vexed Zeus that he hung her from Olympus."[^apd-hera-storms]

### Reconciliation

After Heracles' apotheosis, Hera was reconciled to him: "being reconciled to Hera he married her daughter [Hebe](hebe.md)."[^apd-hera-reconciled]

[^apd-hera-io1]: "Hera requested the cow from Zeus for herself and set Argus the All-seeing to guard it" (Bibliotheca 2.1.3, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-hera-io2]: "Hera next sent a gadfly to infest the cow, and the animal came first to what is called after her the Ionian gulf" (Bibliotheca 2.1.3)
[^apd-hera-io3]: "Him Hera besought the Curetes to make away with, and make away with him they did" (Bibliotheca 2.1.3)
[^apd-hera-proetids]: "they went mad, according to Hesiod, because they would not accept the rites of Dionysus, but according to Acusilaus, because they disparaged the wooden image of Hera" (Bibliotheca 2.2.2)
[^apd-hera-birth]: "Hera out of jealousy persuaded the Ilithyias to retard Alcmena's delivery, and contrived that Eurystheus, son of Sthenelus, should be born a seven-month child" (Bibliotheca 2.4.5)
[^apd-hera-serpents]: "When the child was eight months old, Hera desired the destruction of the babe and sent two huge serpents to the bed" (Bibliotheca 2.4.8)
[^apd-hera-madness]: "after the battle with the Minyans Hercules was driven mad through the jealousy of Hera and flung his own children, whom he had by Megara, and two children of Iphicles into the fire" (Bibliotheca 2.4.12)
[^apd-hera-amazon]: "Hera in the likeness of an Amazon went up and down the multitude saying that the strangers who had arrived were carrying off the queen" (Bibliotheca 2.5.9)
[^apd-hera-gadfly]: "Hera afflicted the cows with a gadfly, and they dispersed among the skirts of the mountains of Thrace" (Bibliotheca 2.5.10)
[^apd-hera-storms]: "When Hercules was sailing from Troy, Hera sent grievous storms, which so vexed Zeus that he hung her from Olympus" (Bibliotheca 2.7.1)
[^apd-hera-reconciled]: "being reconciled to Hera he married her daughter Hebe, by whom he had sons, Alexiares and Anicetus" (Bibliotheca 2.7.7)

## In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md)

### Io's Persecution (1.601-746)

Hera (Juno) detected [Zeus](zeus.md)'s affair with [Io](../heroes/io.md) by noticing suspicious clouds in bright daylight: "This cloud deceives my mind, or Jove has wronged me."[^met-hera-io1] When Zeus transformed Io into a white heifer, Hera shrewdly asked for the cow as a gift — trapping Zeus, since refusal would prove guilt. She then set Argus (with "a hundred glowing eyes") to guard Io.[^met-hera-io2] After [Hermes](hermes.md) slew Argus, Hera "spread their glister on the feathers of her bird, emblazoning its tail with starry gems" — an aetiology for the peacock's tail.[^met-hera-peacock] She then drove Io with "a dreadful Fury" and "Stings invisible" through the world until Zeus swore on the Styx to stop.

### The Trick on Semele (3.253-315)

Hera disguised herself as the old nurse Beroe to convince Semele to demand Zeus appear in his true divine form. Her jealous soliloquy is vivid: "Am I not Juno the supreme of Heaven? Queen of the flashing scepter?"[^met-hera-semele] The trick succeeded — Semele was burned to ashes by Zeus's thunder.

### Tiresias's Judgment (3.316-338)

When Tiresias sided with Zeus in the dispute about sexual pleasure, Hera "enraged, decreed eternal night should seal Tiresias' eyes." Ovid notes that "immortal Deities may never turn decrees and deeds of other Gods to naught" — even Zeus could not undo her punishment, only compensate with prophecy.

### Heracles' Death (9.134-272)

Though Hera's hatred of [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) drove the plot, Ovid has Heracles address her directly as he dies: "Come Juno, feast upon my death; feast on me, cruel one, look down from your exalted seat; behold my dreadful end and glut your savage heart!"[^met-hera-heracles] When Zeus announced Heracles' apotheosis, "Juno seemed to be contented and to acquiesce, her deep vexation was not wholly hid."

[^met-hera-io1]: "This cloud deceives my mind, or Jove has wronged me" (Metamorphoses 1.606-607, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-hera-io2]: "Juno regardful of Jove's cunning art... gave the unhappy heifer to the charge of Argus, Aristorides, whose head was circled with a hundred glowing eyes" (Metamorphoses 1.622-625, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-hera-peacock]: "Saturn's daughter spread their glister on the feathers of her bird, emblazoning its tail with starry gems" (Metamorphoses 1.722-723, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-hera-semele]: "Am I not Juno the supreme of Heaven? Queen of the flashing scepter? Am I not sister and wife of Jove omnipotent?" (Metamorphoses 3.265-268, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-hera-heracles]: "Come Juno, feast upon my death; feast on me, cruel one, look down from your exalted seat; behold my dreadful end and glut your savage heart!" (Metamorphoses 9.176-180, trans. Brookes More)

## In the [Aeneid](../sources/aeneid.md)

Juno is the primary divine antagonist of the *Aeneid*, opposing [Aeneas](../heroes/aeneas.md) from start to finish. Her motives are stated at the outset: the judgment of Paris, Ganymede's elevation, and her love for Carthage, destined to be destroyed by Rome.

### Summoning Allecto (7.286-571)

When Juno sees the Trojans settled in Italy, she delivers a bitter soliloquy acknowledging her repeated failures: "Against the Teucrians the forces of sky and sea are spent. What hath availed me Syrtes or Scylla, what desolate Charybdis?... But I, Jove's imperial consort, who have borne, ah me! to leave naught undared, who have shifted to every device, I am vanquished by Aeneas."[^aen-hera-soliloquy] She resolves: "If the powers of heaven are inflexible, I will stir up Acheron."[^aen-hera-acheron]

She descends and calls "dolorous Allecto from the home of the Fatal Sisters in nether gloom, whose delight is in woeful wars, in wrath and treachery and evil feuds: hateful to lord Pluto himself, hateful and horrible to her hell-born sisters; into so many faces does she turn, so savage the guise of each, so thick and black bristles she with vipers."[^aen-hera-allecto] She commands Allecto to shatter the peace, "sunder the peace they have joined, and sow seeds of quarrel."[^aen-hera-command]

Allecto obeys in three stages: she flings a serpent into Queen Amata's breast, driving her to Bacchic frenzy; she appears to Turnus disguised as the priestess Calybe, then reveals herself as a Fury ("I am come from the home of the Dread Sisters: war and death are in my hand"); and she drives Iülus's hounds to wound a sacred stag, sparking the first bloodshed.

When Allecto returns to boast, Juno dismisses her: "Terror and harm is wrought abundantly... Our Lord who reigns on Olympus' summit would not have thee stray too freely in heaven's upper air. Withdraw thy presence. Whatsoever future remains in the struggle, that I myself will sway."[^aen-hera-dismiss]

### The Reconciliation (12.791-842)

In the poem's climactic divine scene, Juno yields to [Jupiter](../deities/zeus.md) — but extracts a remarkable concession. She first confesses: "I counselled Juturna, I confess it, to succour her hapless brother, and for his life's sake favoured a greater daring; yet not the arrow-shot, not the bending of the bow, I swear by the merciless well-head of the Stygian spring."[^aen-hera-confess]

She then asks that when the Trojans and Latins unite, the Latin people keep their name, their language, and their identity: "bid thou not the native Latins change their name of old, nor become Trojans and take the Teucrian name, or change their language, or alter their attire: let Latium be, let Alban kings endure through ages, let Italian valour be potent in the race of Rome. Troy is fallen; let her and her name lie where they fell."[^aen-hera-terms]

Jupiter agrees, smiling: "Jove's own sister thou art, and second seed of Saturn, such surge of wrath tosses within thy breast! But come, allay this madness so vainly stirred. I give thee thy will, and yield thee ungrudged victory. Ausonia shall keep her native speech and usage, and as her name is, it shall be. The Trojans shall sink mingling into their blood."[^aen-hera-concession] He promises a mixed race that "shall outdo men and gods in duty; nor shall any nation so observe thy worship." Juno assented "and in gladness withdrew her purpose."

[^aen-hera-soliloquy]: "Against the Teucrians the forces of sky and sea are spent. What hath availed me Syrtes or Scylla, what desolate Charybdis? they find shelter in their desired Tiber-bed, careless of ocean and of me... But I, Jove's imperial consort, who have borne, ah me! to leave naught undared, who have shifted to every device, I am vanquished by Aeneas" (Aeneid 7.302-310, trans. J.W. Mackail)
[^aen-hera-acheron]: "If the powers of heaven are inflexible, I will stir up Acheron" (Aeneid 7.312)
[^aen-hera-allecto]: "calls dolorous Allecto from the home of the Fatal Sisters in nether gloom, whose delight is in woeful wars, in wrath and treachery and evil feuds: hateful to lord Pluto himself, hateful and horrible to her hell-born sisters; into so many faces does she turn, so savage the guise of each, so thick and black bristles she with vipers" (Aeneid 7.323-329)
[^aen-hera-command]: "Sunder the peace they have joined, and sow seeds of quarrel; let all at once desire and demand and seize on arms" (Aeneid 7.339-340)
[^aen-hera-dismiss]: "Terror and harm is wrought abundantly... Our Lord who reigns on Olympus' summit would not have thee stray too freely in heaven's upper air. Withdraw thy presence. Whatsoever future remains in the struggle, that I myself will sway" (Aeneid 7.552-560)
[^aen-hera-confess]: "I counselled Juturna, I confess it, to succour her hapless brother, and for his life's sake favoured a greater daring; yet not the arrow-shot, not the bending of the bow, I swear by the merciless well-head of the Stygian spring, the single ordained dread of the gods in heaven" (Aeneid 12.813-816)
[^aen-hera-terms]: "bid thou not the native Latins change their name of old, nor become Trojans and take the Teucrian name, or change their language, or alter their attire: let Latium be, let Alban kings endure through ages, let Italian valour be potent in the race of Rome. Troy is fallen; let her and her name lie where they fell" (Aeneid 12.823-828)
[^aen-hera-concession]: "I give thee thy will, and yield thee ungrudged victory. Ausonia shall keep her native speech and usage, and as her name is, it shall be. The Trojans shall sink mingling into their blood; I will add their sacred law and ritual, and make all Latins and of a single speech. Hence shall spring a race of tempered Ausonian blood, whom thou shalt see outdo men and gods in duty; nor shall any nation so observe thy worship" (Aeneid 12.833-840)
