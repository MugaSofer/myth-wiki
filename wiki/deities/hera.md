## Overview

## Mythology

Hera appears as an active figure in several passages:

- She "brought up and made to haunt the hills of Nemea" the Nemean lion, "a plague to men."[^theog-lion]

## In the Hymn to Apollo

The [Homeric Hymn to Apollo](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) (III) contains a significant speech by Hera and variant traditions about both [Hephaestus](hephaestus.md) and [Typhoeus](../creatures/typhoeus.md).

### Casting Out Hephaestus

Hera describes [Hephaestus](hephaestus.md) as "weakly among all the blessed gods and shrivelled of foot, a shame and disgrace to me in heaven, whom I myself took in my hands and cast out so that he fell in the great sea. But silver-shod Thetis the daughter of [Nereus](nereus.md) took and cared for him with her sisters."[^hh3-hephaestus]

### Birth of Typhaon

Angered that [Zeus](zeus.md) had birthed [Athena](athena.md) from his head, Hera prayed to Earth and Heaven: "grant that I may bear a child apart from [Zeus](zeus.md), no wit lesser than him in strength." After a full year apart from Zeus, "she bare one neither like the gods nor mortal men, fell, cruel Typhaon, to be a plague to men." She gave him to the she-dragon at Pytho, whom [Apollo](apollo.md) later slew.[^hh3-typhaon]

This represents a **variant tradition** from the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md), where [Typhoeus](../creatures/typhoeus.md) is born of [Gaia](gaia.md) and [Tartarus](../places/tartarus.md).

### Opposing Apollo's Birth

During Leto's labour on Delos, Hera "sat in the halls of cloud-gathering [Zeus](zeus.md)" and kept Eileithyia away "through envy, because Leto with the lovely tresses was soon to bear a son faultless and strong."[^hh3-envy]

[^hh3-hephaestus]: "my son Hephaestus whom I bare was weakly among all the blessed gods and shrivelled of foot, a shame and disgrace to me in heaven, whom I myself took in my hands and cast out so that he fell in the great sea. But silver-shod Thetis the daughter of Nereus took and cared for him with her sisters" (Homeric Hymn III to Apollo 316-321, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^hh3-typhaon]: "she bare one neither like the gods nor mortal men, fell, cruel Typhaon, to be a plague to men. Straightway large-eyed queenly Hera took him and bringing one evil thing to another such, gave him to the dragoness; and she received him" (Homeric Hymn III to Apollo 351-355)
[^hh3-envy]: "Only Eilithyia, goddess of sore travail, had not heard of Leto's trouble, for she sat on the top of Olympus beneath golden clouds by white-armed Hera's contriving, who kept her close through envy" (Homeric Hymn III to Apollo 97-100)
