## Overview

[^theog-hephaestus]: "Hera without union with Zeus—for she was very angry and quarrelled with her mate—bare famous Hephaestus, who is skilled in crafts more than all the sons of Heaven" (Theogony 927-929)

## Mythology

Hera appears as an active figure in several passages:
- She nourished the Hydra of Lerna, "being angry beyond measure with the mighty [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md)."[^theog-hydra]
- She "brought up and made to haunt the hills of Nemea" the Nemean lion, "a plague to men."[^theog-lion]

[^theog-hydra]: "the goddess, white-armed Hera nourished, being angry beyond measure with the mighty Heracles" (Theogony 314-315)
[^theog-lion]: "Hera, the good wife of Zeus, brought up and made to haunt the hills of Nemea, a plague to men" (Theogony 328-329)

## In the Hymn to Apollo

The [Homeric Hymn to Apollo](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) (III) contains a significant speech by Hera and variant traditions about both [Hephaestus](hephaestus.md) and [Typhoeus](../creatures/typhoeus.md).

### Casting Out Hephaestus

Hera describes [Hephaestus](hephaestus.md) as "weakly among all the blessed gods and shrivelled of foot, a shame and disgrace to me in heaven, whom I myself took in my hands and cast out so that he fell in the great sea. But silver-shod Thetis the daughter of [Nereus](nereus.md) took and cared for him with her sisters."[^hh3-hephaestus]

### Birth of Typhaon

Angered that [Zeus](zeus.md) had birthed [Athena](athena.md) from his head, Hera prayed to Earth and Heaven: "grant that I may bear a child apart from [Zeus](zeus.md), no wit lesser than him in strength." After a full year apart from Zeus, "she bare one neither like the gods nor mortal men, fell, cruel Typhaon, to be a plague to men." She gave him to the she-dragon at Pytho, whom [Apollo](apollo.md) later slew.[^hh3-typhaon]

This represents a **variant tradition** from the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md), where [Typhoeus](../creatures/typhoeus.md) is born of [Gaia](gaia.md) and [Tartarus](../places/tartarus.md).

### Opposing Apollo's Birth

During Leto's labour on Delos, Hera "sat in the halls of cloud-gathering [Zeus](zeus.md)" and kept Eileithyia away "through envy, because Leto with the lovely tresses was soon to bear a son faultless and strong."[^hh3-envy]

[^hh3-hephaestus]: "my son Hephaestus whom I bare was weakly among all the blessed gods and shrivelled of foot, a shame and disgrace to me in heaven, whom I myself took in my hands and cast out so that he fell in the great sea. But silver-shod Thetis the daughter of Nereus took and cared for him with her sisters" (Homeric Hymn III to Apollo 316-321, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^hh3-typhaon]: "she bare one neither like the gods nor mortal men, fell, cruel Typhaon, to be a plague to men. Straightway large-eyed queenly Hera took him and bringing one evil thing to another such, gave him to the dragoness; and she received him" (Homeric Hymn III to Apollo 351-355)
[^hh3-envy]: "Only Eilithyia, goddess of sore travail, had not heard of Leto's trouble, for she sat on the top of Olympus beneath golden clouds by white-armed Hera's contriving, who kept her close through envy" (Homeric Hymn III to Apollo 97-100)

## In the Iliad

### Book I

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book I, Hera is called **"the ox-eyed queen"** — a new epithet not found in Hesiod or the Hymns.[^il1-oxeyed] She puts the thought in Achilles' mind to call an assembly, "because she had pity on the Danaans when she beheld them perishing."[^il1-pity] She also sends [Athena](athena.md) to restrain Achilles from killing Agamemnon, "whose heart loved both alike and had care for them."

Later, she confronts [Zeus](zeus.md) about his secret dealings with Thetis: "It is ever thy good pleasure to hold aloof from me and in secret meditation to give thy judgments."[^il1-quarrel] Zeus threatens her, and she is afraid, but smiles when [Hephaestus](hephaestus.md) makes peace. At the close of the day she is **"Hera of the golden throne"** who sleeps beside Zeus.[^il1-throne]

According to Achilles, Hera was one of three gods (with [Poseidon](poseidon.md) and [Athena](athena.md)) who once tried to bind Zeus — until Thetis freed him by summoning Briareus.[^il1-binding]

[^il1-oxeyed]: "Then Hera the ox-eyed queen made answer to him" (Iliad I.551, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il1-pity]: "in his mind did goddess Hera of the white arms put the thought, because she had pity on the Danaans when she beheld them perishing" (Iliad I.55-56)
[^il1-quarrel]: "It is ever thy good pleasure to hold aloof from me and in secret meditation to give thy judgments, nor of thine own good will hast thou ever brought thyself to declare unto me the thing thou purposest" (Iliad I.541-543)
[^il1-throne]: "beside him was Hera of the golden throne" (Iliad I.611)
[^il1-binding]: "all the other Olympians would have bound him, even Hera and Poseidon and Pallas Athene" (Iliad I.399-400)

### Stopping the Retreat (Book II)

When the Greeks rush to flee after Agamemnon's test, Hera intervenes again by sending [Athena](athena.md): "Shall the Argives thus indeed flee homeward to their dear native land over the sea's broad back? But they would leave to Priam and the Trojans their boast, even Helen of Argos, for whose sake many an Achaian hath perished in Troy." She instructs Athena to restrain the army "with thy gentle words."[^il2-retreat]

[^il2-retreat]: "Hera spake a word to Athene: 'Out on it, daughter of aegis-bearing Zeus, unwearied maiden! Shall the Argives thus indeed flee homeward to their dear native land over the sea's broad back? But they would leave to Priam and the Trojans their boast, even Helen of Argos'" (Iliad II.932-936, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

### Thundering for Agamemnon / The Eilithyiai (Book XI)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book XI, Hera and [Athena](athena.md) honour Agamemnon as he arms: "far forth from him into the heaven shone the bronze; and thereat Hera and Athene thundered, honouring the king of Mykene rich in gold."[^il11-thunder]

Later, the Eilithyiai — goddesses of childbirth — are identified as Hera's daughters: Agamemnon's wound-pain is compared to "the piercing shaft that the goddesses of the birth-pangs send, even the Eilithyiai, the daughters of Hera that have bitter pangs in their gift."[^il11-eilithyiai]

[^il11-thunder]: "far forth from him into the heaven shone the bronze; and thereat Hera and Athene thundered, honouring the king of Mykene rich in gold" (Iliad XI.6196-6197, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il11-eilithyiai]: "even as when the keen shaft cometh upon a woman in her travail, the piercing shaft that the goddesses of the birth-pangs send, even the Eilithyiai, the daughters of Hera that have bitter pangs in their gift" (Iliad XI.6411-6413)

### The Deception of Zeus (Book XIV)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book XIV, Hera devises the most elaborate divine scheme in the poem — seducing [Zeus](zeus.md) to sleep so that [Poseidon](poseidon.md) can aid the Greeks openly.

**Adorning herself:** She enters her bower (built by [Hephaestus](hephaestus.md), with secret bolt no other god could open), cleanses herself with ambrosia, anoints with olive oil ("ambrosial, soft, and of a sweet savour; if it were but shaken, in the bronze-floored mansion of Zeus, the savour thereof went right forth to earth and heaven"), combs and plaits her "shining tresses, fair and ambrosial, flowing from her immortal head," dons a "fragrant robe that [Athena](athena.md) wrought delicately for her," clasps of gold, "a girdle arrayed with a hundred tassels," earrings "of three drops, and glistering, therefrom shone grace abundantly," a veil "bright as the sun," and golden sandals.[^il14-adorn]

**Borrowing [Aphrodite](aphrodite.md)'s girdle:** Hera asks Aphrodite for "Love and Desire wherewith thou dost overcome all the Immortals, and mortal men," pretending she needs to reconcile Okeanos and Tethys. Aphrodite "from her breast... loosed the broidered girdle, fair-wrought, wherein are all her enchantments; therein are love, and desire, and loving converse, that steals the wits even of the wise."[^il14-girdle]

As her cover story, Hera claims Okeanos and Tethys "reared me well and nourished me in their halls, having taken me from [Rhea](rhea.md), when far-seeing Zeus imprisoned [Kronos](cronos.md) beneath the earth and the unvintaged sea."[^il14-okeanos]

**Recruiting Sleep:** Hera finds "Sleep, the brother of Death" on Lemnos and asks him to lull Zeus. Sleep refuses, recalling a previous time Hera used him: she had sent [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) to Kos with storm winds, and when Zeus woke "he was wrathful, and dashed the gods about his mansion, and me above all he sought, and he would have cast me from the upper air to perish in the deep, if [Night](night.md) had not saved me, Night, that subdues both gods and men... he was in awe of doing aught displeasing to swift Night."[^il14-sleep]

Hera overcomes his reluctance by offering Pasithea, "one of the younger of the [Graces](graces.md)," as his wife. Sleep makes her swear by the inviolable water of [Styx](styx.md), calling "all the gods by name, even those below [Tartaros](../places/tartarus.md) that are called [Titans](titans.md)."[^il14-oath]

**The seduction:** On Ida, Zeus sees Hera and "love came over his deep heart." He lists his past conquests — none moved him as she does now — then wraps them in a golden cloud ("not even the sun might see through it") while "the divine earth sent forth fresh new grass, and dewy lotus, and crocus, and hyacinth, thick and soft."[^il14-earth]

[^il14-adorn]: "With ambrosia first did she cleanse every stain from her winsome body, and anointed her with olive oil, ambrosial, soft, and of a sweet savour; if it were but shaken, in the bronze-floored mansion of Zeus, the savour thereof went right forth to earth and heaven. Therewith she anointed her fair body, and combed her hair, and with her hands plaited her shining tresses, fair and ambrosial, flowing from her immortal head" (Iliad XIV.8371-8377, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il14-girdle]: "from her breast she loosed the broidered girdle, fair-wrought, wherein are all her enchantments; therein are love, and desire, and loving converse, that steals the wits even of the wise" (Iliad XIV.8411-8413)
[^il14-okeanos]: "Okeanos, father of the gods, and mother Tethys, who reared me well and nourished me in their halls, having taken me from Rhea, when far-seeing Zeus imprisoned Kronos beneath the earth and the unvintaged sea" (Iliad XIV.8398-8400)
[^il14-sleep]: "he was wrathful, and dashed the gods about his mansion, and me above all he sought, and he would have cast me from the upper air to perish in the deep, if Night had not saved me, Night, that subdues both gods and men. To her I came as a suppliant in my flight, and he ceased from pursuing, wrathful as he was, for he was in awe of doing aught displeasing to swift Night" (Iliad XIV.8449-8454)
[^il14-oath]: "she sware as he bade her, and called all the gods by name, even those below Tartaros that are called Titans" (Iliad XIV.8473-8474)
[^il14-earth]: "beneath them the divine earth sent forth fresh new grass, and dewy lotus, and crocus, and hyacinth, thick and soft, that raised them aloft from the ground. Therein they lay, and were clad on with a fair golden cloud, whence fell drops of glittering dew" (Iliad XIV.8539-8542)

### Recruiting Poseidon / Stopped by Zeus (Book VIII)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book VIII, when the Trojans drive the Greeks back, Hera tries to recruit [Poseidon](poseidon.md) against [Zeus](zeus.md): "Did we but will, we that are confederate with the Danaans, to drive the Trojans back and withhold far-seeing Zeus, then would he vex himself that he should sit there alone in Ida." Poseidon refuses: "I am not he that would fain see us all at strife with Zeus Kronion, for he verily is mightier far."[^il8-poseidon]

Then Hera and [Athena](athena.md) arm for battle — Hera "stirred her upon her throne and made high Olympus quake" — but Zeus sends [Iris](iris.md) with threats of the thunderbolt, and they turn back. The Hours unyoke their horses.[^il8-stopped]

When Zeus returns and taunts them, Hera pushes back but ultimately yields: "Well know we, even we, that thy might is no wise puny; yet still have we pity for the Danaan spearmen... Yet will we refrain from battle, if thou biddest us."[^il8-yield]

[^il8-poseidon]: "Did we but will, we that are confederate with the Danaans, to drive the Trojans back and withhold far-seeing Zeus, then would he vex himself that he should sit there alone in Ida" ... "I am not he that would fain see us all at strife with Zeus Kronion, for he verily is mightier far" (Iliad VIII.4607-4617, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il8-stopped]: "queen Hera had indignation, and stirred her upon her throne and made high Olympus quake" (Iliad VIII.4605-4606)
[^il8-yield]: "Well know we, even we, that thy might is no wise puny; yet still have we pity for the Danaan spearmen, that now shall perish and fill up the measure of grievous fate. Yet will we refrain from battle, if thou biddest us" (Iliad VIII.4851-4856)
