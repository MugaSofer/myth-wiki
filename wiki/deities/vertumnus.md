## Overview

**Vertumnus** was a Latin god with "a natural gift of grace, so that he can most readily transform himself to any wanted shape."[^met-vert-gift] He is best known for his persistent courtship of the wood-nymph [Pomona](../heroes/pomona.md), whom he wooed in a succession of disguises before winning her love with his true divine form.

## Powers

Vertumnus possessed extraordinary shape-shifting abilities. He could become "whatever you may wish — even though you ask him things unseen before."[^met-vert-gift] In his pursuit of Pomona, he appeared as a rough reaper, a haymaker, an ox-driver, a tree-pruner, a fruit-picker, a soldier, a fisherman, and an old woman.[^met-vert-shapes]

### Courtship of Pomona (14.642-771)

Vertumnus "did exceed them in his love" for [Pomona](../heroes/pomona.md), but "was not more fortunate" than the satyrs, Pans, and other suitors she rejected.[^met-vert-love] Through his many disguises "he often had obtained access to her and joyed in seeing her beauty."[^met-vert-access]

His final stratagem was to appear as an old woman. He entered Pomona's walled garden, praised her beauty with kisses "such as no real beldame ever gave," and used the parable of the elm and vine to argue for marriage.[^met-vert-elm] He warned her of divine retribution for cruelty and told the tale of Iphis and Anaxarete as a cautionary example.

Speaking as the old woman, he advocated for himself: "He is not better known even to himself, than he is known to me. And he is not now wandering everywhere, from here to there throughout the world. He always will frequent the places near here." He declared that Pomona was Vertumnus's "first and last love, and to you alone will he devote his life."[^met-vert-plea]

When persuasion failed, "he laid the old woman's form aside and was again a youth. On her he seemed to blaze, as when the full light of the brilliant Sun, after it has dispelled opposing clouds, has shone forth with not one to intercept."[^met-vert-reveal] He prepared to use force, but "there was then no need of force. The lovely nymph was charmed, was captivated by the god's bright form and felt a passion answering to his love."[^met-vert-love-won]
