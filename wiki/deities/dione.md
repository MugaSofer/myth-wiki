|---|---|
| **Role** | Mother of [Aphrodite](aphrodite.md) (Iliad tradition) |

| **First appearance** | [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) V |

## Overview

**Dione** appears in [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book V as [Aphrodite](aphrodite.md)'s mother, representing a variant tradition from the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md)'s account of Aphrodite's birth from [Uranus](uranus.md)'s severed members. In this tradition, Aphrodite is the daughter of [Zeus](zeus.md) and Dione.

## Mother of Aphrodite (Iliad V)

When [Aphrodite](aphrodite.md) is wounded by Diomedes while shielding Aeneas, she flees to [Olympus](../places/olympus.md) and "fair Aphrodite fell upon Dione's knees that was her mother. She took her daughter in her arms and stroked her with her hand."[^il5-dione]

[^il5-dione]: "fair Aphrodite fell upon Dione's knees that was her mother. She took her daughter in her arms and stroked her with her hand" (Iliad V.2948-2949, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

## Tales of Gods Wounded by Mortals

Dione comforts Aphrodite by telling tales of gods who have suffered at the hands of mortals, emphasizing that such indignities are not unique:

### Ares Bound by Otos and Ephialtes

"So suffered [Ares](ares.md), when Otos and stalwart Ephialtes, sons of Aloeus, bound him in a strong prison-house; yea in a vessel of bronze lay he bound thirteen months. Then might Ares insatiate of battle have perished, but that the step-mother of Aloeus' sons, fair Eëriboia, gave tidings to [Hermes](hermes.md), and he stole away Ares, already pining; for the grievous prison-house was wearing him out."[^il5-ares]

### Hera Wounded by Heracles

[Hera](hera.md) was wounded by [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) with "a three-barbed arrow."[^il5-hera]

### Hades Wounded by Heracles at Pylos

[Hades](hades.md) was wounded by [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) "in Pylos amid the dead" with a swift arrow in the shoulder and was healed by Paieon.[^il5-hades]

[^il5-ares]: "So suffered Ares, when Otos and stalwart Ephialtes, sons of Aloeus, bound him in a strong prison-house; yea in a vessel of bronze lay he bound thirteen months. Then might Ares insatiate of battle have perished, but that the step-mother of Aloeus' sons, fair Eëriboia, gave tidings to Hermes, and he stole away Ares, already pining; for the grievous prison-house was wearing him out" (Iliad V.2963-2968, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il5-hera]: Heracles wounded Hera with a three-barbed arrow (Iliad V, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il5-hades]: Hades wounded by Heracles "in Pylos amid the dead" (Iliad V, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

## Variant Tradition

Dione's role as Aphrodite's mother stands in contrast to the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md)'s account of Aphrodite's birth from the sea-foam around [Uranus](uranus.md)'s severed members (Theogony 188-206). In the Iliad scene, [Zeus](zeus.md) also addresses Aphrodite as "my child," consistent with her being his daughter by Dione: "Not unto thee, my child, are given the works of war; but follow thou after the loving tasks of wedlock, and to all these things shall fleet [Ares](ares.md) and [Athena](athena.md) look."[^il5-zeus]

[^il5-zeus]: "Not unto thee, my child, are given the works of war; but follow thou after the loving tasks of wedlock, and to all these things shall fleet Ares and Athene look" (Iliad V.3003-3005, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

## In the Bibliotheca

Apollodorus lists Dione as one of the **Titanides**: "Tethys, Rhea, Themis, Mnemosyne, Phoebe, Dione, Thia."[^apd-dione-titanide] This is significant because the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md) places Dione among the Oceanids (Theogony 353), not among the Titans. By making her a Titanide, Apollodorus elevates her to the same rank as [Rhea](rhea.md) and [Themis](themis.md).

Consistently, Apollodorus names her as a consort of [Zeus](zeus.md): "by Dione he had [Aphrodite](aphrodite.md)."[^apd-dione-aphrodite]

[^apd-dione-titanide]: "also daughters, the Titanides as they are called: Tethys, Rhea, Themis, Mnemosyne, Phoebe, Dione, Thia" (Bibliotheca 1.1.3, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-dione-aphrodite]: "by Dione he had Aphrodite" (Bibliotheca 1.3.1, trans. Frazer)
