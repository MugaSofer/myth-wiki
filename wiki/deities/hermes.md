[^desc-luck]: "I sing of Cyllenian Hermes, the Slayer of Argus, lord of Cyllene and Arcadia rich in flocks, luck-bringing messenger of the deathless gods" (Homeric Hymn XVIII to Hermes 1-3, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Appearance

Hermes carries two signature items: "the wand of gold" and [Apollo](apollo.md)'s "shining whip," exchanged when they reconciled.[^desc-exchange]

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book XXIV, his equipment is described in detail when [Zeus](zeus.md) sends him to guide Priam: he binds on golden sandals "that bare him over wet sea and over the boundless land swift as the blast of the wind" and takes up his wand "wherewith he entranceth the eyes of such men as he will, and others he likewise waketh out of sleep."[^il24-equip] He disguises himself as "a young man, a prince, with the first down on his lip, as when the youth of men is the comeliest."[^il24-disguise]

[^desc-exchange]: "Phoebus Apollo took it, and readily put his shining whip in Hermes' hand, and ordained him keeper of herds" (Homeric Hymn IV to Hermes 497-498)
[^il24-equip]: "Forthwith then he bound beneath his feet his fair sandals, golden, divine, that bare him over wet sea and over the boundless land swift as the blast of the wind. And he took up his wand wherewith he entranceth the eyes of such men as he will, and others he likewise waketh out of sleep" (Iliad XXIV.14064-14069, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il24-disguise]: "he made him like a young man, a prince, with the first down on his lip, as when the youth of men is the comeliest" (Iliad XXIV.14073-14074)

## Powers

Hermes's wand can both induce and break sleep — he uses it to put the Greek sentinels to sleep so Priam can pass.[^il24-equip] He is the appointed "messenger to [Hades](hades.md),"[^hh4-domains] guide between the worlds of living and dead.

On the very day of his birth he invented fire ("it was Hermes who first invented fire-sticks and fire"), crafted the lyre from a tortoise shell, and stole fifty of [Apollo](apollo.md)'s divine cattle.[^hh4-theft] [Zeus](zeus.md) describes him through laughter — "Zeus laughed out loud to see his evil-plotting child well and cunningly denying guilt."[^hh4-zeus]

## Birth

"Maia, the daughter of [Atlas](atlas.md), bare to [Zeus](zeus.md) glorious Hermes, the herald of the deathless gods, for she went up into his holy bed."[^theog-birth]

[^theog-birth]: "Maia, the daughter of Atlas, bare to Zeus glorious Hermes, the herald of the deathless gods, for she went up into his holy bed" (Theogony 938-939, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Domains

Hermes is mentioned alongside [Hecate](hecate.md) in the care of herds: "[Hecate](hecate.md) is good in the byre with Hermes to increase the stock."[^theog-herds]

[^theog-herds]: "She is good in the byre with Hermes to increase the stock" (Theogony 444)

## Birth and the Theft of Apollo's Cattle (Hymn to Hermes)

The [Homeric Hymn to Hermes](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) (IV) is devoted entirely to Hermes's birth and first day of life. Maia bore him in "a deep, shady cave" on Cyllene, "unseen by deathless gods and mortal men, at dead of night while sweet sleep should hold white-armed [Hera](hera.md) fast." He is described as "of many shifts, blandly cunning, a robber, a cattle driver, a bringer of dreams, a watcher by night, a thief at the gates."[^hh4-birth]

### Invention of the Lyre

"Born with the dawning, at mid-day he played on the lyre." Finding a tortoise, he "first made the tortoise a singer" — cutting it open, stretching ox hide over the shell, and fitting "seven strings of sheep-gut." He sang of [Zeus](zeus.md) and Maia "telling all the glorious tale of his own begetting."[^hh4-lyre]

### The Cattle Theft

That same evening, "he stole the cattle of far-shooting [Apollo](apollo.md)." He cut fifty cows from Apollo's divine herd, reversed their hoof-prints, and wore wicker sandals to hide his tracks. He drove them to the river Alpheus, where "it was Hermes who first invented fire-sticks and fire." He sacrificed two cows, dividing the meat into twelve portions. Then he "passed edgeways through the key-hole of the hall like the autumn breeze" and returned to his cradle.[^hh4-theft]

### Before Zeus

When Apollo confronted him, Hermes denied everything: "I was born yesterday, and my feet are soft and the ground beneath is rough... whatever cows may be; for I know them only by hearsay." They went to [Zeus](zeus.md) for judgment. "Zeus laughed out loud to see his evil-plotting child well and cunningly denying guilt about the cattle."[^hh4-zeus]

### The Exchange

When Hermes played the lyre for Apollo, "the sweet throb of the marvellous music went to his heart, and a soft longing took hold on his soul." Apollo declared: "this song of yours is worth fifty cows." Hermes gave Apollo the lyre, and "Phoebus Apollo took it, and readily put his shining whip in Hermes' hand, and ordained him keeper of herds." [Zeus](zeus.md) "made them both friends."[^hh4-exchange]

### Domains Assigned

Apollo gave Hermes a golden staff "of riches and wealth" but denied him prophecy. Instead he gave him the three bee-maidens of Parnassus as teachers of a lesser divination. Zeus "commanded that glorious Hermes should be lord over all birds of omen and grim-eyed lions, and boars with gleaming tusks, and over dogs and all flocks... also that he only should be the appointed messenger to [Hades](hades.md)."[^hh4-domains]

[^hh4-birth]: "she bare a son, of many shifts, blandly cunning, a robber, a cattle driver, a bringer of dreams, a watcher by night, a thief at the gates, one who was soon to show forth wonderful deeds among the deathless gods" (Homeric Hymn IV to Hermes 13-16, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^hh4-lyre]: "Born with the dawning, at mid-day he played on the lyre... For it was Hermes who first made the tortoise a singer" (Homeric Hymn IV to Hermes 17, 25)
[^hh4-theft]: "he stole the cattle of far-shooting Apollo on the fourth day of the month... he bethought him of a crafty ruse and reversed the marks of their hoofs, making the front behind and the hind before" (Homeric Hymn IV to Hermes 18, 75-76)
[^hh4-zeus]: "Zeus laughed out loud to see his evil-plotting child well and cunningly denying guilt about the cattle. And he bade them both to be of one mind and search for the cattle" (Homeric Hymn IV to Hermes 389-392)
[^hh4-exchange]: "Phoebus Apollo took it, and readily put his shining whip in Hermes' hand, and ordained him keeper of herds. The son of Maia received it joyfully" (Homeric Hymn IV to Hermes 497-499)
[^hh4-domains]: "from heaven father Zeus himself gave confirmation to his words, and commanded that glorious Hermes should be lord over all birds of omen and grim-eyed lions, and boars with gleaming tusks, and over dogs and all flocks that the wide earth nourishes, and over all sheep; also that he only should be the appointed messenger to Hades" (Homeric Hymn IV to Hermes 568a-573)

## In the Hymn to Demeter

[Zeus](zeus.md) sent Hermes to retrieve [Persephone](persephone.md) from the underworld: "all-seeing Zeus the loud-thunderer... sent the Slayer of Argus whose wand is of gold to [Erebus](erebus.md), so that having won over [Hades](hades.md) with soft words, he might lead forth chaste Persephone to the light from the misty gloom."[^hd-mission]

Hermes told Hades: "Dark-haired Hades, ruler over the departed, father Zeus bids me bring noble Persephone forth from Erebus unto the gods." He then drove Persephone back in Hades's chariot: "the strong Slayer of Argos took reins and whip in his dear hands and drove forth from the hall, the horses speeding readily."[^hd-drive]

[^hd-mission]: "he sent the Slayer of Argus whose wand is of gold to Erebus, so that having won over Hades with soft words, he might lead forth chaste Persephone to the light from the misty gloom to join the gods, and that her mother might see her with her eyes and cease from her anger" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 334-339, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^hd-drive]: "the strong Slayer of Argos took reins and whip in his dear hands and drove forth from the hall, the horses speeding readily. Swiftly they traversed their long course, and neither the sea nor river-waters nor grassy glens nor mountain-peaks checked the career of the immortal horses" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 378-383)
