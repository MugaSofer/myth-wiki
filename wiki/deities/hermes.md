## Appearance

Hermes carries two signature items: "the [wand](../objects/hermes-wand.md) of gold" and [Apollo](apollo.md)'s "shining whip," exchanged when they reconciled.[^desc-exchange]

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book XXIV, his equipment is described in detail when [Zeus](zeus.md) sends him to guide Priam: he binds on golden sandals "that bare him over wet sea and over the boundless land swift as the blast of the wind" and takes up his wand "wherewith he entranceth the eyes of such men as he will, and others he likewise waketh out of sleep."[^il24-equip] He disguises himself as "a young man, a prince, with the first down on his lip, as when the youth of men is the comeliest."[^il24-disguise]

[^desc-exchange]: "Phoebus Apollo took it, and readily put his shining whip in Hermes' hand, and ordained him keeper of herds" (Homeric Hymn IV to Hermes 497-498)
[^il24-equip]: "Forthwith then he bound beneath his feet his fair sandals, golden, divine, that bare him over wet sea and over the boundless land swift as the blast of the wind. And he took up his wand wherewith he entranceth the eyes of such men as he will, and others he likewise waketh out of sleep" (Iliad XXIV.14064-14069, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il24-disguise]: "he made him like a young man, a prince, with the first down on his lip, as when the youth of men is the comeliest" (Iliad XXIV.14073-14074)

## Powers

Hermes's [wand](../objects/hermes-wand.md) can both induce and break sleep — he uses it to put the Greek sentinels to sleep so Priam can pass.[^il24-equip] He is the appointed "messenger to [Hades](hades.md),"[^hh4-domains] guide between the worlds of living and dead.

On the very day of his birth he invented fire ("it was Hermes who first invented fire-sticks and fire"), crafted the [lyre](../objects/lyre.md) from a tortoise shell, and stole fifty of [Apollo](apollo.md)'s divine cattle.[^hh4-theft] [Zeus](zeus.md) describes him through laughter — "Zeus laughed out loud to see his evil-plotting child well and cunningly denying guilt."[^hh4-zeus]

## Birth

"Maia, the daughter of [Atlas](atlas.md), bare to [Zeus](zeus.md) glorious Hermes, the herald of the deathless gods, for she went up into his holy bed."[^theog-birth]

[^theog-birth]: "Maia, the daughter of Atlas, bare to Zeus glorious Hermes, the herald of the deathless gods, for she went up into his holy bed" (Theogony 938-939, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Domains

Hermes is mentioned alongside [Hecate](hecate.md) in the care of herds: "[Hecate](hecate.md) is good in the byre with Hermes to increase the stock."[^theog-herds]

[^theog-herds]: "She is good in the byre with Hermes to increase the stock" (Theogony 444)

## Birth and the Theft of Apollo's Cattle (Hymn to Hermes)

The [Homeric Hymn to Hermes](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) (IV) is devoted entirely to Hermes's birth and first day of life. Maia bore him in "a deep, shady cave" on Cyllene, "unseen by deathless gods and mortal men, at dead of night while sweet sleep should hold white-armed [Hera](hera.md) fast." He is described as "of many shifts, blandly cunning, a robber, a cattle driver, a bringer of dreams, a watcher by night, a thief at the gates."[^hh4-birth]

### Invention of the Lyre

"Born with the dawning, at mid-day he played on the [lyre](../objects/lyre.md)." Finding a tortoise, he "first made the tortoise a singer" — cutting it open, stretching ox hide over the shell, and fitting "seven strings of sheep-gut." He sang of [Zeus](zeus.md) and Maia "telling all the glorious tale of his own begetting."[^hh4-lyre]

### The Cattle Theft

That same evening, "he stole the cattle of far-shooting [Apollo](apollo.md)." He cut fifty cows from Apollo's divine herd, reversed their hoof-prints, and wore wicker sandals to hide his tracks. He drove them to the river Alpheus, where "it was Hermes who first invented fire-sticks and fire." He sacrificed two cows, dividing the meat into twelve portions. Then he "passed edgeways through the key-hole of the hall like the autumn breeze" and returned to his cradle.[^hh4-theft]

### Before Zeus

When Apollo confronted him, Hermes denied everything: "I was born yesterday, and my feet are soft and the ground beneath is rough... whatever cows may be; for I know them only by hearsay." They went to [Zeus](zeus.md) for judgment. "Zeus laughed out loud to see his evil-plotting child well and cunningly denying guilt about the cattle."[^hh4-zeus]

### The Exchange

When Hermes played the [lyre](../objects/lyre.md) for Apollo, "the sweet throb of the marvellous music went to his heart, and a soft longing took hold on his soul." Apollo declared: "this song of yours is worth fifty cows." Hermes gave Apollo the lyre, and "Phoebus Apollo took it, and readily put his shining whip in Hermes' hand, and ordained him keeper of herds." [Zeus](zeus.md) "made them both friends."[^hh4-exchange]

### Domains Assigned

Apollo gave Hermes a golden staff "of riches and wealth" but denied him prophecy. Instead he gave him the three bee-maidens of Parnassus as teachers of a lesser divination. Zeus "commanded that glorious Hermes should be lord over all birds of omen and grim-eyed lions, and boars with gleaming tusks, and over dogs and all flocks... also that he only should be the appointed messenger to [Hades](hades.md)."[^hh4-domains]

[^hh4-birth]: "she bare a son, of many shifts, blandly cunning, a robber, a cattle driver, a bringer of dreams, a watcher by night, a thief at the gates, one who was soon to show forth wonderful deeds among the deathless gods" (Homeric Hymn IV to Hermes 13-16, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^hh4-lyre]: "Born with the dawning, at mid-day he played on the lyre... For it was Hermes who first made the tortoise a singer" (Homeric Hymn IV to Hermes 17, 25)
[^hh4-theft]: "he stole the cattle of far-shooting Apollo on the fourth day of the month... he bethought him of a crafty ruse and reversed the marks of their hoofs, making the front behind and the hind before" (Homeric Hymn IV to Hermes 18, 75-76)
[^hh4-zeus]: "Zeus laughed out loud to see his evil-plotting child well and cunningly denying guilt about the cattle. And he bade them both to be of one mind and search for the cattle" (Homeric Hymn IV to Hermes 389-392)
[^hh4-exchange]: "Phoebus Apollo took it, and readily put his shining whip in Hermes' hand, and ordained him keeper of herds. The son of Maia received it joyfully" (Homeric Hymn IV to Hermes 497-499)
[^hh4-domains]: "from heaven father Zeus himself gave confirmation to his words, and commanded that glorious Hermes should be lord over all birds of omen and grim-eyed lions, and boars with gleaming tusks, and over dogs and all flocks that the wide earth nourishes, and over all sheep; also that he only should be the appointed messenger to Hades" (Homeric Hymn IV to Hermes 568a-573)

## In the Fabulae

### The Interpreter (§143)

The [Fabulae](../sources/hyginus.md) tells of Hermes's (Mercury's) role in creating language diversity. "Inachus, son of Oceanus, begat Phoroneus by his sister Argia, and he is said to have been the first of mortals to rule."[^hyg-143-phoroneus] Before this time, unity prevailed: "Men for many centuries before lived without town or laws, speaking one tongue under the rule of Jove [[Zeus](zeus.md)]."[^hyg-143-unity]

Hermes created division: "But after Mercury had explained the languages of men (when he is called ermeneutes, 'interpreter,' for Mercury in Greek is called Hermes; he too, divided the nations), then discord arose among mortals, which was not pleasing to Jove."[^hyg-143-division]

The consequence was the first human kingdom: "And so he gave over the first rule to Phoroneus, because hew as first to make offerings to Juno [[Hera](hera.md)]."[^hyg-143-first]

[^hyg-143-phoroneus]: "Inachus, son of Oceanus, begat Phoroneus by his sister Argia, and he is said to have been the first of mortals to rule." (Fabulae §143, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-143-unity]: "Men for many centuries before lived without town or laws, speaking one tongue under the rule of Jove." (Fabulae §143, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-143-division]: "But after Mercury had explained the languages of men (when he is called ermeneutes, 'interpreter,' for Mercury in Greek is called Hermes; he too, divided the nations), then discord arose among mortals, which was not pleasing to Jove." (Fabulae §143, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-143-first]: "And so he gave over the first rule to Phoroneus, because hew as first to make offerings to Juno." (Fabulae §143, trans. Mary Grant)

### Autolycus (§201)

Hermes gave his son Autolycus remarkable powers. "Mercury gave to Autolycus, whom he begat by Chione, the gift of being such a skilful thief that he could not be caught, making him able to change whatever he stole into some other form — from white to black, or from black to white, from a hornless animal to a horned one, or from horned one to a hornless."[^hyg-201-gift]

Sisyphus detected the theft through cleverness: "When he kept continually stealing from the herds of Sisyphus and couldn't be caught, Sisyphus was convinced he was stealing because Autolycus' number was increasing while his was growing smaller. In order to catch him, he put a mark on the hooves of his cattle."[^hyg-201-mark]

The confrontation led to seduction: "When Autolycus had stolen in his usual way, Sisyphus came to him and identified the cattle he had stolen by their hooves, and took them away. While he was delaying there, he seduced Anticleia, the daughter of Autolycus."[^hyg-201-anticleia]

This union had consequences for [Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md): "She was later given in marriage to Laertes, and bore Ulysses. Some writers accordingly call him Sisyphean; because of this parentage he was shrewd."[^hyg-201-odysseus]

[^hyg-201-gift]: "Mercury gave to Autolycus, whom he begat by Chione, the gift of being such a skilful thief that he could not be caught, making him able to change whatever he stole into some other form — from white to black, or from black to white, from a hornless animal to a horned one, or from horned one to a hornless." (Fabulae §201, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-201-mark]: "When he kept continually stealing from the herds of Sisyphus and couldn't be caught, Sisyphus was convinced he was stealing because Autolycus' number was increasing while his was growing smaller. In order to catch him, he put a mark on the hooves of his cattle." (Fabulae §201, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-201-anticleia]: "When Autolycus had stolen in his usual way, Sisyphus came to him and identified the cattle he had stolen by their hooves, and took them away. While he was delaying there, he seduced Anticleia, the daughter of Autolycus." (Fabulae §201, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-201-odysseus]: "She was later given in marriage to Laertes, and bore Ulysses. Some writers accordingly call him Sisyphean; because of this parentage he was shrewd." (Fabulae §201, trans. Mary Grant)

## In the Hymn to Demeter

[Zeus](zeus.md) sent Hermes to retrieve [Persephone](persephone.md) from the underworld: "all-seeing Zeus the loud-thunderer... sent the Slayer of Argus whose wand is of gold to [Erebus](erebus.md), so that having won over [Hades](hades.md) with soft words, he might lead forth chaste Persephone to the light from the misty gloom."[^hd-mission]

Hermes told Hades: "Dark-haired Hades, ruler over the departed, father Zeus bids me bring noble Persephone forth from Erebus unto the gods." He then drove Persephone back in Hades's chariot: "the strong Slayer of Argos took reins and whip in his dear hands and drove forth from the hall, the horses speeding readily."[^hd-drive]

[^hd-mission]: "he sent the Slayer of Argus whose wand is of gold to Erebus, so that having won over Hades with soft words, he might lead forth chaste Persephone to the light from the misty gloom to join the gods, and that her mother might see her with her eyes and cease from her anger" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 334-339, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^hd-drive]: "the strong Slayer of Argos took reins and whip in his dear hands and drove forth from the hall, the horses speeding readily. Swiftly they traversed their long course, and neither the sea nor river-waters nor grassy glens nor mountain-peaks checked the career of the immortal horses" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 378-383)

## In the Odyssey

### Embassy to [Calypso](calypso.md) (Book V)

In [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) Book V, [Zeus](zeus.md) sends Hermes to [Calypso](calypso.md) to command Odysseus's release. His equipment mirrors the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) XXIV description: "Straightway he bound beneath his feet his lovely golden sandals, that wax not old, that bare him alike over the wet sea and over the limitless land, swift as the breath of the wind. And he took the [wand](../objects/hermes-wand.md) wherewith he lulls the eyes of whomso he will, while others again he even wakes from out of sleep."[^od5-equip]

His flight is described vividly: "Above Pieria he passed and leapt from the upper air into the deep. Then he sped along the wave like the cormorant, that chaseth the fishes through the perilous gulfs of the unharvested sea, and wetteth his thick plumage in the brine."[^od5-flight]

At Calypso's cave, he delivers Zeus's command, warning: "it is in no wise possible for another god to go beyond or to make void the purpose of Zeus, lord of the aegis."[^od5-command]

[^od5-equip]: "Straightway he bound beneath his feet his lovely golden sandals, that wax not old, that bare him alike over the wet sea and over the limitless land, swift as the breath of the wind. And he took the wand wherewith he lulls the eyes of whomso he will, while others again he even wakes from out of sleep." (Odyssey V.3026-3030, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od5-flight]: "Above Pieria he passed and leapt from the upper air into the deep. Then he sped along the wave like the cormorant, that chaseth the fishes through the perilous gulfs of the unharvested sea, and wetteth his thick plumage in the brine." (Odyssey V.3031-3034, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od5-command]: "surely it is in no wise possible for another god to go beyond or to make void the purpose of Zeus, lord of the aegis" (Odyssey V.3079-3080, trans. Butcher and Lang)

### The Embassy to Aegisthus (Book I)

In the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md), [Zeus](zeus.md) recalls sending Hermes to warn Aegisthus against murdering Agamemnon and seducing his wife: "we had warned him by the embassy of Hermes the keen-sighted, the slayer of Argos, that he should neither kill the man, nor woo his wife. For the son of Atreus shall be avenged at the hand of Orestes, so soon as he shall come to man's estate and long for his own country. So spake Hermes, yet he prevailed not on the heart of Aegisthus, for all his good will."[^od1-aegisthus]

[Athena](athena.md) also proposes sending Hermes to Calypso on Ogygia to declare the gods' counsel "even the return of the patient Odysseus."[^od1-ogygia]

[^od1-aegisthus]: "we had warned him by the embassy of Hermes the keen-sighted, the slayer of Argos, that he should neither kill the man, nor woo his wife. For the son of Atreus shall be avenged at the hand of Orestes, so soon as he shall come to man's estate and long for his own country. So spake Hermes, yet he prevailed not on the heart of Aegisthus, for all his good will" (Odyssey I.764-768, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od1-ogygia]: "let us then speed Hermes the Messenger, the slayer of Argos, to the island of Ogygia. There with all speed let him declare to the lady of the braided tresses our unerring counsel, even the return of the patient Odysseus" (Odyssey I.807-810, trans. Butcher and Lang)

### The Song of Ares and Aphrodite (Book VIII)

In the Song of [Ares](ares.md) and [Aphrodite](aphrodite.md), Hermes is among the gods who gather to witness the trapped lovers. When [Apollo](apollo.md) asked him if he would endure the bonds to lie with golden Aphrodite, "the messenger, the slayer of Argos, answered him: 'I would that this might be, Apollo, my prince of archery! So might thrice as many bonds innumerable encompass me about, and all ye gods be looking on and all the goddesses, yet would I lie by golden Aphrodite.'" His answer provoked "laughter among the deathless gods."[^od8-hermes-wish]

[^od8-hermes-wish]: "the messenger, the slayer of Argos, answered him: 'I would that this might be, Apollo, my prince of archery! So might thrice as many bonds innumerable encompass me about, and all ye gods be looking on and all the goddesses, yet would I lie by golden Aphrodite.' So spake he, and laughter rose among the deathless gods" (Odyssey VIII.4478-4483, trans. Butcher and Lang)

### Hermes, Patron of Service (Book XIV–XV)

In [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) Book XIV, the swineherd Eumaeus sets aside a sacrifice portion "for the nymphs and for Hermes son of Maia" — showing Hermes's place in everyday rural worship.[^od14-sacrifice]

Later, in Book XV, Odysseus (in disguise) invokes Hermes's patronage of skilled labour: "By the favour of Hermes, the messenger, who gives grace and glory to all men's work, no mortal may vie with me in the business of a serving-man."[^od15-grace]

[^od14-sacrifice]: "One, when he had prayed, he set aside for the nymphs and for Hermes son of Maia, and the rest he distributed to each." (Odyssey XIV.7840-7842, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od15-grace]: "By the favour of Hermes, the messenger, who gives grace and glory to all men's work, no mortal may vie with me in the business of a serving-man, in piling well a fire, in cleaving dry faggots, and in carving and roasting flesh and in pouring of wine" (Odyssey XV.8285-8289, trans. Butcher and Lang)

### Hermes and Autolycus (Book XIX)

In [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) Book XIX, the narrator explains that Odysseus's maternal grandfather Autolycus "outdid all men in thievery and skill in swearing. This skill was the gift of the god himself, even Hermes, for that he burned to him the well-pleasing sacrifice of the thighs of lambs and kids; wherefore Hermes abetted him gladly."[^od19-autolycus]

This passage connects directly to Hermes's established domain as patron of thieves — the "thief at the gates" from Hymn IV — showing a mortal lineage blessed by the god's favour. Through Autolycus, Hermes's gift of cunning passes into Odysseus's bloodline.

[^od19-autolycus]: "Autolycus, his mother's noble father, who outdid all men in thievery and skill in swearing. This skill was the gift of the god himself, even Hermes, for that he burned to him the well-pleasing sacrifice of the thighs of lambs and kids; wherefore Hermes abetted him gladly." (Odyssey XIX.10544-10548, trans. Butcher and Lang)

### Psychopomp — Guide of the Dead (Book XXIV)

In [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) Book XXIV, Hermes performs his role as guide of the dead — the "appointed messenger to [Hades](hades.md)" from Hymn IV. He summons the slain suitors' souls with his wand: "Now Cyllenian Hermes called forth from the halls the souls of the wooers, and he held in his hand his wand that is fair and golden, wherewith he lulls the eyes of men, of whomso he will, while others again he even wakens out of sleep. Herewith he roused and led the souls who followed gibbering."[^od24-summon]

The souls are compared to bats: "even as bats flit gibbering in the secret place of a wondrous cave, when one has fallen down from the cluster on the rock, where they cling each to each up aloft, even so the souls gibbered as they fared together."[^od24-bats]

Hermes then leads them on their journey to the underworld: "Hermes, the helper, led them down the dank ways. Past the streams of Oceanus and the White Rock, past the gates of the Sun they sped and the land of dreams, and soon they came to the mead of asphodel, where dwell the souls, the phantoms of men outworn."[^od24-journey]

This is the only time in the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) where Hermes actually performs his role as psychopomp. His wand description here closely matches both the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) XXIV and Odyssey V descriptions — in all three, it "lulls the eyes of men" and "wakens" others from sleep.

[^od24-summon]: "Now Cyllenian Hermes called forth from the halls the souls of the wooers, and he held in his hand his wand that is fair and golden, wherewith he lulls the eyes of men, of whomso he will, while others again he even wakens out of sleep. Herewith he roused and led the souls who followed gibbering." (Odyssey XXIV.12554-12558, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od24-bats]: "even as bats flit gibbering in the secret place of a wondrous cave, when one has fallen down from the cluster on the rock, where they cling each to each up aloft, even so the souls gibbered as they fared together" (Odyssey XXIV.12558-12561, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od24-journey]: "Hermes, the helper, led them down the dank ways. Past the streams of Oceanus and the White Rock, past the gates of the Sun they sped and the land of dreams, and soon they came to the mead of asphodel, where dwell the souls, the phantoms of men outworn." (Odyssey XXIV.12561-12565, trans. Butcher and Lang)

### Hermes and Moly (Book X)

In [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) Book X, Hermes appears to Odysseus on his way to Circe's hall, again taking the form of a youth: "Hermes, of the golden wand, meet me as I approached the house, in the likeness of a young man with the first down on his lip, the time when youth is most gracious. So he clasped my hand and spake and hailed me."[^od10-appear]

He warns Odysseus about Circe and gives him the protective herb moly: "Lo, take this herb of virtue, and go to the dwelling of Circe, that it may keep from thy head the evil day... When it shall be that Circe smites thee with her long wand, even then draw thou thy sharp sword from thy thigh, and spring on her, as one eager to slay her."[^od10-warn]

The herb itself is described in detail: "the slayer of Argos gave me the plant that he had plucked from the ground, and he showed me the growth thereof. It was black at the root, but the flower was like to milk. Moly the gods call it, but it is hard for mortal men to dig; howbeit with the gods all things are possible."[^od10-moly]

Hermes then departs: "Then Hermes departed toward high Olympus, up through the woodland isle."[^od10-depart] Later, when Odysseus resists her magic, Circe recognizes him because of Hermes: "Verily thou art Odysseus, ready at need, whom he of the golden wand, the slayer of Argos, full often told me was to come hither, on his way from Troy with his swift black ship."[^od10-circe]

[^od10-appear]: "Hermes, of the golden wand, meet me as I approached the house, in the likeness of a young man with the first down on his lip, the time when youth is most gracious. So he clasped my hand and spake and hailed me" (Odyssey X.5587-5590, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od10-warn]: "Lo, take this herb of virtue, and go to the dwelling of Circe, that it may keep from thy head the evil day... When it shall be that Circe smites thee with her long wand, even then draw thou thy sharp sword from thy thigh, and spring on her, as one eager to slay her." (Odyssey X.5597-5605, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od10-moly]: "the slayer of Argos gave me the plant that he had plucked from the ground, and he showed me the growth thereof. It was black at the root, but the flower was like to milk. Moly the gods call it, but it is hard for mortal men to dig; howbeit with the gods all things are possible." (Odyssey X.5612-5616, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od10-depart]: "Then Hermes departed toward high Olympus, up through the woodland isle" (Odyssey X.5618, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od10-circe]: "Verily thou art Odysseus, ready at need, whom he of the golden wand, the slayer of Argos, full often told me was to come hither, on his way from Troy with his swift black ship." (Odyssey X.5645-5647, trans. Butcher and Lang)

## In the Bibliotheca

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) adds several roles for Hermes. He rescued [Ares](ares.md) from imprisonment by the Aloads (Otus and Ephialtes): "Hermes rescued Ares by stealth."[^apd-ares] This confirms the Iliad V account but specifies stealth rather than the Iliad's detail about Eeriboea reporting to Hermes.

He also gave a golden ram to Nephele, which carried her children Phrixus and Helle through the sky to escape sacrifice. Helle fell into the sea (creating the Hellespont), while Phrixus reached Colchis.[^apd-ram]

In the Deucalion flood narrative, [Zeus](zeus.md) sent Hermes to the surviving Deucalion "and allowed him to choose what he would, and he chose to get men."[^apd-deucalion]

Hermes is also listed as father of Autolycus among the Argonauts.[^apd-autolycus]

### Restoring Zeus's Sinews (1.6.3)

During the battle with [Typhoeus](../creatures/typhoeus.md), after Typhon severed [Zeus](zeus.md)'s sinews and hid them in the Corycian cave, "Hermes and Aegipan stole the sinews and fitted them unobserved to Zeus."[^apd-herm-sinews]

> **NEW DETAIL:** Hermes as rescuer of Zeus is not found in the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md). Aegipan (a goat-like figure sometimes identified with [Pan](pan.md)) is his partner in this exploit.

### Killing Argus — Origin of "Argiphontes" (2.1.3)

[Zeus](zeus.md) ordered Hermes to steal the cow [Io](../heroes/io.md), guarded by Argus the All-seeing. "As Hermes could not do it secretly because Hierax had blabbed, he killed Argus by the cast of a stone; whence he was called Argiphontes."[^apd-herm-argus] He also purified the Danaids alongside [Athena](athena.md) at [Zeus](zeus.md)'s command.[^apd-herm-danaids]

### Aiding Perseus (2.4.2-2.4.3)

Hermes accompanied [Perseus](../heroes/perseus.md) alongside [Athena](athena.md) to the daughters of Phorcus. He "received also from Hermes an adamantine sickle" for the quest.[^apd-herm-sickle] Afterwards, Perseus returned the nymphs' items via Hermes: "Hermes restored the aforesaid things to the nymphs."[^apd-herm-restore]

### Aiding and Selling Heracles (2.4.11, 2.5.12, 2.6.3)

Hermes gave [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) a sword among his divine weapons.[^apd-herm-sword] In the underworld during the Cerberus labour, Hermes informed Heracles that the Gorgon Medusa "was an empty phantom."[^apd-herm-phantom] After the oracle decreed Heracles must be sold for three years, "Hermes sold Hercules, and he was bought by Omphale."[^apd-herm-sold]

[^apd-herm-argus]: "Zeus ordered Hermes to steal the cow, and as Hermes could not do it secretly because Hierax had blabbed, he killed Argus by the cast of a stone; whence he was called Argiphontes" (Bibliotheca 2.1.3, trans. J.G. Frazer)

## In the Great Eoiae

### The Cattle Theft and Battus (Fragment 16)

The Great Eoiae gives a variant of the cattle-theft more elaborate than the [Homeric Hymn](../sources/homeric-hymns.md). While [Apollo](apollo.md) was distracted by love for the boy Hymenaeus at the house of Magnes, Hermes "cast upon the dogs which were guarding them a stupor and strangles" and drove away twelve heifers, a hundred cows, and the bull, "fastening to the tail of each one brushwood to wipe out the footmarks."[^ge-cattle]

He drove the cattle through vast distances — through the lands of the Pelasgi, Achaea, Locris, Boeotia, and into the Peloponnese. A man named Battus, living on a hilltop, heard the heifers pass and recognised they were stolen. Hermes promised him a reward to tell no one, and Battus swore silence. But Hermes, disguised, returned and offered Battus a robe to reveal what he knew. Battus broke his oath and told. "Hermes was angry because he was double-tongued, and struck him with his staff and changed him into a rock. And either frost or heat never leaves him."[^ge-battus]

[^ge-cattle]: "he cast upon the dogs which were guarding them a stupor and strangles, so that the dogs forgot the cows and lost the power of barking... fastening to the tail of each one brushwood to wipe out the footmarks of the cows" (Great Eoiae, Fragment 16, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^ge-battus]: "Hermes was angry because he was double-tongued, and struck him with his staff and changed him into a rock. And either frost or heat never leaves him" (Great Eoiae, Fragment 16, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md)

### Appearance in the Metamorphoses

When Mercury descends to court Herse, the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md) gives his fullest physical description. "Though he knew his face was beautiful, he combed his hair, and fixed his flowing raiment, that the fringe of radiant gold appeared. And in his hand he waved his long smooth wand, with which he gives the wakeful sleep or waketh ridded eyes. He proudly glanced upon his twinkling feet that sparkled with their scintillating wings."[^met-herm-appearance]

[^met-herm-appearance]: "though he knew his face was beautiful, he combed his hair, and fixed his flowing raiment, that the fringe of radiant gold appeared. And in his hand he waved his long smooth wand, with which he gives the wakeful sleep or waketh ridded eyes. He proudly glanced upon his twinkling feet that sparkled with their scintillating wings" (Metamorphoses 2.731-737, trans. Brookes More)

### Slaying Argus (1.668-730)

When [Zeus](zeus.md) could no longer endure [Io](../heroes/io.md)'s suffering as a heifer under Argus's watch, "he called his son, whom Maia brightest of the Pleiades brought forth, and bade him slay the star eyed guard, Argus."[^met-herm-called] Mercury descended to earth in disguise: "he seized his sleep compelling wand and fastened waving wings on his swift feet, and deftly fixed his brimmed hat on his head" — then "put off his cap and wings, though still retained his wand with which he drove through pathless wilds some stray she goats, and as a shepherd fared, piping on oaten reeds melodious tunes."[^met-herm-disguise]

Argus invited this shepherd to sit with him, and Mercury played the pipes and told stories to lull those hundred eyes. He told the tale of [Pan](pan.md) and the nymph Syrinx to bring on sleep. "When Pan had told his tale to her, and she despised his prayers" she fled to the river Ladon and was transformed into marsh reeds, from which Pan fashioned his pipes.[^met-herm-syrinx]

When Argus finally slumbered, Mercury struck: "he touched the drooping eyelids with his magic wand, compelling slumber. Then without delay he struck the sleeper with his crescent sword, where neck and head unite, and hurled his head, blood dripping, down the rocks."[^met-herm-strike] [Hera](hera.md) then "spread their glister on the feathers of her bird, emblazoning its tail with starry gems" — placing Argus's hundred eyes upon the peacock's tail.[^met-herm-peacock]

[^met-herm-called]: "The sovereign god no longer could endure to witness Io's woes. He called his son, whom Maia brightest of the Pleiades brought forth, and bade him slay the star eyed guard, Argus" (Metamorphoses 1.668-671, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-herm-disguise]: "he seized his sleep compelling wand and fastened waving wings on his swift feet, and deftly fixed his brimmed hat on his head... put off his cap and wings, though still retained his wand with which he drove through pathless wilds some stray she goats, and as a shepherd fared, piping on oaten reeds melodious tunes" (Metamorphoses 1.671-677)
[^met-herm-syrinx]: "A famous Naiad dwelt among the Hamadryads, on the cold Arcadian summit Nonacris, whose name was Syrinx... she implored her sister Nymphs to change her form: and Pan, believing he had caught her, held instead some marsh reeds for the body of the Nymph" (Metamorphoses 1.689-710)
[^met-herm-strike]: "he touched the drooping eyelids with his magic wand, compelling slumber. Then without delay he struck the sleeper with his crescent sword, where neck and head unite, and hurled his head, blood dripping, down the rocks and rugged cliff" (Metamorphoses 1.712-716)
[^met-herm-peacock]: "Saturn's daughter spread their glister on the feathers of her bird, emblazoning its tail with starry gems" (Metamorphoses 1.717-719)

### Philemon and Baucis (8.626-724)

Mercury accompanied [Jupiter](zeus.md) disguised as mortal travellers, testing human hospitality. "As weary travelers over all the land they wandered, begging for their food and bed; and of a thousand houses, all the doors were bolted and no word of kindness given."[^met-herm-philemon1] Only the aged couple Philemon and Baucis welcomed them in their humble cottage.

The divine nature of the guests was revealed when the wine-bowl miraculously refilled itself: "the wine-bowl often drained, as often was replenished, though unfilled, and Baucis and Philemon, full of fear, as they observed the wine spontaneous well, increasing when it should diminish, raised their hands in supplication."[^met-herm-philemon2]

The gods punished the inhospitable neighbourhood by flooding the land, but transformed the couple's cottage into a marble temple. When asked their desire, Philemon and Baucis asked to serve the temple and to die together. Their wish was granted: standing before the sacred steps, "Baucis saw Philemon, her old husband, and he, too, saw Baucis, as their bodies put forth leaves; and while the tops of trees grew over them, above their faces,—they spoke each to each; as long as they could speak they said, 'Farewell, farewell, my own.'"[^met-herm-philemon3]

[^met-herm-philemon1]: "as weary travelers over all the land they wandered, begging for their food and bed; and of a thousand houses, all the doors were bolted and no word of kindness given" (Metamorphoses 8.633-636, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-herm-philemon2]: "the wine-bowl often drained, as often was replenished, though unfilled, and Baucis and Philemon, full of fear, as they observed the wine spontaneous well, increasing when it should diminish, raised their hands in supplication" (Metamorphoses 8.678-682)
[^met-herm-philemon3]: "Baucis saw Philemon, her old husband, and he, too, saw Baucis, as their bodies put forth leaves; and while the tops of trees grew over them, above their faces,—they spoke each to each; as long as they could speak they said, 'Farewell, farewell, my own'" (Metamorphoses 8.717-723)
