## The Abduction (Hymn to Demeter)

The [Homeric Hymn to Demeter](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) tells the full story of Persephone's abduction. She was "playing with the deep-bosomed daughters of [Oceanus](oceanus.md) and gathering flowers over a soft meadow, roses and crocuses and beautiful violets, irises also and hyacinths and the narcissus, which Earth made to grow at the will of [Zeus](zeus.md) and to please the Host of Many, to be a snare for the bloom-like girl."[^hd-flowers]

"The wide-pathed earth yawned there in the plain of Nysa, and the lord, Host of Many, with his immortal horses sprang out upon her... He caught her up reluctant on his golden car and bare her away lamenting."[^hd-seized]

### The Pomegranate

When [Zeus](zeus.md) sent [Hermes](hermes.md) to bring her back, [Hades](hades.md) told her to go but "secretly gave her sweet pomegranate seed to eat, taking care for himself that she might not remain continually with grave, dark-robed [Demeter](demeter.md)." Persephone later told her mother: "he secretly put in my mouth sweet food, a pomegranate seed, and forced me to taste against my will."[^hd-pomegranate]

### The Division of the Year

Because she had eaten in the underworld, Persephone must "go back again beneath the secret places of the earth, there to dwell a third part of the seasons every year: yet for the two parts" she would be with [Demeter](demeter.md) and the other gods.[^hd-division]

### Hecate

After her return, [Hecate](hecate.md) "often did she embrace the daughter of holy [Demeter](demeter.md): and from that time the lady Hecate was minister and companion to Persephone."[^hd-hecate]

### Hades's Promise

[Hades](hades.md) told Persephone before releasing her: "while you are here, you shall rule all that lives and moves and shall have the greatest rights among the deathless gods: those who defraud you and do not appease your power with offerings, reverently performing rites and paying fit gifts, shall be punished for evermore."[^hd-rule]

[^hd-flowers]: "she was playing with the deep-bosomed daughters of Oceanus and gathering flowers over a soft meadow, roses and crocuses and beautiful violets, irises also and hyacinths and the narcissus, which Earth made to grow at the will of Zeus and to please the Host of Many, to be a snare for the bloom-like girl" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 5-11, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^hd-seized]: "the wide-pathed earth yawned there in the plain of Nysa, and the lord, Host of Many, with his immortal horses sprang out upon her... He caught her up reluctant on his golden car and bare her away lamenting" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 16-20)
[^hd-pomegranate]: "he on his part secretly gave her sweet pomegranate seed to eat, taking care for himself that she might not remain continually with grave, dark-robed Demeter" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 371-374)
[^hd-division]: "if you have tasted food, you must go back again beneath the secret places of the earth, there to dwell a third part of the seasons every year: yet for the two parts you shall be with me and the other deathless gods" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 398-403)
[^hd-hecate]: "bright-coiffed Hecate came near to them, and often did she embrace the daughter of holy Demeter: and from that time the lady Hecate was minister and companion to Persephone" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 438-440)
[^hd-rule]: "while you are here, you shall rule all that lives and moves and shall have the greatest rights among the deathless gods: those who defraud you and do not appease your power with offerings, reverently performing rites and paying fit gifts, shall be punished for evermore" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 364-369)

## In the Odyssey

Persephone plays a major role in Book XI of the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md), the Nekuia (descent to Hades). Teiresias retains his judgment "even in death" because "Persephone hath given judgment" to him alone.[^od10-teiresias] Anticleia explains the nature of death to Odysseus, assuring him that "Persephone, the daughter of Zeus, doth in no wise deceive thee."[^od11-anticleia] As queen of the dead, "holy Persephone had scattered this way and that the spirits of the women folk" — she is "the high goddess Persephone" who sends forth the catalogue of heroines.[^od11-catalogue] As Odysseus lingers, he fears she may "send me the head of the Gorgon, that dread monster, from out of Hades."[^od11-gorgon]

[^od10-teiresias]: "Persephone hath given judgment" (Odyssey XI.5812-5813, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od11-anticleia]: "Persephone, the daughter of Zeus, doth in no wise deceive thee" (Odyssey XI.6102, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od11-catalogue]: "holy Persephone had scattered this way and that the spirits of the women folk" (Odyssey XI.6267, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od11-gorgon]: "send me the head of the Gorgon, that dread monster, from out of Hades" (Odyssey XI.6515, trans. Butcher and Lang)

## In the Bibliotheca (1.5.1-1.5.3)

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) retells the abduction and return with some notable details.

[Hades](hades.md) "fell in love with Persephone and with the help of [Zeus](zeus.md) carried her off secretly."[^apd-pers-abduct] When Zeus ordered her return, Hades "gave her a seed of a pomegranate to eat, in order that she might not tarry long with her mother. Not foreseeing the consequence, she swallowed it."[^apd-pers-pomegranate]

Ascalaphus, "son of Acheron and Gorgyra, bore witness against her" — testifying that she had eaten in the underworld. [Demeter](demeter.md) punished him by laying "a heavy rock on him in Hades."[^apd-pers-ascalaphus]

"Persephone was compelled to remain a third of every year with Pluto and the rest of the time with the gods."[^apd-pers-division]

> **NOTE:** The one-third / two-thirds division matches the [Homeric Hymn to Demeter](../sources/homeric-hymns.md). The Bibliotheca adds the figure of Ascalaphus as witness and the detail that Persephone swallowed the pomegranate seed "not foreseeing the consequence."

[^apd-pers-abduct]: "Pluto fell in love with Persephone and with the help of Zeus carried her off secretly." (Bibliotheca 1.5.1, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-pers-pomegranate]: "Pluto gave her a seed of a pomegranate to eat, in order that she might not tarry long with her mother. Not foreseeing the consequence, she swallowed it" (Bibliotheca 1.5.3, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-pers-ascalaphus]: "because Ascalaphus, son of Acheron and Gorgyra, bore witness against her, Demeter laid a heavy rock on him in Hades." (Bibliotheca 1.5.3, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-pers-division]: "Persephone was compelled to remain a third of every year with Pluto and the rest of the time with the gods." (Bibliotheca 1.5.3, trans. Frazer)

## Variant Traditions

### Parentage: Zeus and Styx (Bibliotheca) vs Zeus and Demeter (Theogony)

Apollodorus records a striking variant: "by [Styx](styx.md) he had Persephone."[^apd-persephone-styx] All other sources — the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md), the [Homeric Hymn to Demeter](../sources/homeric-hymns.md), and the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) — name [Demeter](demeter.md) as Persephone's mother. Making Styx (an Oceanid associated with death and the underworld oath) the mother instead of Demeter (goddess of grain and fertility) would fundamentally alter Persephone's mythological significance, linking her to the underworld by birth rather than by abduction alone.

[^apd-persephone-styx]: "by Styx he had Persephone" (Bibliotheca 1.3.1, trans. Frazer)

## In the Fabulae

### The Abduction on Mount Etna (§146)

The [Fabulae](../sources/hyginus.md) gives a strikingly different setting for Persephone's abduction. "[Pluto](hades.md) asked from [Jove](zeus.md) that he give him in marriage [Ceres](demeter.md)' daughter and his own."[^hyg-146-request] This detail — that Pluto explicitly requested permission from Zeus — appears in some traditions but is made explicit here.

"Jove said that Ceres would not permit her daughter to live in gloomy [Tartarus](../places/tartarus.md), but bade him seize her as she was gathering flowers on Mount Etna, which is in Sicily."[^hyg-146-etna] The location of **Mount Etna** is a significant variant — the [Homeric Hymn](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) places the abduction "in the plain of Nysa," while Hyginus specifies the volcanic mountain in Sicily.

Even more striking is the detail of who accompanied her: "While Proserpina was gathering flowers with [Venus](../deities/aphrodite.md), [Diana](../deities/artemis.md), and [Minerva](athena.md), [Pluto](hades.md) came in his four-horse chariot, and seized her."[^hyg-146-companions] This is radically different from the Homeric version, where Persephone gathered flowers "with the deep-bosomed daughters of Oceanus." Here, three major Olympian goddesses — Aphrodite, Artemis, and Athena — are present at the moment of abduction, yet unable (or unwilling) to prevent it.

The resolution follows the standard pattern: "Afterwards Ceres obtained from Jove permission for her to stay half of the year with her, and half with Pluto."[^hyg-146-division] This differs from the usual one-third/two-thirds division and matches the seasonal symbolism more precisely (six months above, six below).

## In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md)

### The Abduction at Henna (5.385-408)

Ovid locates the abduction at Lake Pergus near Henna in Sicily. [Aphrodite](aphrodite.md) (Venus) instigated the abduction, commanding Cupid to shoot [Hades](hades.md) (Pluto) so he would seize Persephone and prevent her from remaining a virgin like [Athena](athena.md) and [Artemis](artemis.md). Persephone was gathering lilies and violets "in a pretty zeal to strive beyond all others" when "she was seen, beloved, and carried off by Pluto — such the haste of sudden love." As her robe tore in the struggle, her gathered flowers spilled: "This mishap, so perfect was her childish innocence, increased her virgin grief."[^met-pers-abduction]

The nymph Cyane tried to block Hades, declaring "thou shalt not by force alone become the son-in-law of Ceres." Hades hurled his scepter into the pool, splitting the earth, and plunged his chariot into [Tartarus](../places/tartarus.md).

### The Pomegranate Seeds (5.534-538)

The Fates barred Persephone's full return. "The virgin, thoughtless while she strayed among the cultivated Stygian fields, had broken fast. While there she plucked the fruit by bending a pomegranate tree, and plucked, and chewed seven grains, picked from the pallid rind."[^met-pers-seeds] Ascalaphus saw and testified, and was punished by being transformed into an owl.

### Queen of Two Kingdoms (5.564-571)

[Zeus](zeus.md) divided the year equally: "for six months with her mother she abides, and six months with her husband." Ovid emphasises her transformation: "Both her mind and her appearance quickly were transformed; for she who seemed so sad in Pluto's eyes" now showed a joyful face.[^met-pers-queen]

[^met-pers-abduction]: "she was seen, beloved, and carried off by Pluto—such the haste of sudden love. The goddess, in great fear, called on her mother and on all her friends; and, in her frenzy, as her robe was rent, down from the upper edge, her gathered flowers fell from her loosened tunic" (Metamorphoses 5.395-401, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-pers-seeds]: "The virgin, thoughtless while she strayed among the cultivated Stygian fields, had broken fast. While there she plucked the fruit by bending a pomegranate tree, and plucked, and chewed seven grains, picked from the pallid rind" (Metamorphoses 5.534-538, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-pers-queen]: "for six months with her mother she abides, and six months with her husband.—Both her mind and her appearance quickly were transformed" (Metamorphoses 5.566-568, trans. Brookes More)
