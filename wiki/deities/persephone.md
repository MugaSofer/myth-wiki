## The Abduction (Hymn to Demeter)

The [Homeric Hymn to Demeter](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) tells the full story of Persephone's abduction. She was "playing with the deep-bosomed daughters of [Oceanus](oceanus.md) and gathering flowers over a soft meadow, roses and crocuses and beautiful violets, irises also and hyacinths and the narcissus, which Earth made to grow at the will of [Zeus](zeus.md) and to please the Host of Many, to be a snare for the bloom-like girl."[^hd-flowers]

"The wide-pathed earth yawned there in the plain of Nysa, and the lord, Host of Many, with his immortal horses sprang out upon her... He caught her up reluctant on his golden car and bare her away lamenting."[^hd-seized]

### The Pomegranate

When [Zeus](zeus.md) sent [Hermes](hermes.md) to bring her back, [Hades](hades.md) told her to go but "secretly gave her sweet pomegranate seed to eat, taking care for himself that she might not remain continually with grave, dark-robed [Demeter](demeter.md)." Persephone later told her mother: "he secretly put in my mouth sweet food, a pomegranate seed, and forced me to taste against my will."[^hd-pomegranate]

### The Division of the Year

Because she had eaten in the underworld, Persephone must "go back again beneath the secret places of the earth, there to dwell a third part of the seasons every year: yet for the two parts" she would be with [Demeter](demeter.md) and the other gods.[^hd-division]

### Hecate

After her return, [Hecate](hecate.md) "often did she embrace the daughter of holy [Demeter](demeter.md): and from that time the lady Hecate was minister and companion to Persephone."[^hd-hecate]

### Hades's Promise

[Hades](hades.md) told Persephone before releasing her: "while you are here, you shall rule all that lives and moves and shall have the greatest rights among the deathless gods: those who defraud you and do not appease your power with offerings, reverently performing rites and paying fit gifts, shall be punished for evermore."[^hd-rule]

[^hd-flowers]: "she was playing with the deep-bosomed daughters of Oceanus and gathering flowers over a soft meadow, roses and crocuses and beautiful violets, irises also and hyacinths and the narcissus, which Earth made to grow at the will of Zeus and to please the Host of Many, to be a snare for the bloom-like girl" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 5-11, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^hd-seized]: "the wide-pathed earth yawned there in the plain of Nysa, and the lord, Host of Many, with his immortal horses sprang out upon her... He caught her up reluctant on his golden car and bare her away lamenting" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 16-20)
