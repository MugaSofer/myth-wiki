## In the Iliad

### Comforting Achilles (Book I)

When Achilles is dishonoured by Agamemnon, he weeps by the sea and his mother hears him "as she sate in the sea-depths beside her aged sire." She rises from the grey sea "like a mist" and asks: "My child, why weepest thou? What sorrow hath entered into thy heart?"[^il1-comfort]

Thetis laments her son's fate: "Ah me, my child, why reared I thee, cursed in my motherhood? Would thou hadst been left tearless and griefless amid the ships, seeing thy lot is very brief and endureth no long while; but now art thou made short-lived alike and lamentable beyond all men; in an evil hour I bare thee in our halls."[^il1-lament]

### Saving Zeus from Bondage

Achilles recalls how Thetis once saved [Zeus](zeus.md): "thou alone amid the immortals didst save the son of Kronos, lord of the storm-cloud, from shameful wreck, when all the other Olympians would have bound him, even [Hera](hera.md) and [Poseidon](poseidon.md) and Pallas [Athena](athena.md)." She summoned [Briareus](../creatures/hundred-handers.md) of the hundred arms to Olympus, "and the blessed gods feared him withal and bound not Zeus."[^il1-binding]

### Supplicating Zeus

Thetis travels to Olympus to beg [Zeus](zeus.md) to honour Achilles: "she sat before his face and with her left hand clasped his knees, and with her right touched him beneath his chin." She asks: "Father Zeus, if ever I gave thee aid amid the immortal gods, whether by word or deed, fulfil thou this my desire: do honour to my son, that is doomed to earliest death of all men."[^il1-supplicate]

[^il1-comfort]: "his lady mother heard him as she sate in the sea-depths beside her aged sire. With speed arose she from the grey sea, like a mist, and sate her before the face of her weeping son, and stroked him with her hand, and spake and called on his name: 'My child, why weepest thou? What sorrow hath entered into thy heart?'" (Iliad I.531-536)
[^il1-lament]: "Ah me, my child, why reared I thee, cursed in my motherhood? Would thou hadst been left tearless and griefless amid the ships, seeing thy lot is very brief and endureth no long while; but now art thou made short-lived alike and lamentable beyond all men; in an evil hour I bare thee in our halls" (Iliad I.584-589)
[^il1-binding]: "thou alone amid the immortals didst save the son of Kronos, lord of the storm-cloud, from shameful wreck, when all the other Olympians would have bound him, even Hera and Poseidon and Pallas Athene. Then didst thou, O goddess, enter in and loose him from his bonds, having with speed summoned to high Olympus him of the hundred arms whom gods call Briareus" (Iliad I.566-572)
[^il1-supplicate]: "she sat before his face and with her left hand clasped his knees, and with her right touched him beneath his chin, and spake in prayer to king Zeus son of Kronos: 'Father Zeus, if ever I gave thee aid amid the immortal gods, whether by word or deed, fulfil thou this my desire: do honour to my son, that is doomed to earliest death of all men'" (Iliad I.669-674)

### Achilles' Two Fates (Book IX)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book IX, Achilles reveals what Thetis has told him of his destiny: "my goddess mother telleth me, Thetis the silver-footed, that twain fates are bearing me to the issue of death. If I abide here and besiege the Trojans' city, then my returning home is taken from me, but my fame shall be imperishable; but if I go home to my dear native land, my high fame is taken from me, but my life shall endure long while, neither shall the issue of death soon reach me."[^il9-fates]

[^il9-fates]: "my goddess mother telleth me, Thetis the silver-footed, that twain fates are bearing me to the issue of death. If I abide here and besiege the Trojans' city, then my returning home is taken from me, but my fame shall be imperishable; but if I go home to my dear native land, my high fame is taken from me, but my life shall endure long while, neither shall the issue of death soon reach me" (Iliad IX.5301-5307, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

### Sheltering Dionysus (Book VI)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book VI, Diomedes recounts how when Lykurgos chased [Dionysus](dionysus.md) and his followers from Nysa, "Dionysos fled and plunged beneath the salt sea-wave, and Thetis took him to her bosom, affrighted, for a mighty trembling had seized him at his foe's rebuke."[^il6-dionysus]

This is the second instance of Thetis sheltering a god who falls or flees into the sea — [Hephaestus](hephaestus.md) being the first (Hymn III).

[^il6-dionysus]: "Dionysos fled and plunged beneath the salt sea-wave, and Thetis took him to her bosom, affrighted, for a mighty trembling had seized him at his foe's rebuke" (Iliad VI.3584-3586, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

### Lament and the Nereids (Book XVIII)

When Achilles learns of Patroklos's death, "terribly moaned Achilles; and his lady mother heard him as she sate in the depths of the sea beside her ancient sire. And thereon she uttered a cry, and the goddesses flocked around her, all the daughters of Nereus that were in the deep of the sea."[^il18-nereids]

Thetis leads the lament among the Nereids: "Listen, sister Nereids, that ye all hear and know well what sorrows are in my heart. Ay me unhappy, ay me that bare to my sorrow the first of men! For after I had borne a son noble and strong, the chief of heroes, and he shot up like a young branch, then when I had reared him as a plant in a very fruitful field I sent him in beaked ships to Ilios... but never again shall I welcome him back to his home."[^il18-lament]

She confirms his fate: "Short-lived, I ween, must thou be then, my child, by what thou sayest, for straightway after Hector is death appointed unto thee."[^il18-fate]

### Commissioning Armour from Hephaistos (Book XVIII)

Thetis goes to Olympus to commission new armour from [Hephaistos](hephaestus.md). She describes her forced marriage to Peleus: "He chose me from among the sisters of the sea to enthrall me to a man, even Peleus Aiakos' son, and with a man I endured wedlock sore against my will."[^il18-marriage]

[^il18-nereids]: "terribly moaned Achilles; and his lady mother heard him as she sate in the depths of the sea beside her ancient sire. And thereon she uttered a cry, and the goddesses flocked around her, all the daughters of Nereus that were in the deep of the sea" (Iliad XVIII.10482-10486, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il18-lament]: "Listen, sister Nereids, that ye all hear and know well what sorrows are in my heart. Ay me unhappy, ay me that bare to my sorrow the first of men! For after I had borne a son noble and strong, the chief of heroes, and he shot up like a young branch, then when I had reared him as a plant in a very fruitful field I sent him in beaked ships to Ilios to fight against the men of Troy; but never again shall I welcome him back to his home, to the house of Peleus" (Iliad XVIII.10487-10494)
[^il18-fate]: "Short-lived, I ween, must thou be then, my child, by what thou sayest, for straightway after Hector is death appointed unto thee" (Iliad XVIII.10527-10529)
[^il18-marriage]: "He chose me from among the sisters of the sea to enthrall me to a man, even Peleus Aiakos' son, and with a man I endured wedlock sore against my will" (Iliad XVIII.10737-10739)
