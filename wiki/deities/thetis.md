## In the Iliad

### Comforting Achilles (Book I)

When Achilles is dishonoured by Agamemnon, he weeps by the sea and his mother hears him "as she sate in the sea-depths beside her aged sire." She rises from the grey sea "like a mist" and asks: "My child, why weepest thou? What sorrow hath entered into thy heart?"[^il1-comfort]

Thetis laments her son's fate: "Ah me, my child, why reared I thee, cursed in my motherhood? Would thou hadst been left tearless and griefless amid the ships, seeing thy lot is very brief and endureth no long while; but now art thou made short-lived alike and lamentable beyond all men; in an evil hour I bare thee in our halls."[^il1-lament]

### Saving Zeus from Bondage

Achilles recalls how Thetis once saved [Zeus](zeus.md): "thou alone amid the immortals didst save the son of Kronos, lord of the storm-cloud, from shameful wreck, when all the other Olympians would have bound him, even [Hera](hera.md) and [Poseidon](poseidon.md) and Pallas [Athena](athena.md)." She summoned [Briareus](../creatures/hundred-handers.md) of the hundred arms to Olympus, "and the blessed gods feared him withal and bound not Zeus."[^il1-binding]

### Supplicating Zeus

Thetis travels to Olympus to beg [Zeus](zeus.md) to honour Achilles: "she sat before his face and with her left hand clasped his knees, and with her right touched him beneath his chin." She asks: "Father Zeus, if ever I gave thee aid amid the immortal gods, whether by word or deed, fulfil thou this my desire: do honour to my son, that is doomed to earliest death of all men."[^il1-supplicate]

[^il1-comfort]: "his lady mother heard him as she sate in the sea-depths beside her aged sire. With speed arose she from the grey sea, like a mist, and sate her before the face of her weeping son, and stroked him with her hand, and spake and called on his name: 'My child, why weepest thou? What sorrow hath entered into thy heart?'" (Iliad I.531-536)
[^il1-lament]: "Ah me, my child, why reared I thee, cursed in my motherhood? Would thou hadst been left tearless and griefless amid the ships, seeing thy lot is very brief and endureth no long while; but now art thou made short-lived alike and lamentable beyond all men; in an evil hour I bare thee in our halls" (Iliad I.584-589)
[^il1-binding]: "thou alone amid the immortals didst save the son of Kronos, lord of the storm-cloud, from shameful wreck, when all the other Olympians would have bound him, even Hera and Poseidon and Pallas Athene. Then didst thou, O goddess, enter in and loose him from his bonds, having with speed summoned to high Olympus him of the hundred arms whom gods call Briareus" (Iliad I.566-572)
[^il1-supplicate]: "she sat before his face and with her left hand clasped his knees, and with her right touched him beneath his chin, and spake in prayer to king Zeus son of Kronos: 'Father Zeus, if ever I gave thee aid amid the immortal gods, whether by word or deed, fulfil thou this my desire: do honour to my son, that is doomed to earliest death of all men'" (Iliad I.669-674)
