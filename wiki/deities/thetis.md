## In the Iliad

### Comforting Achilles (Book I)

When Achilles is dishonoured by Agamemnon, he weeps by the sea and his mother hears him "as she sate in the sea-depths beside her aged sire." She rises from the grey sea "like a mist" and asks: "My child, why weepest thou? What sorrow hath entered into thy heart?"[^il1-comfort]

Thetis laments her son's fate: "Ah me, my child, why reared I thee, cursed in my motherhood? Would thou hadst been left tearless and griefless amid the ships, seeing thy lot is very brief and endureth no long while; but now art thou made short-lived alike and lamentable beyond all men; in an evil hour I bare thee in our halls."[^il1-lament]

### Saving Zeus from Bondage

Achilles recalls how Thetis once saved [Zeus](zeus.md): "thou alone amid the immortals didst save the son of Kronos, lord of the storm-cloud, from shameful wreck, when all the other Olympians would have bound him, even [Hera](hera.md) and [Poseidon](poseidon.md) and Pallas [Athena](athena.md)." She summoned [Briareus](../creatures/hundred-handers.md) of the hundred arms to Olympus, "and the blessed gods feared him withal and bound not Zeus."[^il1-binding]

### Supplicating Zeus

Thetis travels to Olympus to beg [Zeus](zeus.md) to honour Achilles: "she sat before his face and with her left hand clasped his knees, and with her right touched him beneath his chin." She asks: "Father Zeus, if ever I gave thee aid amid the immortal gods, whether by word or deed, fulfil thou this my desire: do honour to my son, that is doomed to earliest death of all men."[^il1-supplicate]

[^il1-comfort]: "his lady mother heard him as she sate in the sea-depths beside her aged sire. With speed arose she from the grey sea, like a mist, and sate her before the face of her weeping son, and stroked him with her hand, and spake and called on his name: 'My child, why weepest thou? What sorrow hath entered into thy heart?'" (Iliad 1.355-360)
[^il1-lament]: "Ah me, my child, why reared I thee, cursed in my motherhood? Would thou hadst been left tearless and griefless amid the ships, seeing thy lot is very brief and endureth no long while; but now art thou made short-lived alike and lamentable beyond all men; in an evil hour I bare thee in our halls" (Iliad 1.410-415)
[^il1-binding]: "thou alone amid the immortals didst save the son of Kronos, lord of the storm-cloud, from shameful wreck, when all the other Olympians would have bound him, even Hera and Poseidon and Pallas Athene. Then didst thou, O goddess, enter in and loose him from his bonds, having with speed summoned to high Olympus him of the hundred arms whom gods call Briareus" (Iliad 1.391-397)
[^il1-supplicate]: "she sat before his face and with her left hand clasped his knees, and with her right touched him beneath his chin, and spake in prayer to king Zeus son of Kronos: 'Father Zeus, if ever I gave thee aid amid the immortal gods, whether by word or deed, fulfil thou this my desire: do honour to my son, that is doomed to earliest death of all men'" (Iliad 1.497-502)

### Achilles' Two Fates (Book IX)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book IX, Achilles reveals what Thetis has told him of his destiny: "my goddess mother telleth me, Thetis the silver-footed, that twain fates are bearing me to the issue of death. If I abide here and besiege the Trojans' city, then my returning home is taken from me, but my fame shall be imperishable; but if I go home to my dear native land, my high fame is taken from me, but my life shall endure long while, neither shall the issue of death soon reach me."[^il9-fates]

[^il9-fates]: "my goddess mother telleth me, Thetis the silver-footed, that twain fates are bearing me to the issue of death. If I abide here and besiege the Trojans' city, then my returning home is taken from me, but my fame shall be imperishable; but if I go home to my dear native land, my high fame is taken from me, but my life shall endure long while, neither shall the issue of death soon reach me" (Iliad 9.405-411, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

### Sheltering Dionysus (Book VI)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book VI, Diomedes recounts how when Lykurgos chased [Dionysus](dionysus.md) and his followers from Nysa, "Dionysos fled and plunged beneath the salt sea-wave, and Thetis took him to her bosom, affrighted, for a mighty trembling had seized him at his foe's rebuke."[^il6-dionysus]

This is the second instance of Thetis sheltering a god who falls or flees into the sea — [Hephaestus](hephaestus.md) being the first (Hymn III).

[^il6-dionysus]: "Dionysos fled and plunged beneath the salt sea-wave, and Thetis took him to her bosom, affrighted, for a mighty trembling had seized him at his foe's rebuke" (Iliad 6.136-138, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

### Lament and the Nereids (Book XVIII)

When Achilles learns of Patroklos's death, "terribly moaned Achilles; and his lady mother heard him as she sate in the depths of the sea beside her ancient sire. And thereon she uttered a cry, and the goddesses flocked around her, all the daughters of Nereus that were in the deep of the sea."[^il18-nereids]

Thetis leads the lament among the Nereids: "Listen, sister Nereids, that ye all hear and know well what sorrows are in my heart. Ay me unhappy, ay me that bare to my sorrow the first of men! For after I had borne a son noble and strong, the chief of heroes, and he shot up like a young branch, then when I had reared him as a plant in a very fruitful field I sent him in beaked ships to Ilios... but never again shall I welcome him back to his home."[^il18-lament]

She confirms his fate: "Short-lived, I ween, must thou be then, my child, by what thou sayest, for straightway after Hector is death appointed unto thee."[^il18-fate]

### Commissioning Armour from Hephaistos (Book XVIII)

Thetis goes to Olympus to commission new armour — including the [Shield of Achilles](../objects/shield-of-achilles.md) — from [Hephaistos](hephaestus.md). She describes her forced marriage to Peleus: "He chose me from among the sisters of the sea to enthrall me to a man, even Peleus Aiakos' son, and with a man I endured wedlock sore against my will."[^il18-marriage]

[^il18-nereids]: "terribly moaned Achilles; and his lady mother heard him as she sate in the depths of the sea beside her ancient sire. And thereon she uttered a cry, and the goddesses flocked around her, all the daughters of Nereus that were in the deep of the sea" (Iliad 18.49-54, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il18-lament]: "Listen, sister Nereids, that ye all hear and know well what sorrows are in my heart. Ay me unhappy, ay me that bare to my sorrow the first of men! For after I had borne a son noble and strong, the chief of heroes, and he shot up like a young branch, then when I had reared him as a plant in a very fruitful field I sent him in beaked ships to Ilios to fight against the men of Troy; but never again shall I welcome him back to his home, to the house of Peleus" (Iliad 18.56-65)
[^il18-fate]: "Short-lived, I ween, must thou be then, my child, by what thou sayest, for straightway after Hector is death appointed unto thee" (Iliad 18.109-111)
[^il18-marriage]: "He chose me from among the sisters of the sea to enthrall me to a man, even Peleus Aiakos' son, and with a man I endured wedlock sore against my will" (Iliad 18.387-389)

## In the Odyssey

### Achilles' Funeral (Odyssey Book XXIV)

In [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) Book XXIV, Agamemnon's shade describes Achilles' funeral to him in the underworld. Thetis emerged from the sea with her fellow sea-goddesses: "forth from the sea came thy mother with the deathless maidens of the waters, when they heard the tidings; and a wonderful wailing rose over the deep, and trembling fell on the limbs of all the Achaeans."[^od24-arrival]

The Nereids prepared his body: "Then round thee stood the daughters of the ancient one of the sea, holding a pitiful lament, and they clad thee about in raiment incorruptible."[^od24-nereids]

The [Muses](groups/muses.md) joined the mourning: "all the nine Muses one to the other replying with sweet voices began the dirge; there thou wouldest not have seen an Argive but wept, so mightily rose up the clear chant."[^od24-muses] The mourning lasted "seventeen days and nights continually did we all bewail thee, immortal gods and mortal men."[^od24-seventeen]

After the cremation — "when the flame of [Hephaestus](hephaestus.md) had utterly abolished thee" — Thetis provided the urn for Achilles' bones: "Thy mother gave a twy-handled golden urn, and said that it was the gift of [Dionysus](dionysus.md), and the workmanship of renowned [Hephaestus](hephaestus.md)."[^od24-urn]

Finally, Thetis organised funeral games: "Then thy mother asked the gods for glorious prizes in the games, and set them in the midst of the lists for the champions of the Achaeans... such glorious prizes did the goddess set there to honour thee, even Thetis, the silver-footed; for very dear wert thou to the gods."[^od24-games]

[^od24-arrival]: "forth from the sea came thy mother with the deathless maidens of the waters, when they heard the tidings; and a wonderful wailing rose over the deep, and trembling fell on the limbs of all the Achaeans" (Odyssey 24.54-57, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od24-nereids]: "Then round thee stood the daughters of the ancient one of the sea, holding a pitiful lament, and they clad thee about in raiment incorruptible" (Odyssey 24.67-69, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od24-muses]: "all the nine Muses one to the other replying with sweet voices began the dirge; there thou wouldest not have seen an Argive but wept, so mightily rose up the clear chant" (Odyssey 24.69-71, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od24-seventeen]: "seventeen days and nights continually did we all bewail thee, immortal gods and mortal men" (Odyssey 24.72-73, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od24-urn]: "Thy mother gave a twy-handled golden urn, and said that it was the gift of Dionysus, and the workmanship of renowned Hephaestus" (Odyssey 24.81-83, trans. Butcher and Lang)

Butcher and Lang)

## In the Hesiodic Fragments

### Avoiding Zeus (Catalogue of Women)

The Catalogue of Women confirms the tradition found also in the [Cypria](../sources/epic-cycle.md): "Thetis avoided wedlock with [Zeus](zeus.md) to please [Hera](hera.md); but that Zeus was angry and swore that she should mate with a mortal. Hesiod also has the like account."[^cat-thetis] The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) gives the theological reason more explicitly: [Themis](themis.md) prophesied that Thetis's son would be mightier than his father.

[^cat-thetis]: "the author of the Cypria says that Thetis avoided wedlock with Zeus to please Hera; but that Zeus was angry and swore that she should mate with a mortal. Hesiod also has the like account" (Catalogue of Women, Fragment 57, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

### Testing Her Children (Aegimius)

The Aegimius gives a striking variant of Thetis's attempt to immortalise her children — different from both the Bibliotheca's fire version and the later tradition of dipping in the Styx. "Thetis used to throw the children she had by Peleus into a cauldron of water, because she wished to learn where they were mortal." After many children perished, "Peleus was annoyed, and prevented her from throwing Achilles into the cauldron."[^aeg-cauldron]

[^aeg-cauldron]: "Thetis used to throw the children she had by Peleus into a cauldron of water, because she wished to learn where they were mortal... And that after many had perished Peleus was annoyed, and prevented her from throwing Achilles into the cauldron" (Aegimius, Fragment 2, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## In the Epic Cycle

### Marriage to Peleus (Cypria)

In the [Epic Cycle](../sources/epic-cycle.md)'s account, Thetis's marriage to a mortal arose from divine politics. "Thetis, to please [Hera](hera.md), avoided union with [Zeus](zeus.md), at which he was enraged and swore that she should be the wife of a mortal."[^cyp-thetis] This forced marriage stands as the origin of Achilles — and, indirectly, of the Trojan War itself, for at the wedding of Peleus and Thetis, [Strife](night.md) arrived and started the dispute between the goddesses that led to the Judgment of Paris.[^cyp-judgment]

[^cyp-thetis]: "Thetis, to please Hera, avoided union with Zeus, at which he was enraged and swore that she should be the wife of a mortal" (Cypria, Fragment 4, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^cyp-judgment]: Cypria, summary by Proclus: "Strife arrives while the gods are feasting at the marriage of Peleus and starts a dispute between Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite"

### Warning Achilles of Memnon (Aethiopis)

In the Aethiopis, Thetis warned Achilles about Memnon, son of [Eos](eos.md), who came to aid Troy wearing armour made by [Hephaestus](hephaestus.md).[^aeth-memnon]

[^aeth-memnon]: Aethiopis, summary by Proclus: "Memnon, the son of Eos, wearing armour made by Hephaestus, comes to help the Trojans... Thetis warns her son about him"

### After Achilles' Death (Aethiopis)

When Paris and [Apollo](apollo.md) killed Achilles, Thetis arrived "with the Muses and her sisters" to bewail him, then "catches away from the pyre and transports to the White Island."[^aeth-achilles]

[^aeth-achilles]: Aethiopis, summary by Proclus: "Thetis, arriving with the Muses and her sisters, bewails her son, whom she afterwards catches away from the pyre and transports to the White Island"

### Warning Neoptolemus (Returns)

In the Returns, Thetis warned Neoptolemus (Achilles' son), who heeded her counsel and journeyed overland rather than by sea.[^ret-neoptolemus]

[^ret-neoptolemus]: Returns, summary by Proclus: "Neoptolemus, warned by Thetis, journeys overland"

## In the [Argonautica](../sources/argonautica.md)

In Book IV, [Iris](iris.md) came to Thetis at [Hera](hera.md)'s bidding to summon her aid for the Argo's return past the Wandering Rocks. Within this episode Apollonius provides a backstory for the Thetis–Zeus–Peleus tradition: Zeus had once desired Thetis, but [Themis](themis.md) declared the truth — that her son would be mightier than his sire; Zeus therefore gave her up to a mortal husband, and Hera herself raised the bridal torch. Thetis had tried to make Achilles immortal by burning away his mortal element with fire and anointing him with ambrosia each night; Peleus, waking in the night and seeing his son gasping in the flame, cried out, and Thetis caught up the child, threw him to the ground, and herself like a breath of wind passed swiftly from the hall as a dream and leapt into the sea.[^arg-thetis-backstory]

To help the Argo through the Wandering Rocks — which rolled and crashed together even when birds tried to fly between them — Thetis set her hand to the rudder-blade and steered the ship. The Nereids gathered to help, passing the ship from hand to hand as maidens sport with a shapely-rounded ball, sending it high into the air that never touches the ground.[^arg-thetis-rocks]

[^arg-thetis-backstory]: "he ceased not from spying thee against thy will, until reverend Themis declared to him the whole truth, how that it was thy fate to bear a son mightier than his sire; wherefore he gave thee up... And with my own hand I raised the bridal torch, in return for the kindly honour thou didst pay me... Peleus leapt up from his bed and saw his dear son gasping in the flame; and at the sight he uttered a terrible cry, fool that he was; and she heard it, and catching up the child threw him screaming to the ground, and herself like a breath of wind passed swiftly from the hall as a dream and leapt into the sea, exceeding wroth" (Argonautica 4.800-809, trans. R.C. Seaton)
[^arg-thetis-rocks]: "lady Thetis set her hand to the rudder-blade, to guide them amid the Wandering rocks... the Nereids, even as maidens near some sandy beach roll their garments up to their waists out of their way and sport with a shapely-rounded ball; then they catch it one from another and send it high into the air; and it never touches the ground; so they in turn one from another sent the ship through the air over the waves" (Argonautica 4.950-960, trans. R.C. Seaton)

## In the Fabulae

### The Prophecy and Marriage to Peleus (§54)

The [Fabulae](../sources/hyginus.md) preserves a crucial variant on the Thetis tradition, centering on [Prometheus](../deities/prometheus.md)'s knowledge and his bargain with [Zeus](zeus.md).

"A prediction about Thetis, the Nereid, was that her son would be greater than his father."[^hyg-54-prophecy] This is the same prophecy known from the [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) and [Epic Cycle](../sources/epic-cycle.md), but Hyginus adds a significant detail: "Since no one but Prometheus knew this, and [Jove](zeus.md) wished to lie with her, Prometheus promised Jove that he would give him timely warning if he would free him from his chains."[^hyg-54-bargain]

This makes Prometheus's release conditional on revealing the secret. "And so when the promise was given he advised Jove not to lie with Thetis, for if one greater than he were born he might drive Jove from his kingdom, as he himself had done to Saturn."[^hyg-54-warning]

"And so Thetis was given in marriage to Peleus, son of Aeacus."[^hyg-54-marriage] This forced marriage to a mortal becomes the direct consequence of the prophecy.

The bargain is completed: "[Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) was sent to kill the eagle which was eating out Prometheus' heart. When it was killed, Prometheus after thirty thousand years was freed from Mount Caucasus."[^hyg-54-release] The specific detail of "thirty thousand years" appears nowhere else in the tradition and gives the duration of Prometheus's torment.

## In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md)

### Marriage to Peleus (11.221-265)

The Metamorphoses gives the fullest account of Thetis's resistance to [Peleus](../heroes/peleus.md). She is described as "the lovely daughter of the sea" with "green hair."[^met-th-desc] Proteus prophesied she would bear a son who would "surpass the deeds of his own father," so [Zeus](zeus.md) renounced her and urged Peleus to marry her instead.

Thetis would visit a myrtle cave, riding "quite naked, seated on her dolphin, which was harnessed."[^met-th-dolphin] When Peleus seized her, she transformed repeatedly — into a bird, a large tree, and a spotted tigress — but Peleus held fast. She finally yielded: "she groaned and said, 'You could not overcome me in this way, but some divinity has given you the power.'"[^met-th-yield]

[^met-th-desc]: "the lovely daughter of the sea" and "the green haired maid" (Metamorphoses 11.226-228, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-th-dolphin]: "There Thetis often went, quite naked, seated on her dolphin, which was harnessed" (Metamorphoses 11.236-237)
[^met-th-yield]: "she groaned and said, 'You could not overcome me in this way, but some divinity has given you the power.' Then she appeared as Thetis" (Metamorphoses 11.259-262)

## In [Pindar](../sources/pindar.md)

### Shapeshifting Resistance (Nemean IV)

Nemean IV alludes to Thetis's shapeshifting resistance to [Peleus](../heroes/peleus.md). Myers's footnote explains directly: "Thetis, resisting her wooer Peleus, changed herself into fire and wild beasts." The poem itself records what Peleus survived to win her: "having escaped the violence of the fire and the dauntless lion's claws exceeding keen, and the bitings of teeth most terrible."[^pin-nem4-shapes]

[^pin-nem4-shapes]: "having escaped the violence of the fire and the dauntless lion's claws exceeding keen, and the bitings of teeth most terrible" (Pindar, Nemean IV, trans. Ernest Myers) [Myers's footnote: "Thetis, resisting her wooer Peleus, changed herself into fire and wild beasts."]

### Zeus and Poseidon Rival for Her Hand (Isthmian VII)

Pindar's Isthmian VII gives the fullest account of the divine rivalry over Thetis and the prophecy that resolved it. "For the hand of Thetis there was strife between Zeus and glorious Poseidon, each having desire that she should be his fair bride, for love had obtained dominion over them."[^pin-ist7-rivalry]

The resolution came through prophecy: "Themis of wise counsels spake in the midst of them of how it was pre-destined that the sea-goddess should bear a royal offspring mightier than his father, whose hand should wield a bolt more terrible than the lightning or the dread trident, if she came ever into the bed of Zeus, or of brethren of Zeus."[^pin-ist7-themis]

[Themis](../deities/themis.md) then counselled the end of the rivalry: "'Cease ye herefrom: let her enter a mortal's couch and see her son fall in war, who shall be as Ares in the might of his hands, and as the lightning in the swiftness of his feet. My counsel is that ye give her to be the heaven-sent prize of Peleus son of Aiakos, whom the speech of men showeth to be their most righteous, an offspring of Iolkos' plain.'"[^pin-ist7-counsel]

On the timing of the wedding night: "on the evening of the mid-month moon shall she unbind for the hero the fair girdle of her virginity."[^pin-ist7-night]

[^pin-ist7-rivalry]: "for the hand of Thetis there was strife between Zeus and glorious Poseidon, each having desire that she should be his fair bride, for love had obtained dominion over them" (Pindar, Isthmian VII, trans. Ernest Myers)
[^pin-ist7-themis]: "Themis of wise counsels spake in the midst of them of how it was pre-destined that the sea-goddess should bear a royal offspring mightier than his father, whose hand should wield a bolt more terrible than the lightning or the dread trident, if she came ever into the bed of Zeus, or of brethren of Zeus" (Pindar, Isthmian VII)

[^pin-ist7-night]: "on the evening of the mid-month moon shall she unbind for the hero the fair girdle of her virginity" (Pindar, Isthmian VII)

## In the [Achilleid](../sources/achilleid.md)

The Achilleid gives Thetis her most sustained characterisation — as a mother consumed by fear, whose every stratagem fails against fate.

### The Styx and the Plea to Neptune

Thetis is the only source to explicitly describe dipping Achilles in the [Styx](styx.md). She alludes to it while persuading him to accept his disguise: "if at thy birth I fortified thee with the stern waters of Styx — ay, would I had wholly!"[^ach-styx] The "would I had wholly" implies the incomplete protection — one part of his body left vulnerable.

When she sees Paris's fleet, she panics and begs [Poseidon](poseidon.md) to sink the ships. He refuses: the war is fated. But he promises her revenge on the Greek return voyage.[^ach-neptune]

### Cunning and Deception

Unable to prevent the war, Thetis resorts to deception. She goes to [Chiron](../creatures/chiron.md)'s cave and lies — claiming she needs Achilles for a purification rite. She dares not "confess to the old man the soft raiment and dishonourable garb."[^ach-lie] She then carries the sleeping boy by dolphin-chariot across the night sea to [Scyros](../places/scyros.md), where she disguises him as a maiden and presents "her daughter" to King Lycomedes.[^ach-disguise]

Her prayer as she departs is poignant: "O land that I love, to whom by timid cunning I have committed the pledge of my anxious care... mayst thou prosper and be silent, I beg, as Crete was silent for [Rhea](rhea.md)."[^ach-prayer]

[^ach-styx]: "if at thy birth I fortified thee with the stern waters of Styx — ay, would I had wholly!" (Achilleid 1.269-270, trans. J.H. Mozley)
[^ach-neptune]: "'Tis the sure ordinance of heaven that Europe and Asia should join in bloody conflict" (Achilleid 1.80-83)
[^ach-lie]: "nor would he have given him up, had she dared to confess to the old man the soft raiment and dishonourable garb" (Achilleid 1.141-142)
[^ach-disguise]: Achilleid 1.242-396. Thetis disguises Achilles and presents him to Lycomedes.
[^ach-prayer]: "O land that I love, to whom by timid cunning I have committed the pledge of my anxious care... mayst thou prosper and be silent, I beg, as Crete was silent for Rhea" (Achilleid 1.384-388)

## In the Posthomerica

### Lament and Arrival at Troy (Book III)

When Achilles fell to Apollo's arrow, the sound of mourning reached Thetis in the sea depths. She and the Nereids came rushing up "with dark mantles overpalled... with one wild cry they floated up; it rang, a sound as when fleet-flying cranes forebode a great storm."[^post3-arrival] The Muses came from Helicon to join them, drawn "for love and honour to the Nereid starry-eyed."[^post3-muses]

Thetis cast herself onto Achilles' body, kissed him, and poured out her grief — blaming Zeus for the bargain he had struck with her: "Zeus promised me to make him glorious in the Aeacid halls, in recompense for the bridal I so loathed that into wild wind now I changed me, now to water, now in fashion as a bird I was, now as the blast of flame; nor might a mortal win me for his bride... until the Olympian pledged him to bestow a godlike son on me, a lord of war."[^post3-lament] She declared her intent to ascend to Zeus and challenge him for his broken promises and for having given her, unwilling, to a mortal husband whose old age had already come.

[Calliope](../deities/groups/muses.md) consoled her: "From lamentation, Thetis, now forbear... even sons of Zeus, the Thunder-king, have perished, overborne by evil fate. Immortal though I be, mine own son Orpheus died... for to the sons of earth minstrels shall chant his glory and his might, by mine and by my sisters' inspiration, unto the end of time."[^post3-calliope] Thetis remained wakeful through the night by the sea, while the Muses spoke comforting words to her.

[^post3-arrival]: "with dark mantles overpalled they sped swiftly to where the Argive men were thronged... With one wild cry they floated up; it rang, a sound as when fleet-flying cranes forebode a great storm" (Posthomerica 3.2977-2984, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post3-muses]: "Swiftly from Helicon the Muses came heart-burdened with undying grief, for love and honour to the Nereid starry-eyed" (Posthomerica 3.2987-2989, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post3-lament]: "Zeus promised me to make him glorious in the Aeacid halls, in recompense for the bridal I so loathed that into wild wind now I changed me, now to water, now in fashion as a bird I was, now as the blast of flame; nor might a mortal win me for his bride, who seemed all shapes in turn that earth and heaven contain, until the Olympian pledged him to bestow a godlike son on me, a lord of war" (Posthomerica 3.3017-3025, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post3-calliope]: "From lamentation, Thetis, now forbear, and do not, in the frenzy of thy grief for thy lost son, provoke to wrath the Lord of Gods and men... for to the sons of earth minstrels shall chant his glory and his might, by mine and by my sisters' inspiration, unto the end of time" (Posthomerica 3.3038-3053, trans. A.S. Way)

### Snatching Achilles from the Pyre (Book III)

After many days of mourning, the Argives built a great pyre and burned Achilles' body. Athena, who "pitied him, and showered upon his head ambrosia," had preserved the body before cremation, giving it "a stern frown, even as when he lay, with wrath darkening his grim face, clasping his slain friend Patroclus; and she made his frame to be more massive, like a war-god to behold."[^post3-athena] During the cremation, Zeus sent the winds at Thetis's behest to speed the pyre, and the Nereids shed ambrosia and precious nards over the gathered bones.[^post3-bones]

Thetis provided the golden vase to hold Achilles' bones: "A golden vase his mother gave, the gift in old time of the Wine-god, glorious work of the craft-master Fire-god."[^post3-urn]

Poseidon then appeared among the Nereids and spoke consolation directly to Thetis: "Refrain from endless mourning for thy son. Not with the dead shall he abide, but dwell with Gods, as doth the might of Herakles, and Dionysus ever fair... To the light of Zeus soon shall he rise; and I will give to him a holy island for my gift: it lies within the Euxine Sea: there evermore a God thy son shall be."[^post3-poseidon] The narrators confirms: "a little in her breast revived the spirit of Thetis: and the God brought this to pass thereafter."[^post3-revived]

[^post3-athena]: "The Trito-born, the passing-wise, beheld and pitied him, and showered upon his head ambrosia... She made him: over that dead face she drew a stern frown, even as when he lay, with wrath darkening his grim face, clasping his slain friend Patroclus; and she made his frame to be more massive, like a war-god to behold" (Posthomerica 3.2914-2923, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post3-bones]: "Nereus' daughters shed ambrosia over them, and precious nards for honour to Achilles" (Posthomerica 3.3161-3163, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post3-urn]: "A golden vase his mother gave, the gift in old time of the Wine-god, glorious work of the craft-master Fire-god, in the which they laid the casket that enclosed the bones of mighty-souled Achilles" (Posthomerica 3.3165-3169, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post3-poseidon]: "Refrain from endless mourning for thy son. Not with the dead shall he abide, but dwell with Gods, as doth the might of Herakles, and Dionysus ever fair. Not him dread doom shall prison in darkness evermore, nor Hades keep him. To the light of Zeus soon shall he rise; and I will give to him a holy island for my gift: it lies within the Euxine Sea: there evermore a God thy son shall be. The tribes that dwell around shall as mine own self honour him with incense and with steam of sacrifice" (Posthomerica 3.3208-3220, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post3-revived]: "a little in her breast revived the spirit of Thetis: and the God brought this to pass thereafter" (Posthomerica 3.3224-3226, trans. A.S. Way)

### Funeral Games for Achilles (Book IV)

At the funeral games, Thetis arrived from the sea "like the still breath of dawn, and suddenly was with the Argive throng."[^post4-arrival] She set out the prizes and summoned the Achaean champions. When Nestor sang her praises — singing "how she in willsomeness of beauty was of all the Sea-maids chief," and then sang the bridal of Peleus and "the ambrosial feast when the swift Hours brought in immortal hands meats not of earth" — she "well-pleased... hearkened," and rewarded him.[^post4-nestor]

She awarded prizes throughout the games: fleet-footed horses (Telephus's gift to Achilles) to Nestor; kine for the footrace; captive handmaids from Lesbos to Ajax and Diomedes; a chariot with horses to Idomeneus; silver bowls to Epeius and Acamas; Memnon's armour to Ajax for the iron-bar throw; Cycnus's battle-gear to Agapenor for the leaping contest; a silver oil-flask to Euryalus for the javelin cast; two silver talents to Ajax (uncontested) for fighting; Eetion's golden cup to Menelaus for the chariot race; and prizes to all the riders. "His stately height called to her mind her dear son, and she sighed."[^post4-sigh]

[^post4-arrival]: "the Bride of Peleus gliding came forth of the sea, like the still breath of dawn, and suddenly was with the Argive throng" (Posthomerica 4.3377-3380, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post4-nestor]: "he sang once more... how she in willsomeness of beauty was of all the Sea-maids chief. Well-pleased she hearkened" (Posthomerica 4.3398-3402, trans. A.S. Way)
[^post4-sigh]: "His stately height called to her mind her dear son, and she sighed" (Posthomerica 4.3823-3824, trans. A.S. Way)

### Guiding Neoptolemus to Troy (Book VII)

When Neoptolemus departed from Scyros, "Thetis and the Nereids joyed thereat," glad to see Achilles' son coming to Troy.[^post7-joy]

[^post7-joy]: "Thetis and the Nereids joyed thereat" (Posthomerica 7.5934, trans. A.S. Way)

### Speeding the Fleet at the Sack (Book XIII)

During the sack of Troy, when the Greek fleet sailed from Tenedos to Troy's shore, "Thetis made their paths straight, and behind them sent a driving wind speeding them, and the hearts Achaean glowed."[^post13-fleet]

[^post13-fleet]: "Thetis made their paths straight, and behind them sent a driving wind speeding them, and the hearts Achaean glowed" (Posthomerica 13.9452-9454, trans. A.S. Way)

## In Euripides' [Andromache](../sources/euripides-andromache.md)

Thetis appears as deus ex machina at the end of the play. She commands that [Neoptolemus](../heroes/neoptolemus.md) be buried at [Delphi](../places/delphi.md), "so shall his tomb declare the murderous violence [Orestes](../heroes/orestes.md)' band committed."[^eur-andr-th-burial] She prophesies that [Andromache](../heroes/andromache.md) must marry [Helenus](../heroes/helenus.md) and settle in Molossia, where Molossus will found a dynasty: "from him in long succession shall a race of happy kings Molossia's sceptre wield."[^eur-andr-th-molossus]

She promises [Peleus](../heroes/peleus.md) immortality: she will make him a god and take him to [Nereus](nereus.md)'s underwater palace, where he will see [Achilles](../heroes/achilles.md) "inhabiting that isle whose chalky coasts are laved by the surrounding Euxine deep" — the White Island, Leuke.[^eur-andr-th-peleus]
