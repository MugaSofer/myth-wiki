## In the Iliad

### Comforting Achilles (Book I)

When Achilles is dishonoured by Agamemnon, he weeps by the sea and his mother hears him "as she sate in the sea-depths beside her aged sire." She rises from the grey sea "like a mist" and asks: "My child, why weepest thou? What sorrow hath entered into thy heart?"[^il1-comfort]

Thetis laments her son's fate: "Ah me, my child, why reared I thee, cursed in my motherhood? Would thou hadst been left tearless and griefless amid the ships, seeing thy lot is very brief and endureth no long while; but now art thou made short-lived alike and lamentable beyond all men; in an evil hour I bare thee in our halls."[^il1-lament]

### Saving Zeus from Bondage

Achilles recalls how Thetis once saved [Zeus](zeus.md): "thou alone amid the immortals didst save the son of Kronos, lord of the storm-cloud, from shameful wreck, when all the other Olympians would have bound him, even [Hera](hera.md) and [Poseidon](poseidon.md) and Pallas [Athena](athena.md)." She summoned [Briareus](../creatures/hundred-handers.md) of the hundred arms to Olympus, "and the blessed gods feared him withal and bound not Zeus."[^il1-binding]

### Supplicating Zeus

Thetis travels to Olympus to beg [Zeus](zeus.md) to honour Achilles: "she sat before his face and with her left hand clasped his knees, and with her right touched him beneath his chin." She asks: "Father Zeus, if ever I gave thee aid amid the immortal gods, whether by word or deed, fulfil thou this my desire: do honour to my son, that is doomed to earliest death of all men."[^il1-supplicate]

[^il1-comfort]: "his lady mother heard him as she sate in the sea-depths beside her aged sire. With speed arose she from the grey sea, like a mist, and sate her before the face of her weeping son, and stroked him with her hand, and spake and called on his name: 'My child, why weepest thou? What sorrow hath entered into thy heart?'" (Iliad I.531-536)
[^il1-lament]: "Ah me, my child, why reared I thee, cursed in my motherhood? Would thou hadst been left tearless and griefless amid the ships, seeing thy lot is very brief and endureth no long while; but now art thou made short-lived alike and lamentable beyond all men; in an evil hour I bare thee in our halls" (Iliad I.584-589)
[^il1-binding]: "thou alone amid the immortals didst save the son of Kronos, lord of the storm-cloud, from shameful wreck, when all the other Olympians would have bound him, even Hera and Poseidon and Pallas Athene. Then didst thou, O goddess, enter in and loose him from his bonds, having with speed summoned to high Olympus him of the hundred arms whom gods call Briareus" (Iliad I.566-572)
[^il1-supplicate]: "she sat before his face and with her left hand clasped his knees, and with her right touched him beneath his chin, and spake in prayer to king Zeus son of Kronos: 'Father Zeus, if ever I gave thee aid amid the immortal gods, whether by word or deed, fulfil thou this my desire: do honour to my son, that is doomed to earliest death of all men'" (Iliad I.669-674)

### Achilles' Two Fates (Book IX)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book IX, Achilles reveals what Thetis has told him of his destiny: "my goddess mother telleth me, Thetis the silver-footed, that twain fates are bearing me to the issue of death. If I abide here and besiege the Trojans' city, then my returning home is taken from me, but my fame shall be imperishable; but if I go home to my dear native land, my high fame is taken from me, but my life shall endure long while, neither shall the issue of death soon reach me."[^il9-fates]

[^il9-fates]: "my goddess mother telleth me, Thetis the silver-footed, that twain fates are bearing me to the issue of death. If I abide here and besiege the Trojans' city, then my returning home is taken from me, but my fame shall be imperishable; but if I go home to my dear native land, my high fame is taken from me, but my life shall endure long while, neither shall the issue of death soon reach me" (Iliad IX.5301-5307, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

### Sheltering Dionysus (Book VI)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book VI, Diomedes recounts how when Lykurgos chased [Dionysus](dionysus.md) and his followers from Nysa, "Dionysos fled and plunged beneath the salt sea-wave, and Thetis took him to her bosom, affrighted, for a mighty trembling had seized him at his foe's rebuke."[^il6-dionysus]

This is the second instance of Thetis sheltering a god who falls or flees into the sea — [Hephaestus](hephaestus.md) being the first (Hymn III).

[^il6-dionysus]: "Dionysos fled and plunged beneath the salt sea-wave, and Thetis took him to her bosom, affrighted, for a mighty trembling had seized him at his foe's rebuke" (Iliad VI.3584-3586, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

### Lament and the Nereids (Book XVIII)

When Achilles learns of Patroklos's death, "terribly moaned Achilles; and his lady mother heard him as she sate in the depths of the sea beside her ancient sire. And thereon she uttered a cry, and the goddesses flocked around her, all the daughters of Nereus that were in the deep of the sea."[^il18-nereids]

Thetis leads the lament among the Nereids: "Listen, sister Nereids, that ye all hear and know well what sorrows are in my heart. Ay me unhappy, ay me that bare to my sorrow the first of men! For after I had borne a son noble and strong, the chief of heroes, and he shot up like a young branch, then when I had reared him as a plant in a very fruitful field I sent him in beaked ships to Ilios... but never again shall I welcome him back to his home."[^il18-lament]

She confirms his fate: "Short-lived, I ween, must thou be then, my child, by what thou sayest, for straightway after Hector is death appointed unto thee."[^il18-fate]

### Commissioning Armour from Hephaistos (Book XVIII)

Thetis goes to Olympus to commission new armour — including the [Shield of Achilles](../objects/shield-of-achilles.md) — from [Hephaistos](hephaestus.md). She describes her forced marriage to Peleus: "He chose me from among the sisters of the sea to enthrall me to a man, even Peleus Aiakos' son, and with a man I endured wedlock sore against my will."[^il18-marriage]

[^il18-nereids]: "terribly moaned Achilles; and his lady mother heard him as she sate in the depths of the sea beside her ancient sire. And thereon she uttered a cry, and the goddesses flocked around her, all the daughters of Nereus that were in the deep of the sea" (Iliad XVIII.10482-10486, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il18-lament]: "Listen, sister Nereids, that ye all hear and know well what sorrows are in my heart. Ay me unhappy, ay me that bare to my sorrow the first of men! For after I had borne a son noble and strong, the chief of heroes, and he shot up like a young branch, then when I had reared him as a plant in a very fruitful field I sent him in beaked ships to Ilios to fight against the men of Troy; but never again shall I welcome him back to his home, to the house of Peleus" (Iliad XVIII.10487-10494)
[^il18-fate]: "Short-lived, I ween, must thou be then, my child, by what thou sayest, for straightway after Hector is death appointed unto thee" (Iliad XVIII.10527-10529)
[^il18-marriage]: "He chose me from among the sisters of the sea to enthrall me to a man, even Peleus Aiakos' son, and with a man I endured wedlock sore against my will" (Iliad XVIII.10737-10739)

## In the Odyssey

### Achilles' Funeral (Odyssey Book XXIV)

In [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) Book XXIV, Agamemnon's shade describes Achilles' funeral to him in the underworld. Thetis emerged from the sea with her fellow sea-goddesses: "forth from the sea came thy mother with the deathless maidens of the waters, when they heard the tidings; and a wonderful wailing rose over the deep, and trembling fell on the limbs of all the Achaeans."[^od24-arrival]

The Nereids prepared his body: "Then round thee stood the daughters of the ancient one of the sea, holding a pitiful lament, and they clad thee about in raiment incorruptible."[^od24-nereids]

The [Muses](muses.md) joined the mourning: "all the nine Muses one to the other replying with sweet voices began the dirge; there thou wouldest not have seen an Argive but wept, so mightily rose up the clear chant."[^od24-muses] The mourning lasted "seventeen days and nights continually did we all bewail thee, immortal gods and mortal men."[^od24-seventeen]

After the cremation — "when the flame of [Hephaestus](hephaestus.md) had utterly abolished thee" — Thetis provided the urn for Achilles' bones: "Thy mother gave a twy-handled golden urn, and said that it was the gift of [Dionysus](dionysus.md), and the workmanship of renowned [Hephaestus](hephaestus.md)."[^od24-urn]

Finally, Thetis organised funeral games: "Then thy mother asked the gods for glorious prizes in the games, and set them in the midst of the lists for the champions of the Achaeans... such glorious prizes did the goddess set there to honour thee, even Thetis, the silver-footed; for very dear wert thou to the gods."[^od24-games]

[^od24-arrival]: "forth from the sea came thy mother with the deathless maidens of the waters, when they heard the tidings; and a wonderful wailing rose over the deep, and trembling fell on the limbs of all the Achaeans" (Odyssey XXIV.12600-12603, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od24-nereids]: "Then round thee stood the daughters of the ancient one of the sea, holding a pitiful lament, and they clad thee about in raiment incorruptible" (Odyssey XXIV.12613-12615, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od24-muses]: "all the nine Muses one to the other replying with sweet voices began the dirge; there thou wouldest not have seen an Argive but wept, so mightily rose up the clear chant" (Odyssey XXIV.12615-12617, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od24-seventeen]: "seventeen days and nights continually did we all bewail thee, immortal gods and mortal men" (Odyssey XXIV.12618-12619, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od24-urn]: "Thy mother gave a twy-handled golden urn, and said that it was the gift of Dionysus, and the workmanship of renowned Hephaestus" (Odyssey XXIV.12627-12629, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od24-games]: "Then thy mother asked the gods for glorious prizes in the games, and set them in the midst of the lists for the champions of the Achaeans... such glorious prizes did the goddess set there to honour thee, even Thetis, the silver-footed; for very dear wert thou to the gods" (Odyssey XXIV.12636-12643, trans. Butcher and Lang)

## In the Hesiodic Fragments

### Avoiding Zeus (Catalogue of Women)

The Catalogue of Women confirms the tradition found also in the [Cypria](../sources/epic-cycle.md): "Thetis avoided wedlock with [Zeus](zeus.md) to please [Hera](hera.md); but that Zeus was angry and swore that she should mate with a mortal. Hesiod also has the like account."[^cat-thetis] The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) gives the theological reason more explicitly: [Themis](themis.md) prophesied that Thetis's son would be mightier than his father.

[^cat-thetis]: "the author of the Cypria says that Thetis avoided wedlock with Zeus to please Hera; but that Zeus was angry and swore that she should mate with a mortal. Hesiod also has the like account" (Catalogue of Women, Fragment 57, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

### Testing Her Children (Aegimius)

The Aegimius gives a striking variant of Thetis's attempt to immortalise her children — different from both the Bibliotheca's fire version and the later tradition of dipping in the Styx. "Thetis used to throw the children she had by Peleus into a cauldron of water, because she wished to learn where they were mortal." After many children perished, "Peleus was annoyed, and prevented her from throwing Achilles into the cauldron."[^aeg-cauldron]

[^aeg-cauldron]: "Thetis used to throw the children she had by Peleus into a cauldron of water, because she wished to learn where they were mortal... And that after many had perished Peleus was annoyed, and prevented her from throwing Achilles into the cauldron" (Aegimius, Fragment 2, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## In the Epic Cycle

### Marriage to Peleus (Cypria)

In the [Epic Cycle](../sources/epic-cycle.md)'s account, Thetis's marriage to a mortal arose from divine politics. "Thetis, to please [Hera](hera.md), avoided union with [Zeus](zeus.md), at which he was enraged and swore that she should be the wife of a mortal."[^cyp-thetis] This forced marriage stands as the origin of Achilles — and, indirectly, of the Trojan War itself, for at the wedding of Peleus and Thetis, [Strife](night.md) arrived and started the dispute between the goddesses that led to the Judgment of Paris.[^cyp-judgment]

[^cyp-thetis]: "Thetis, to please Hera, avoided union with Zeus, at which he was enraged and swore that she should be the wife of a mortal" (Cypria, Fragment 4, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^cyp-judgment]: Cypria, summary by Proclus: "Strife arrives while the gods are feasting at the marriage of Peleus and starts a dispute between Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite"

### Warning Achilles of Memnon (Aethiopis)

In the Aethiopis, Thetis warned Achilles about Memnon, son of [Eos](eos.md), who came to aid Troy wearing armour made by [Hephaestus](hephaestus.md).[^aeth-memnon]

[^aeth-memnon]: Aethiopis, summary by Proclus: "Memnon, the son of Eos, wearing armour made by Hephaestus, comes to help the Trojans... Thetis warns her son about him"

### After Achilles' Death (Aethiopis)

When Paris and [Apollo](apollo.md) killed Achilles, Thetis arrived "with the Muses and her sisters" to bewail him, then "catches away from the pyre and transports to the White Island."[^aeth-achilles]

[^aeth-achilles]: Aethiopis, summary by Proclus: "Thetis, arriving with the Muses and her sisters, bewails her son, whom she afterwards catches away from the pyre and transports to the White Island"

### Warning Neoptolemus (Returns)

In the Returns, Thetis warned Neoptolemus (Achilles' son), who heeded her counsel and journeyed overland rather than by sea.[^ret-neoptolemus]

[^ret-neoptolemus]: Returns, summary by Proclus: "Neoptolemus, warned by Thetis, journeys overland"

## In the Fabulae

### The Prophecy and Marriage to Peleus (§54)

The [Fabulae](../sources/hyginus.md) preserves a crucial variant on the Thetis tradition, centering on [Prometheus](../titans/prometheus.md)'s knowledge and his bargain with [Zeus](zeus.md).

"A prediction about Thetis, the Nereid, was that her son would be greater than his father."[^hyg-54-prophecy] This is the same prophecy known from the [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) and [Epic Cycle](../sources/epic-cycle.md), but Hyginus adds a significant detail: "Since no one but Prometheus knew this, and [Jove](zeus.md) wished to lie with her, Prometheus promised Jove that he would give him timely warning if he would free him from his chains."[^hyg-54-bargain]

This makes Prometheus's release conditional on revealing the secret. "And so when the promise was given he advised Jove not to lie with Thetis, for if one greater than he were born he might drive Jove from his kingdom, as he himself had done to Saturn."[^hyg-54-warning]

"And so Thetis was given in marriage to Peleus, son of Aeacus."[^hyg-54-marriage] This forced marriage to a mortal becomes the direct consequence of the prophecy.

The bargain is completed: "[Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) was sent to kill the eagle which was eating out Prometheus' heart. When it was killed, Prometheus after thirty thousand years was freed from Mount Caucasus."[^hyg-54-release] The specific detail of "thirty thousand years" appears nowhere else in the tradition and gives the duration of Prometheus's torment.

## In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md)

### Marriage to Peleus (11.221-265)

The Metamorphoses gives the fullest account of Thetis's resistance to [Peleus](../heroes/peleus.md). She is described as "the lovely daughter of the sea" with "green hair."[^met-th-desc] Proteus prophesied she would bear a son who would "surpass the deeds of his own father," so [Zeus](zeus.md) renounced her and urged Peleus to marry her instead.

Thetis would visit a myrtle cave, riding "quite naked, seated on her dolphin, which was harnessed."[^met-th-dolphin] When Peleus seized her, she transformed repeatedly — into a bird, a large tree, and a spotted tigress — but Peleus held fast. She finally yielded: "she groaned and said, 'You could not overcome me in this way, but some divinity has given you the power.'"[^met-th-yield]

[^met-th-desc]: "the lovely daughter of the sea" and "the green haired maid" (Metamorphoses 11.226-228, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-th-dolphin]: "There Thetis often went, quite naked, seated on her dolphin, which was harnessed" (Metamorphoses 11.236-237)
[^met-th-yield]: "she groaned and said, 'You could not overcome me in this way, but some divinity has given you the power.' Then she appeared as Thetis" (Metamorphoses 11.259-262)
