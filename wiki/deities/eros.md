## Overview

**Eros** (Love) is a primordial deity who arose at the beginning of creation, alongside [Earth](gaia.md) and [Tartarus](../places/tartarus.md), shortly after [Chaos](chaos.md).

## Description

Eros is described as "fairest among the deathless gods, who unnerves the limbs and overcomes the mind and wise counsels of all gods and all men within them."[^theog-eros]

[^theog-eros]: "Eros (Love), fairest among the deathless gods, who unnerves the limbs and overcomes the mind and wise counsels of all gods and all men within them" (Theogony 120-122, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## In the [Argonautica](../sources/argonautica.md)

The Argonautica presents a radically different Eros from the Hesiodic primordial force: here he is [Aphrodite](aphrodite.md)'s small, mischievous son, a divine child who plays dice in Zeus's orchard and must be bribed to cooperate.

### Shooting Medea

When [Hera](hera.md) and [Athena](athena.md) visited [Aphrodite](aphrodite.md) in Book III, they found Eros in Zeus's orchard, "playing for golden dice" with Ganymede, cheating and winning: "already greedy Eros was holding the palm of his left hand quite full of them under his breast, standing upright; and on the bloom of his cheeks a sweet blush was glowing."[^arg3-dice] Aphrodite offered him Zeus's golden ball as a bribe — "Zeus' all-beauteous plaything — the one which his dear nurse Adrasteia made for him, while he still lived a child, with childish ways, in the Idaean cave — a well-rounded ball; no better toy wilt thou get from the hands of [Hephaestus](hephaestus.md)."[^arg3-bribe] In exchange, Eros was to shoot [Medea](../heroes/medea.md) with an arrow.

Eros flew to Colchis and shot the arrow from beneath the lintel of the hall: "quickly beneath the lintel in the porch he strung his bow and took from the quiver an arrow unshot before, messenger of pain."[^arg3-shot] The effect was immediate: "the bolt burnt deep down in the maiden's heart like a flame." Having accomplished his task, "the god himself flashed back again from the high-roofed hall, laughing loud."[^arg3-laugh]

[^arg3-dice]: "they were playing for golden dice, as boys in one house are wont to do. And already greedy Eros was holding the palm of his left hand quite full of them under his breast, standing upright; and on the bloom of his cheeks a sweet blush was glowing" (Argonautica 3.120-123, trans. R.C. Seaton)
[^arg3-bribe]: "I will give thee Zeus' all-beauteous plaything — the one which his dear nurse Adrasteia made for him, while he still lived a child, with childish ways, in the Idaean cave — a well-rounded ball; no better toy wilt thou get from the hands of Hephaestus" (Argonautica 3.133-137)
[^arg3-shot]: "quickly beneath the lintel in the porch he strung his bow and took from the quiver an arrow unshot before, messenger of pain... and the bolt burnt deep down in the maiden's heart like a flame" (Argonautica 3.277-285)
[^arg3-laugh]: "the god himself flashed back again from the high-roofed hall, laughing loud" (Argonautica 3.284-285)

## Appearances

- **[Theogony](../sources/theogony.md)** 120-122: Origin and description as primordial cosmic force
- **[Argonautica](../sources/argonautica.md)** III: Playing for golden dice with Ganymede in Zeus's orchard; bribed by [Aphrodite](aphrodite.md) with Zeus's golden ball; shot [Medea](../heroes/medea.md) beneath the hall's lintel with "an arrow unshot before, messenger of pain"; the bolt "burnt deep down in the maiden's heart like a flame"; "flashed back again from the high-roofed hall, laughing loud"

## Notes

The Theogony presents Eros as one of the very first beings, a primordial cosmic force that predates the gods. The Argonautica's Eros — a childish, cheating, bribable son of Aphrodite — represents a very different tradition. These are effectively two separate figures who share a name.
