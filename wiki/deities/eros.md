## Overview

**Eros** (Love) is a primordial deity who arose at the beginning of creation, alongside [Earth](gaia.md) and [Tartarus](../places/tartarus.md), shortly after [Chaos](chaos.md).

## Description

Eros is described as "fairest among the deathless gods, who unnerves the limbs and overcomes the mind and wise counsels of all gods and all men within them."[^theog-eros]

[^theog-eros]: "Eros (Love), fairest among the deathless gods, who unnerves the limbs and overcomes the mind and wise counsels of all gods and all men within them" (Theogony 120-122, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## In the [Argonautica](../sources/argonautica.md)

The Argonautica presents a radically different Eros from the Hesiodic primordial force: here he is [Aphrodite](aphrodite.md)'s small, mischievous son, a divine child who plays dice in Zeus's orchard and must be bribed to cooperate.

### Shooting Medea

When [Hera](hera.md) and [Athena](athena.md) visited Aphrodite in Book III, they found Eros absent — he was in Zeus's orchard, playing dice with [Ganymede](../heroes/ganymede.md) and cheating to win.[^arg-eros-dice] Aphrodite tracked him down and offered him the golden ball that his nurse Adrasteia had made for him in the Idaean cave — "a rounded ball and thou wilt get no better plaything from the hands of Hephaestus." In exchange, Eros was to shoot [Medea](../heroes/medea.md) with an arrow so she would fall in love with Jason.[^arg-eros-bribe]

Eros flew to Colchis and shot the arrow from beneath the lintel of the hall: "he chose from the quiver an arrow unshot before, messenger of pain, and gliding swiftly through the air he shot it at Medea. Speechless amazement seized her soul. The bolt burnt deep down in the maiden's heart like a flame."[^arg-eros-shot] Having accomplished his task, he "darted back from the high-roofed hall laughing aloud."[^arg-eros-laugh]

[^arg-eros-dice]: "Eros was playing at draughts with Ganymede... and was winning his golden knucklebones one by one" (Argonautica 3.114-117, trans. R.C. Seaton)
[^arg-eros-bribe]: "I will give thee the beautiful toy of Zeus, the one his dear nurse Adrasteia made for him while he was still a child... a rounded ball; thou wilt get no better plaything from the hands of Hephaestus" (Argonautica 3.131-137, trans. R.C. Seaton)
[^arg-eros-shot]: "out of the quiver he took a new shaft, fraught with pain, and swiftly passing through the air he shot it at Medea; and speechless amazement seized her soul. And the bolt burnt deep in the maiden's heart like a flame" (Argonautica 3.275-280, trans. R.C. Seaton)
[^arg-eros-laugh]: "but Eros passed back again out of the high-roofed hall laughing" (Argonautica 3.284-285, trans. R.C. Seaton)

## Appearances

- **[Theogony](../sources/theogony.md)** 120-122: Origin and description as primordial cosmic force
- **[Argonautica](../sources/argonautica.md)** 3: Playing dice with Ganymede in Zeus's orchard; bribed by Aphrodite with Zeus's golden ball; shot Medea beneath the hall's lintel with "an arrow unshot before, messenger of pain"; the bolt "burnt deep down in the maiden's heart like a flame"; laughed and darted away

## Notes

The Theogony presents Eros as one of the very first beings, a primordial cosmic force that predates the gods. The Argonautica's Eros — a childish, cheating, bribable son of Aphrodite — represents a very different tradition. These are effectively two separate figures who share a name.
