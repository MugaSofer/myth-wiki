## Overview

**Eros** (Love) is a primordial deity who arose at the beginning of creation, alongside [Earth](gaia.md) and [Tartarus](../places/tartarus.md), shortly after [Chaos](chaos.md).

## Description

Eros is described as "fairest among the deathless gods, who unnerves the limbs and overcomes the mind and wise counsels of all gods and all men within them."[^theog-eros]

[^theog-eros]: "Eros (Love), fairest among the deathless gods, who unnerves the limbs and overcomes the mind and wise counsels of all gods and all men within them" (Theogony 120-122, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Notes

This is Eros as a primordial cosmic force, not the later tradition of Eros as a son of [Aphrodite](aphrodite.md). Hesiod presents Eros as one of the very first beings, predating the gods.
