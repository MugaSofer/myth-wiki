## Overview

The **Fates** (Moirai/Moerae) are three goddesses who control destiny: **Clotho**, **Lachesis**, and **Atropos**. They appear twice in the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md) with different parentage — once as daughters of [Night](night.md), and once as daughters of [Zeus](zeus.md) and [Themis](themis.md).

## Variant Traditions

### As Daughters of Night

[Night](night.md) "bare the Destinies and ruthless avenging Fates, Clotho and Lachesis and Atropos, who give men at their birth both evil and good to have, and they pursue the transgressions of men and of gods: and these goddesses never cease from their dread anger until they punish the sinner with a sore penalty."[^theog-night]

[^theog-night]: "Also she bare the Destinies and ruthless avenging Fates, Clotho and Lachesis and Atropos, who give men at their birth both evil and good to have, and they pursue the transgressions of men and of gods: and these goddesses never cease from their dread anger until they punish the sinner with a sore penalty" (Theogony 217-222, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

### As Daughters of Zeus and Themis

[Zeus](zeus.md) "married bright [Themis](themis.md) who bare the Horae (Hours)... and the Moerae (Fates) to whom wise Zeus gave the greatest honour, Clotho, and Lachesis, and Atropos who give mortal men evil and good to have."[^theog-themis]

[^theog-themis]: "Next he married bright Themis who bare the Horae (Hours), and Eunomia (Order), Dike (Justice), and blooming Eirene (Peace), who mind the works of mortal men, and the Moerae (Fates) to whom wise Zeus gave the greatest honour, Clotho, and Lachesis, and Atropos who give mortal men evil and good to have" (Theogony 901-906, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
