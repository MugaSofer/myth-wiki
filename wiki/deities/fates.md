## Overview

The **Fates** (Moirai/Moerae) are three goddesses who control destiny: **Clotho**, **Lachesis**, and **Atropos**. They appear twice in the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md) with different parentage — once as daughters of [Night](night.md), and once as daughters of [Zeus](zeus.md) and [Themis](themis.md).

## Variant Traditions

### As Daughters of Night

[Night](night.md) "bare the Destinies and ruthless avenging Fates, Clotho and Lachesis and Atropos, who give men at their birth both evil and good to have, and they pursue the transgressions of men and of gods: and these goddesses never cease from their dread anger until they punish the sinner with a sore penalty."[^theog-night]

[^theog-night]: "Also she bare the Destinies and ruthless avenging Fates, Clotho and Lachesis and Atropos, who give men at their birth both evil and good to have, and they pursue the transgressions of men and of gods: and these goddesses never cease from their dread anger until they punish the sinner with a sore penalty" (Theogony 217-222, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

### As Daughters of Zeus and Themis

[Zeus](zeus.md) "married bright [Themis](themis.md) who bare the Horae (Hours)... and the Moerae (Fates) to whom wise Zeus gave the greatest honour, Clotho, and Lachesis, and Atropos who give mortal men evil and good to have."[^theog-themis]

[^theog-themis]: "Next he married bright Themis who bare the Horae (Hours), and Eunomia (Order), Dike (Justice), and blooming Eirene (Peace), who mind the works of mortal men, and the Moerae (Fates) to whom wise Zeus gave the greatest honour, Clotho, and Lachesis, and Atropos who give mortal men evil and good to have" (Theogony 901-906, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## In the Bibliotheca

### The Gigantomachy (1.6.2)

During the battle with the [Giants](../creatures/giants.md), "the Fates, fighting with brazen clubs, killed Agrius and Thoas."[^apd-fates-giants]

### Beguiling Typhon (1.6.3)

During [Zeus](zeus.md)'s pursuit of [Typhoeus](../creatures/typhoeus.md), the Fates played a crucial role in his defeat: at Mount Nysa, "the Fates beguiled the fugitive; for he tasted of the ephemeral fruits in the persuasion that he would be strengthened thereby."[^apd-fates-typhon]

[^apd-fates-giants]: "the Fates, fighting with brazen clubs, killed Agrius and Thoas" (Bibliotheca 1.6.2, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-fates-typhon]: "the Fates beguiled the fugitive; for he tasted of the ephemeral fruits in the persuasion that he would be strengthened thereby" (Bibliotheca 1.6.3, trans. Frazer)

### The Meleager Brand (1.8.2)

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) gives the Fates a vivid narrative role in the myth of Meleager. "When he was seven days old, the Fates came and declared that Meleager should die when the brand burning on the hearth was burnt out." His mother Althaea snatched the brand from the fire and hid it in a chest, preserving his life. Years later, when Meleager killed her brothers (the sons of Thestius), Althaea burned the brand "and Meleager immediately expired."[^apd-brand]

The Fates also appear in the story of Admetus, where [Apollo](apollo.md) "obtained as a favour of the Fates that, when Admetus should be about to die, he might be released from death if someone should choose voluntarily to die for him."[^apd-admetus]

[^apd-brand]: "when he was seven days old, the Fates came and declared that Meleager should die when the brand burning on the hearth was burnt out. On hearing that, Althaea snatched up the brand and deposited it in a chest" (Bibliotheca 1.8.2, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-admetus]: "obtained as a favour of the Fates that, when Admetus should be about to die, he might be released from death if someone should choose voluntarily to die for him" (Bibliotheca 1.9.15, trans. Frazer)
