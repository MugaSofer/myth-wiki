## Overview

**Hestia** is the eldest child of [Cronos](cronos.md) and [Rhea](rhea.md), and one of the Olympian gods.

## Birth

Hestia is listed first among the children of [Rhea](rhea.md) and [Cronos](cronos.md): "[Rhea](rhea.md) was subject in love to [Cronos](cronos.md) and bare splendid children, Hestia, [Demeter](demeter.md), and gold-shod [Hera](hera.md) and strong [Hades](hades.md), pitiless in heart, who dwells under the earth, and the loud-crashing Earth-Shaker [[Poseidon](poseidon.md)], and wise [Zeus](zeus.md)."[^theog-birth]

As the firstborn, she was the first swallowed by Cronos and the last to be disgorged.

[^theog-birth]: "Rhea was subject in love to Cronos and bare splendid children, Hestia, Demeter, and gold-shod Hera and strong Hades, pitiless in heart, who dwells under the earth, and the loud-crashing Earth-Shaker, and wise Zeus, father of gods and men, by whose thunder the wide earth is shaken" (Theogony 453-458, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Oath of Virginity (Hymn to Aphrodite)

The [Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) (V) names Hestia as one of three goddesses immune to [Aphrodite](aphrodite.md)'s power. "The pure maiden Hestia" is called "the first-born child of wily [Cronos](cronos.md) and youngest too" — first swallowed and last disgorged. "Both [Poseidon](poseidon.md) and [Apollo](apollo.md) sought to wed" her, "but she was wholly unwilling, nay, stubbornly refused; and touching the head of father [Zeus](zeus.md)... she, that fair goddess, sware a great oath which has in truth been fulfilled, that she would be a maiden all her days." In return, [Zeus](zeus.md) "gave her an high honour instead of marriage, and she has her place in the midst of the house and has the richest portion. In all the temples of the gods she has a share of honour, and among all mortal men she is chief of the goddesses."[^hh5-hestia]

[^hh5-hestia]: "Nor yet does the pure maiden Hestia love Aphrodite's works. She was the first-born child of wily Cronos and youngest too, by will of Zeus who holds the aegis,—a queenly maid whom both Poseidon and Apollo sought to wed. But she was wholly unwilling, nay, stubbornly refused; and touching the head of father Zeus who holds the aegis, she, that fair goddess, sware a great oath which has in truth been fulfilled, that she would be a maiden all her days. So Zeus the Father gave her an high honour instead of marriage, and she has her place in the midst of the house and has the richest portion. In all the temples of the gods she has a share of honour, and among all mortal men she is chief of the goddesses." (Homeric Hymn V to Aphrodite 21-32, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
