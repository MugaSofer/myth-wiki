| **First appearance** | [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md) 411 |

## Overview

**Hecate** receives an exceptionally detailed and reverent treatment in the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md). She is an only child whom [Zeus](zeus.md) "honoured above all," granting her power over earth, sea, and heaven — privileges she held even before Zeus's rule, among the Titan gods.[^theog-honour][^theog-status]

[^theog-honour]: "Zeus the son of Cronos honoured above all. He gave her splendid gifts, to have a share of the earth and the unfruitful sea. She received honour also in starry heaven" (Theogony 411-414, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Epithets

Hecate is consistently called "bright-coiffed" (Hymn to Demeter 25, 438) and "tender-hearted" (Hymn to Demeter 24). The Theogony calls her "the glorious goddess" (Theogony 441). She is associated with torches — in the Hymn to Demeter she carries "a torch in her hands" when she meets [Demeter](demeter.md) (52) and "flaming torches" as they go together to [Helius](helius.md) (61).

## Domains & Powers

Hecate's reach is remarkably broad. Hesiod describes her influence in nearly every sphere of human activity:

- **Worship**: "Whenever any one of men on earth offers rich sacrifices and prays for favour according to custom, he calls upon Hecate."[^theog-prayer]
- **Wealth**: "She bestows wealth upon him; for the power surely is with her."[^theog-wealth]
- **Judgement**: "She sits by worshipful kings in judgement, and in the assembly whom she will is distinguished among the people."[^theog-kings]
- **War**: "When men arm themselves for the battle that destroys men, then the goddess is at hand to give victory and grant glory readily to whom she will."[^theog-war]
- **Athletics**: "She is good also when men contend at the games."[^theog-games]
- **Horsemanship**: "She is good to stand by horsemen, whom she will."[^theog-horse]
- **Sea**: "Those whose business is in the grey discomfortable sea, and who pray to Hecate and the loud-crashing Earth-Shaker, easily the glorious goddess gives great catch."[^theog-sea]
- **Herds**: "She is good in the byre with Hermes to increase the stock."[^theog-herds]
- **Nurture**: "The son of [Cronos](cronos.md) made her a nurse of the young."[^theog-nurse]

[^theog-nurse]: "the son of Cronos made her a nurse of the young who after that day saw with their eyes the light of all-seeing Dawn" (Theogony 450-452)

## Status Among the Gods

Hesiod emphasizes that Zeus "did her no wrong nor took anything away of all that was her portion among the former Titan gods: but she holds, as the division was at the first from the beginning, privilege both in earth, and in heaven, and in sea."[^theog-status] She is "honoured amongst all the deathless gods" despite being "her mother's only child."[^theog-only]

[^theog-status]: "The son of Cronos did her no wrong nor took anything away of all that was her portion among the former Titan gods: but she holds, as the division was at the first from the beginning, privilege both in earth, and in heaven, and in sea" (Theogony 423-427)
[^theog-only]: "albeit her mother's only child, she is honoured amongst all the deathless gods" (Theogony 448-452)

## In the Hymn to Demeter

Hecate plays a key role in the [Homeric Hymn to Demeter](../sources/homeric-hymns.md). She was the only one besides [Helius](helius.md) who heard [Persephone](persephone.md)'s cry: "only tender-hearted Hecate, bright-coiffed, the daughter of Persaeus, heard the girl from her cave."[^hd-heard]

On the tenth day of [Demeter](demeter.md)'s search, "Hecate, with a torch in her hands, met her, and spoke to her and told her news: 'Queenly Demeter, bringer of seasons and giver of good gifts, what god of heaven or what mortal man has rapt away Persephone and pierced with sorrow your dear heart? For I heard her voice, yet saw not with my eyes who it was.'"[^hd-news]

After Persephone's return, "bright-coiffed Hecate came near to them, and often did she embrace the daughter of holy Demeter: and from that time the lady Hecate was minister and companion to Persephone."[^hd-companion]

[^hd-heard]: "only tender-hearted Hecate, bright-coiffed, the daughter of Persaeus, heard the girl from her cave, and the lord Helios, Hyperion's bright son" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 24-27, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^hd-news]: "Hecate, with a torch in her hands, met her, and spoke to her and told her news: 'Queenly Demeter, bringer of seasons and giver of good gifts, what god of heaven or what mortal man has rapt away Persephone and pierced with sorrow your dear heart? For I heard her voice, yet saw not with my eyes who it was'" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 51-58)
[^hd-companion]: "bright-coiffed Hecate came near to them, and often did she embrace the daughter of holy Demeter: and from that time the lady Hecate was minister and companion to Persephone" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 438-440)

## Appearances

- **[Theogony](../sources/theogony.md)** 411-452: Extended hymn to Hecate
- **[Homeric Hymn to Demeter](../sources/homeric-hymns.md)** 24-27, 51-58, 438-440: Hears Persephone's cry; aids Demeter's search; becomes Persephone's companion

## Notes

Hesiod's treatment of Hecate is strikingly extensive compared to most other deities in the Theogony — she receives more lines than any Olympian at this point. Scholars have debated whether this reflects a personal or local devotion on Hesiod's part.
