## Overview

**Hecate** receives an exceptionally detailed and reverent treatment in the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md). She is an only child whom [Zeus](zeus.md) "honoured above all," granting her power over earth, sea, and heaven — privileges she held even before Zeus's rule, among the Titan gods.[^theog-honour][^theog-status]

[^theog-honour]: "Zeus the son of Cronos honoured above all. He gave her splendid gifts, to have a share of the earth and the unfruitful sea. She received honour also in starry heaven" (Theogony 411-414, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Epithets

Hecate is consistently called "bright-coiffed" (Hymn to Demeter 25, 438) and "tender-hearted" (Hymn to Demeter 24). The Theogony calls her "the glorious goddess" (Theogony 441). She is associated with torches — in the Hymn to Demeter she carries "a torch in her hands" when she meets [Demeter](demeter.md) (52) and "flaming torches" as they go together to [Helius](helius.md) (61).

## Domains & Powers

Hecate's reach is remarkably broad. Hesiod describes her influence in nearly every sphere of human activity:

- **Worship**: "Whenever any one of men on earth offers rich sacrifices and prays for favour according to custom, he calls upon Hecate."[^theog-prayer]
- **Wealth**: "She bestows wealth upon him; for the power surely is with her."[^theog-wealth]
- **Judgement**: "She sits by worshipful kings in judgement, and in the assembly whom she will is distinguished among the people."[^theog-kings]
- **War**: "When men arm themselves for the battle that destroys men, then the goddess is at hand to give victory and grant glory readily to whom she will."[^theog-war]
- **Athletics**: "She is good also when men contend at the games."[^theog-games]
- **Horsemanship**: "She is good to stand by horsemen, whom she will."[^theog-horse]
- **Sea**: "Those whose business is in the grey discomfortable sea, and who pray to Hecate and the loud-crashing Earth-Shaker, easily the glorious goddess gives great catch."[^theog-sea]
- **Herds**: "She is good in the byre with Hermes to increase the stock."[^theog-herds]
- **Nurture**: "The son of [Cronos](cronos.md) made her a nurse of the young."[^theog-nurse]

[^theog-prayer]: "whenever any one of men on earth offers rich sacrifices and prays for favour according to custom, he calls upon Hecate" (Theogony 416-418)
[^theog-wealth]: "she bestows wealth upon him; for the power surely is with her" (Theogony 419-420)
[^theog-kings]: "she sits by worshipful kings in judgement, and in the assembly whom she will is distinguished among the people" (Theogony 429-430)
[^theog-war]: "when men arm themselves for the battle that destroys men, then the goddess is at hand to give victory and grant glory readily to whom she will" (Theogony 431-433)
[^theog-games]: "when men contend at the games, for there too the goddess is with them and profits them" (Theogony 435)
[^theog-horse]: "she is good to stand by horsemen, whom she will" (Theogony 439)
[^theog-sea]: "those whose business is in the grey discomfortable sea, and who pray to Hecate and the loud-crashing Earth-Shaker, easily the glorious goddess gives great catch" (Theogony 440-443)
[^theog-herds]: "She is good in the byre with Hermes to increase the stock. The droves of kine and wide herds of goats and flocks of fleecy sheep, if she will, she increases from a few, or makes many to be less" (Theogony 444-447)
[^theog-nurse]: "the son of Cronos made her a nurse of the young who after that day saw with their eyes the light of all-seeing Dawn" (Theogony 450-452)

## Status Among the Gods

Hesiod emphasizes that Zeus "did her no wrong nor took anything away of all that was her portion among the former Titan gods: but she holds, as the division was at the first from the beginning, privilege both in earth, and in heaven, and in sea."[^theog-status] She is "honoured amongst all the deathless gods" despite being "her mother's only child."[^theog-only]

[^theog-status]: "The son of Cronos did her no wrong nor took anything away of all that was her portion among the former Titan gods: but she holds, as the division was at the first from the beginning, privilege both in earth, and in heaven, and in sea" (Theogony 423-427)
[^theog-only]: "albeit her mother's only child, she is honoured amongst all the deathless gods" (Theogony 448-452)

## In the Hymn to Demeter

Hecate plays a key role in the [Homeric Hymn to Demeter](../sources/homeric-hymns.md). She was the only one besides [Helius](helius.md) who heard [Persephone](persephone.md)'s cry: "only tender-hearted Hecate, bright-coiffed, the daughter of Persaeus, heard the girl from her cave."[^hd-heard]

On the tenth day of [Demeter](demeter.md)'s search, "Hecate, with a torch in her hands, met her, and spoke to her and told her news: 'Queenly Demeter, bringer of seasons and giver of good gifts, what god of heaven or what mortal man has rapt away Persephone and pierced with sorrow your dear heart? For I heard her voice, yet saw not with my eyes who it was.'"[^hd-news]

After Persephone's return, "bright-coiffed Hecate came near to them, and often did she embrace the daughter of holy Demeter: and from that time the lady Hecate was minister and companion to Persephone."[^hd-companion]

[^hd-heard]: "only tender-hearted Hecate, bright-coiffed, the daughter of Persaeus, heard the girl from her cave, and the lord Helios, Hyperion's bright son" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 24-27, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^hd-news]: "Hecate, with a torch in her hands, met her, and spoke to her and told her news: 'Queenly Demeter, bringer of seasons and giver of good gifts, what god of heaven or what mortal man has rapt away Persephone and pierced with sorrow your dear heart? For I heard her voice, yet saw not with my eyes who it was'" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 51-58)
[^hd-companion]: "bright-coiffed Hecate came near to them, and often did she embrace the daughter of holy Demeter: and from that time the lady Hecate was minister and companion to Persephone" (Homeric Hymn to Demeter 438-440)

## In the [Argonautica](../sources/argonautica.md)

Hecate looms large in the Argonautica through her relationship with Medea, who serves as her priestess at Colchis.

### Medea's Goddess

Medea is described throughout as Hecate's special charge. Apollonius presents the goddess under her alternate name **Brimo** — "nurse of youth, night-wandering Brimo, of the underworld, queen among the dead" — in the incantation Medea uses to charm the sleepless serpent guarding the fleece.[^arg-hec-brimo]

### The Midnight Invocation

For Jason to receive Medea's protective charm, she required him to perform a midnight sacrifice to Hecate at a crossroads. The epiphany was terrifying: the goddess came "from the uttermost depths," and with her came the sounds of oak trees crashing and the earth bellowing; she was surrounded by "horrible serpents twined among the oak boughs," "countless torches," and "the hounds of hell baying shrilly."[^arg-hec-epiphany] Jason, forewarned by Medea, did not look back when these signs came and stood firm until morning.

### Mother of Scylla

In a genealogical note, Apollonius names Hecate (under the epithet **Crataeis**) as the mother of [Scylla](../creatures/scylla.md), by [Phorcys](../creatures/scylla.md).[^arg-hec-scylla]

[^arg-hec-brimo]: "adjuring Brimo the night-wanderer, the nurse of youth, the chthonian queen, to be her helper" (Argonautica 3.861-862, trans. R.C. Seaton)
[^arg-hec-epiphany]: "the goddess moved with horrible serpents twined among oak boughs, and there was a gleam of countless torches; and the hounds of hell barked shrilly all around her" (Argonautica 3.1216-1222, trans. R.C. Seaton)
[^arg-hec-scylla]: "Scylla, the destructive monster whom Crataeis bore... Crataeis is the mother of Scylla and she bore her to Phorcys" (Argonautica 4.828-829, trans. R.C. Seaton)

## In the Bibliotheca (1.6.2)

### Slaying Clytius in the Gigantomachy

During the battle with the [Giants](../creatures/giants.md), "Clytius [was killed] by Hecate with torches."[^apd-hec-clytius]

> **NOTE:** Hecate's use of torches as weapons connects to her established association with them in the [Homeric Hymn to Demeter](../sources/homeric-hymns.md), where she carries "a torch in her hands" (52) and "flaming torches" (61).

[^apd-hec-clytius]: "Clytius by Hecate with torches" (Bibliotheca 1.6.2, trans. Frazer)

## Appearances

- **[Argonautica](../sources/argonautica.md)** 3, 4: Medea was her priestess; called Brimo, "nurse of youth, night-wandering, queen among the dead"; appeared at Jason's midnight sacrifice with serpents in oak boughs, countless torches, and howling hell-hounds; invoked by Medea to charm the serpent; named Crataeis, mother of Scylla by Phorcys
- **[Theogony](../sources/theogony.md)** 411-452: Extended hymn to Hecate
- **[Homeric Hymn to Demeter](../sources/homeric-hymns.md)** 24-27, 51-58, 438-440: Hears Persephone's cry; aids Demeter's search; becomes Persephone's companion
- **[Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md)** 1.2.4: "to Perses and Asteria was born Hecate" — confirms Theogonic parentage
- **[Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md)** 1.6.2: Killed the giant Clytius with torches in the [Gigantomachy](../creatures/giants.md)
- **Catalogue of Women** Fragment 71: Iphigenia "was not killed but, by the will of [Artemis](artemis.md), became Hecate" — an extraordinary identification of the sacrificed princess with the goddess
- **Great Eoiae** Fragment 13: Named as mother of [Scylla](../creatures/scylla.md) (with [Apollo](apollo.md) as father)

## Notes

Hesiod's treatment of Hecate is strikingly extensive compared to most other deities in the Theogony — she receives more lines than any Olympian at this point. Scholars have debated whether this reflects a personal or local devotion on Hesiod's part.
