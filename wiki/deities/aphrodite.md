## Overview

**Aphrodite** is the goddess of love. In Hesiod's [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md), she was born from the sea-foam that gathered around the severed genitals of [Uranus](uranus.md) after [Cronos](cronos.md) cast them into the sea.

## Birth

When [Cronos](cronos.md) cut off [Uranus](uranus.md)'s members and cast them into the sea, "they were swept away over the main a long time: and a white foam spread around them from the immortal flesh, and in it there grew a maiden."[^theog-birth] She first approached holy Cythera, then came to sea-girt Cyprus, "and came forth an awful and lovely goddess, and grass grew up about her beneath her shapely feet."[^theog-landing]

[^theog-birth]: "they were swept away over the main a long time: and a white foam spread around them from the immortal flesh, and in it there grew a maiden" (Theogony 189-192)
[^theog-landing]: "she came to sea-girt Cyprus, and came forth an awful and lovely goddess, and grass grew up about her beneath her shapely feet" (Theogony 192-194)

## Epithets

Her names are etymologized in the text:[^theog-names]
- **Aphrodite** — "because she grew amid the foam" (Greek *aphros* = foam)
- **Cytherea** — "because she reached Cythera"
- **Cyprogenes** — "because she was born in billowy Cyprus"
- **Philommedes** — "because sprang from the members"
- **foam-born goddess**
- **rich-crowned Cytherea**

[^theog-names]: "Her gods and men call Aphrodite, and the foam-born goddess and rich-crowned Cytherea, because she grew amid the foam, and Cytherea because she reached Cythera, and Cyprogenes because she was born in billowy Cyprus, and Philommedes because sprang from the members" (Theogony 195-200)

## Domains & Powers

"This honour she has from the beginning, and this is the portion allotted to her amongst men and undying gods,—the whisperings of maidens and smiles and deceits with sweet delight and love and graciousness."[^theog-domain]

At her birth, [Eros](eros.md) and "comely Desire" accompanied her: "with her went Eros, and comely Desire followed her at her birth at the first and as she went into the assembly of the gods."[^theog-eros]

[^theog-domain]: "This honour she has from the beginning, and this is the portion allotted to her amongst men and undying gods,--the whisperings of maidens and smiles and deceits with sweet delight and love and graciousness" (Theogony 201-206)
[^theog-eros]: "with her went Eros, and comely Desire followed her at her birth at the first and as she went into the assembly of the gods" (Theogony 201-202)

## Appearance

She is described as "an awful and lovely goddess," and "grass grew up about her beneath her shapely feet."[^theog-desc]

Additional epithets include **"violet-crowned Cytherea"** and **"sweetly-winning, coy-eyed goddess"** (Hymn VI 18, 19).[^desc-violet]

In the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md), when Aphrodite disguises herself as an old woman, Helen sees through it by recognising "the fair neck and lovely breast and sparkling eyes of the goddess."[^il3-disguise] Her raiment is described as "ambrosial" and woven by the [Graces](graces.md) themselves.[^il5-wound]

### Appearance to Anchises (Hymn V)

When Aphrodite appeared to Anchises in disguise, "she was clad in a robe out-shining the brightness of fire, a splendid robe of gold, enriched with all manner of needlework, which shimmered like the moon over her tender breasts, a marvel to see. Also she wore twisted brooches and shining earrings in the form of flowers; and round her soft throat were lovely necklaces."[^desc-anchises]

When she revealed her true form, "her head reached to the well-hewn roof-tree; from her cheeks shone unearthly beauty such as belongs to rich-crowned Cytherea."[^desc-reveal]

### Adorned by the Hours (Hymn VI)

[Homeric Hymn VI](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) describes her adornment after rising from the sea: "on her head they put a fine, well-wrought crown of gold, and in her pierced ears they hung ornaments of orichalc and precious gold, and adorned her with golden necklaces over her soft neck and snow-white breasts." When she was brought before the gods, "each one of them prayed that he might lead her home to be his wedded wife, so greatly were they amazed at the beauty of violet-crowned Cytherea."[^desc-adorned]

[^theog-desc]: "came forth an awful and lovely goddess, and grass grew up about her beneath her shapely feet" (Theogony 194-195, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^desc-violet]: "Hail, sweetly-winning, coy-eyed goddess!" (Homeric Hymn VI to Aphrodite 19)
[^desc-anchises]: "she was clad in a robe out-shining the brightness of fire, a splendid robe of gold, enriched with all manner of needlework, which shimmered like the moon over her tender breasts, a marvel to see. Also she wore twisted brooches and shining earrings in the form of flowers; and round her soft throat were lovely necklaces" (Homeric Hymn V to Aphrodite 86-90)
[^desc-reveal]: "her head reached to the well-hewn roof-tree; from her cheeks shone unearthly beauty such as belongs to rich-crowned Cytherea" (Homeric Hymn V to Aphrodite 173-175)
[^desc-adorned]: "on her head they put a fine, well-wrought crown of gold, and in her pierced ears they hung ornaments of orichalc and precious gold, and adorned her with golden necklaces over her soft neck and snow-white breasts, jewels which the gold-filleted Hours wear themselves... so greatly were they amazed at the beauty of violet-crowned Cytherea" (Homeric Hymn VI to Aphrodite 7-18)

## The Three Immune to Aphrodite (Hymn V)

The [Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) (V) names three goddesses whose hearts she "cannot bend nor yet ensnare": [Athena](athena.md) ("she has no pleasure in the deeds of golden Aphrodite, but delights in wars and in the work of [Ares](ares.md)"), [Artemis](artemis.md) ("she loves archery and the slaying of wild beasts"), and [Hestia](hestia.md), who "sware a great oath... that she would be a maiden all her days."[^hh5-three]

The Hymn emphasizes that "of all others there is nothing among the blessed gods or among mortal men that has escaped Aphrodite. Even the heart of [Zeus](zeus.md), who delights in thunder, is led astray by her."[^hh5-power]

## Aphrodite and Anchises (Hymn V)

To humble Aphrodite's pride, [Zeus](zeus.md) "cast sweet desire" in her heart for the mortal Anchises, "to the end that, very soon, not even she should be innocent of a mortal's love." She disguised herself as a mortal maiden and came to him on Mount Ida. "By the will of the gods and destiny he lay with her, a mortal man with an immortal goddess, not clearly knowing what he did."[^hh5-anchises]

When she revealed her true form, Anchises was terrified: "he who lies with a deathless goddess is no hale man afterwards." Aphrodite reassured him and foretold their son: "His name shall be Aeneas, because I felt awful grief in that I laid me in the bed of mortal man." But she warned him never to reveal the truth, "lest Zeus will smite you in his anger with a smoking thunderbolt."[^hh5-aeneas]

She also lamented: "now my mouth shall no more have this power among the gods; for very great has been my madness, my miserable and dreadful madness."[^hh5-shame]

### Eos and Tithonus

In the Hymn, Aphrodite tells the story of [Eos](eos.md) and Tithonus as a cautionary tale. Eos asked [Zeus](zeus.md) for Tithonus's immortality but forgot to ask for eternal youth: "when loathsome old age pressed full upon him, and he could not move nor lift his limbs... she laid him in a room and put to the shining doors. There he babbles endlessly, and no more has strength at all."[^hh5-tithonus]

[^hh5-three]: "Yet there are three hearts that she cannot bend nor yet ensnare. First is the daughter of Zeus who holds the aegis, bright-eyed Athene... Nor does laughter-loving Aphrodite ever tame in love Artemis, the huntress with shafts of gold... Nor yet does the pure maiden Hestia love Aphrodite's works" (Homeric Hymn V to Aphrodite 7-32, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^hh5-power]: "of all others there is nothing among the blessed gods or among mortal men that has escaped Aphrodite. Even the heart of Zeus, who delights in thunder, is led astray by her" (Homeric Hymn V to Aphrodite 33-36)
[^hh5-anchises]: "upon Aphrodite herself Zeus cast sweet desire to be joined in love with a mortal man... by the will of the gods and destiny he lay with her, a mortal man with an immortal goddess, not clearly knowing what he did" (Homeric Hymn V to Aphrodite 45-167)
[^hh5-aeneas]: "His name shall be Aeneas, because I felt awful grief in that I laid me in the bed of mortal man... if you tell all and foolishly boast that you lay with rich-crowned Aphrodite, Zeus will smite you in his anger with a smoking thunderbolt" (Homeric Hymn V to Aphrodite 198-290)
[^hh5-shame]: "now my mouth shall no more have this power among the gods; for very great has been my madness, my miserable and dreadful madness, and I went astray out of my mind who have gotten a child beneath my girdle, mating with a mortal man" (Homeric Hymn V to Aphrodite 247-253)
[^hh5-tithonus]: "when loathsome old age pressed full upon him, and he could not move nor lift his limbs, this seemed to her in her heart the best counsel: she laid him in a room and put to the shining doors. There he babbles endlessly, and no more has strength at all, such as once he had in his supple limbs" (Homeric Hymn V to Aphrodite 233-238)

## In the Iliad

### Rescuing Paris (Book III)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book III, when Menelaos is about to kill Paris in single combat, "Zeus' daughter Aphrodite was swift to mark, and tore asunder for him the strap of slaughtered ox's hide; so the helmet came away empty in his stalwart hand." Then "Aphrodite snatched up Paris, very easily as a goddess may, and hid him in thick darkness, and sent him down in his fragrant perfumed chamber."[^il3-rescue]

### Summoning Helen

Aphrodite then goes to Helen "in the likeness of an aged dame, a woolcomber that was wont to work for her fair wool when she dwelt in Lakedaimon." But Helen sees through the disguise: "she marked the fair neck and lovely breast and sparkling eyes of the goddess, she marvelled straightway."[^il3-disguise]

Helen defies her: "Go and sit thou by his side, and depart from the way of the gods; neither let thy feet ever bear thee back to [Olympus](../places/olympus.md)." Aphrodite threatens her in return: "Provoke me not, rash woman, lest in mine anger I desert thee, and hate thee even as now I love thee beyond measure, and lest I devise grievous enmities between both, even betwixt Trojans and Achaians, and so thou perish in evil wise."[^il3-threat]

Helen obeys in fear. Aphrodite then serves her directly: "laughter-loving Aphrodite took for her a chair and brought it, even she the goddess, and set it before the face of Paris."[^il3-chair]

[^il3-rescue]: "Zeus' daughter Aphrodite was swift to mark, and tore asunder for him the strap of slaughtered ox's hide; so the helmet came away empty in his stalwart hand... Aphrodite snatched up Paris, very easily as a goddess may, and hid him in thick darkness, and sent him down in his fragrant perfumed chamber" (Iliad III.1975-1982, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il3-disguise]: "she marked the fair neck and lovely breast and sparkling eyes of the goddess, she marvelled straightway and spake a word and called upon her name: 'Strange queen, why art thou desirous now to beguile me?'" (Iliad III.1994-1996)
[^il3-threat]: "Provoke me not, rash woman, lest in mine anger I desert thee, and hate thee even as now I love thee beyond measure, and lest I devise grievous enmities between both, even betwixt Trojans and Achaians, and so thou perish in evil wise" (Iliad III.2009-2013)
[^il3-chair]: "laughter-loving Aphrodite took for her a chair and brought it, even she the goddess, and set it before the face of Paris" (Iliad III.2021-2022)

## In the Odyssey

### The Song of Ares and Aphrodite (Book VIII)

In [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) Book VIII, the minstrel Demodocus sings the tale of [Ares](ares.md) and Aphrodite's adultery. Ares "gave her many gifts, and dishonoured the marriage bed of the lord [Hephaestus](hephaestus.md)." [Helius](helius.md) spied them and reported to Hephaestus, who forged an unbreakable net and trapped them in his bed.[^od8-adultery]

Hephaestus summoned the gods to witness, crying: "Aphrodite, daughter of [Zeus](zeus.md), ever dishonours me by reason of my lameness, and sets her heart on Ares the destroyer, because he is fair and straight of limb, but as for me, feeble was I born."[^od8-heph-cry]

The male gods gathered — [Poseidon](poseidon.md), [Hermes](hermes.md), and [Apollo](apollo.md) — "but the lady goddesses abode each within her house for shame." [Apollo](apollo.md) asked Hermes if he would lie with golden Aphrodite despite the bonds; Hermes replied: "So might thrice as many bonds innumerable encompass me about, and all ye gods be looking on and all the goddesses, yet would I lie by golden Aphrodite."[^od8-hermes]

After Poseidon guaranteed the fine, "laughter-loving Aphrodite went to Paphos of Cyprus, where is her precinct and fragrant altar. There the [Graces](graces.md) bathed and anointed her with oil imperishable, such as is laid upon the everlasting gods. And they clad her in lovely raiment, a wonder to see."[^od8-paphos]

[^od8-adultery]: "he sang of the love of Ares and Aphrodite, of the fair crown, how at the first they lay together in the house of Hephaestus privily; and Ares gave her many gifts, and dishonoured the marriage bed of the lord Hephaestus. And anon there came to him one to report the thing, even Helios, that had seen them at their pastime" (Odyssey VIII.4407-4411, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od8-heph-cry]: "Aphrodite, daughter of Zeus, ever dishonours me by reason of my lameness, and sets her heart on Ares the destroyer, because he is fair and straight of limb, but as for me, feeble was I born. Howbeit, there is none to blame but my father and mother,—would they had never begotten me!" (Odyssey VIII.4446-4450)
[^od8-hermes]: "So might thrice as many bonds innumerable encompass me about, and all ye gods be looking on and all the goddesses, yet would I lie by golden Aphrodite" (Odyssey VIII.4480-4481)
[^od8-paphos]: "laughter-loving Aphrodite went to Paphos of Cyprus, where is her precinct and fragrant altar. There the Graces bathed and anointed her with oil imperishable, such as is laid upon the everlasting gods. And they clad her in lovely raiment, a wonder to see" (Odyssey VIII.4505-4508)

### Wounded by Diomedes / Ichor (Book V)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book V, Aphrodite shields her son Aeneas from Diomedes: "About her dear son wound she her white arms, and spread before his face a fold of her radiant vesture." But Diomedes, empowered by [Athena](athena.md), "thrust with his keen spear, and leapt on her and wounded the skin of her weak hand; straight through the ambrosial raiment that the [Graces](graces.md) themselves had woven her pierced the dart into the flesh."[^il5-wound]

Then flows "the goddess's immortal blood, such ichor as floweth in the blessed gods; for they eat no bread neither drink they gleaming wine, wherefore they are bloodless and are named immortals."[^il5-ichor]

She fled in pain to [Olympus](../places/olympus.md) and "fell upon [Dione](dione.md)'s knees that was her mother." [Zeus](zeus.md) told her gently: "Not unto thee, my child, are given the works of war; but follow thou after the loving tasks of wedlock, and to all these things shall fleet [Ares](ares.md) and Athene look."[^il5-zeus]

[^il5-wound]: "great-hearted Tydeus' son thrust with his keen spear, and leapt on her and wounded the skin of her weak hand; straight through the ambrosial raiment that the Graces themselves had woven her pierced the dart into the flesh, above the springing of the palm" (Iliad V.2913-2916, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il5-ichor]: "the goddess's immortal blood, such ichor as floweth in the blessed gods; for they eat no bread neither drink they gleaming wine, wherefore they are bloodless and are named immortals" (Iliad V.2917-2919)
[^il5-zeus]: "Not unto thee, my child, are given the works of war; but follow thou after the loving tasks of wedlock, and to all these things shall fleet Ares and Athene look" (Iliad V.3003-3005)

## In the Bibliotheca (1.4.4)

### Cursing Eos

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) adds a detail about Aphrodite's jealousy: "Aphrodite caused [Eos](eos.md) to be perpetually in love, because she had bedded with [Ares](ares.md)."[^apd-aph-dawn]

> **NEW DETAIL:** This explains the pattern of Eos's mortal loves (Orion in [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) V, Tithonus in [Homeric Hymn V](../sources/homeric-hymns.md), Cleitus in Odyssey XV) as punishment by Aphrodite. It connects to the Odyssey VIII Song of Ares and Aphrodite, where the affair between the two is well established.

[^apd-aph-dawn]: "Aphrodite caused Dawn to be perpetually in love, because she had bedded with Ares" (Bibliotheca 1.4.4, trans. Frazer)

## Variant Traditions

### Birth from Uranus (Theogony) vs Daughter of Dione (Iliad / Bibliotheca)

Hesiod's account of Aphrodite's birth from [Uranus](uranus.md)'s severed members is one of two major traditions. The Iliad presents the other: in Book V, when Aphrodite is wounded, "fair Aphrodite fell upon [Dione](dione.md)'s knees that was her mother."[^il5-dione] [Dione](dione.md) comforts her and speaks as her mother throughout the scene. [Zeus](zeus.md) also addresses Aphrodite as "my child," consistent with her being his daughter by Dione.

Apollodorus follows the Iliad tradition: "by [Dione](dione.md) he had Aphrodite."[^apd-aphrodite-dione] This is notable because Apollodorus is generally drawing on Hesiodic material for his cosmogony — his adoption of the Dione parentage over the Theogony's sea-foam birth represents a deliberate choice.

[^il5-dione]: "fair Aphrodite fell upon Dione's knees that was her mother. She took her daughter in her arms and stroked her with her hand" (Iliad V.2948-2949)
[^apd-aphrodite-dione]: "by Dione he had Aphrodite" (Bibliotheca 1.3.1, trans. Frazer)
[^od18-cytherea]: "Her fair face first she steeped with beauty imperishable, such as that wherewith the crowned Cytherea is anointed, when she goes to the lovely dances of the Graces" (Odyssey 9894-9897, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od20-pandareus]: "fair Aphrodite cherished them with curds and sweet honey and delicious wine... Now while fair Aphrodite was wending to high Olympus, to pray that a glad marriage might be accomplished for the maidens" (Odyssey 10823-10828, trans. Butcher and Lang)
