## Overview

**Aphrodite** is the goddess of love. In Hesiod's [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md), she was born from the sea-foam that gathered around the severed genitals of [Uranus](uranus.md) after [Cronos](cronos.md) cast them into the sea.

## Birth

When [Cronos](cronos.md) cut off [Uranus](uranus.md)'s members and cast them into the sea, "they were swept away over the main a long time: and a white foam spread around them from the immortal flesh, and in it there grew a maiden."[^theog-birth] She first approached holy Cythera, then came to sea-girt Cyprus, "and came forth an awful and lovely goddess, and grass grew up about her beneath her shapely feet."[^theog-landing]

[^theog-birth]: "they were swept away over the main a long time: and a white foam spread around them from the immortal flesh, and in it there grew a maiden" (Theogony 189-192)
[^theog-landing]: "she came to sea-girt Cyprus, and came forth an awful and lovely goddess, and grass grew up about her beneath her shapely feet" (Theogony 192-194)

### Appearance to Anchises (Hymn V)

When Aphrodite appeared to Anchises in disguise, "she was clad in a robe out-shining the brightness of fire, a splendid robe of gold, enriched with all manner of needlework, which shimmered like the moon over her tender breasts, a marvel to see. Also she wore twisted brooches and shining earrings in the form of flowers; and round her soft throat were lovely necklaces."[^desc-anchises]

When she revealed her true form, "her head reached to the well-hewn roof-tree; from her cheeks shone unearthly beauty such as belongs to rich-crowned Cytherea."[^desc-reveal]

### Adorned by the Hours (Hymn VI)

[Homeric Hymn VI](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) describes her adornment after rising from the sea: "on her head they put a fine, well-wrought crown of gold, and in her pierced ears they hung ornaments of orichalc and precious gold, and adorned her with golden necklaces over her soft neck and snow-white breasts." When she was brought before the gods, "each one of them prayed that he might lead her home to be his wedded wife, so greatly were they amazed at the beauty of violet-crowned Cytherea."[^desc-adorned]

[^theog-desc]: "came forth an awful and lovely goddess, and grass grew up about her beneath her shapely feet" (Theogony 194-195, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^desc-violet]: "Hail, sweetly-winning, coy-eyed goddess!" (Homeric Hymn VI to Aphrodite 19)
[^desc-anchises]: "she was clad in a robe out-shining the brightness of fire, a splendid robe of gold, enriched with all manner of needlework, which shimmered like the moon over her tender breasts, a marvel to see. Also she wore twisted brooches and shining earrings in the form of flowers; and round her soft throat were lovely necklaces" (Homeric Hymn V to Aphrodite 86-90)
[^desc-reveal]: "her head reached to the well-hewn roof-tree; from her cheeks shone unearthly beauty such as belongs to rich-crowned Cytherea" (Homeric Hymn V to Aphrodite 173-175)
[^desc-adorned]: "on her head they put a fine, well-wrought crown of gold, and in her pierced ears they hung ornaments of orichalc and precious gold, and adorned her with golden necklaces over her soft neck and snow-white breasts, jewels which the gold-filleted Hours wear themselves... so greatly were they amazed at the beauty of violet-crowned Cytherea" (Homeric Hymn VI to Aphrodite 7-18)

## The Three Immune to Aphrodite (Hymn V)

The [Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) (V) names three goddesses whose hearts she "cannot bend nor yet ensnare": [Athena](athena.md) ("she has no pleasure in the deeds of golden Aphrodite, but delights in wars and in the work of [Ares](ares.md)"), [Artemis](artemis.md) ("she loves archery and the slaying of wild beasts"), and [Hestia](hestia.md), who "sware a great oath... that she would be a maiden all her days."[^hh5-three]

The Hymn emphasizes that "of all others there is nothing among the blessed gods or among mortal men that has escaped Aphrodite. Even the heart of [Zeus](zeus.md), who delights in thunder, is led astray by her."[^hh5-power]

## Aphrodite and Anchises (Hymn V)

To humble Aphrodite's pride, [Zeus](zeus.md) "cast sweet desire" in her heart for the mortal Anchises, "to the end that, very soon, not even she should be innocent of a mortal's love." She disguised herself as a mortal maiden and came to him on Mount Ida. "By the will of the gods and destiny he lay with her, a mortal man with an immortal goddess, not clearly knowing what he did."[^hh5-anchises]

When she revealed her true form, Anchises was terrified: "he who lies with a deathless goddess is no hale man afterwards." Aphrodite reassured him and foretold their son: "His name shall be Aeneas, because I felt awful grief in that I laid me in the bed of mortal man." But she warned him never to reveal the truth, "lest Zeus will smite you in his anger with a smoking thunderbolt."[^hh5-aeneas]

She also lamented: "now my mouth shall no more have this power among the gods; for very great has been my madness, my miserable and dreadful madness."[^hh5-shame]

### Eos and Tithonus

In the Hymn, Aphrodite tells the story of [Eos](eos.md) and Tithonus as a cautionary tale. Eos asked [Zeus](zeus.md) for Tithonus's immortality but forgot to ask for eternal youth: "when loathsome old age pressed full upon him, and he could not move nor lift his limbs... she laid him in a room and put to the shining doors. There he babbles endlessly, and no more has strength at all."[^hh5-tithonus]

[^hh5-three]: "Yet there are three hearts that she cannot bend nor yet ensnare. First is the daughter of Zeus who holds the aegis, bright-eyed Athene... Nor does laughter-loving Aphrodite ever tame in love Artemis, the huntress with shafts of gold... Nor yet does the pure maiden Hestia love Aphrodite's works" (Homeric Hymn V to Aphrodite 7-32, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^hh5-power]: "of all others there is nothing among the blessed gods or among mortal men that has escaped Aphrodite. Even the heart of Zeus, who delights in thunder, is led astray by her" (Homeric Hymn V to Aphrodite 33-36)
[^hh5-anchises]: "upon Aphrodite herself Zeus cast sweet desire to be joined in love with a mortal man... by the will of the gods and destiny he lay with her, a mortal man with an immortal goddess, not clearly knowing what he did" (Homeric Hymn V to Aphrodite 45-167)
[^hh5-aeneas]: "His name shall be Aeneas, because I felt awful grief in that I laid me in the bed of mortal man... if you tell all and foolishly boast that you lay with rich-crowned Aphrodite, Zeus will smite you in his anger with a smoking thunderbolt" (Homeric Hymn V to Aphrodite 198-290)
[^hh5-shame]: "now my mouth shall no more have this power among the gods; for very great has been my madness, my miserable and dreadful madness, and I went astray out of my mind who have gotten a child beneath my girdle, mating with a mortal man" (Homeric Hymn V to Aphrodite 247-253)
[^hh5-tithonus]: "when loathsome old age pressed full upon him, and he could not move nor lift his limbs, this seemed to her in her heart the best counsel: she laid him in a room and put to the shining doors. There he babbles endlessly, and no more has strength at all, such as once he had in his supple limbs" (Homeric Hymn V to Aphrodite 233-238)

## In the Iliad

### Rescuing Paris (Book III)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book III, when Menelaos is about to kill Paris in single combat, "Zeus' daughter Aphrodite was swift to mark, and tore asunder for him the strap of slaughtered ox's hide; so the helmet came away empty in his stalwart hand." Then "Aphrodite snatched up Paris, very easily as a goddess may, and hid him in thick darkness, and sent him down in his fragrant perfumed chamber."[^il3-rescue]

### Summoning Helen

Aphrodite then goes to Helen "in the likeness of an aged dame, a woolcomber that was wont to work for her fair wool when she dwelt in Lakedaimon." But Helen sees through the disguise: "she marked the fair neck and lovely breast and sparkling eyes of the goddess, she marvelled straightway."[^il3-disguise]

Helen defies her: "Go and sit thou by his side, and depart from the way of the gods; neither let thy feet ever bear thee back to [Olympus](../places/olympus.md)." Aphrodite threatens her in return: "Provoke me not, rash woman, lest in mine anger I desert thee, and hate thee even as now I love thee beyond measure, and lest I devise grievous enmities between both, even betwixt Trojans and Achaians, and so thou perish in evil wise."[^il3-threat]

Helen obeys in fear. Aphrodite then serves her directly: "laughter-loving Aphrodite took for her a chair and brought it, even she the goddess, and set it before the face of Paris."[^il3-chair]

[^il3-rescue]: "Zeus' daughter Aphrodite was swift to mark, and tore asunder for him the strap of slaughtered ox's hide; so the helmet came away empty in his stalwart hand... Aphrodite snatched up Paris, very easily as a goddess may, and hid him in thick darkness, and sent him down in his fragrant perfumed chamber" (Iliad III.1975-1982, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il3-disguise]: "she marked the fair neck and lovely breast and sparkling eyes of the goddess, she marvelled straightway and spake a word and called upon her name: 'Strange queen, why art thou desirous now to beguile me?'" (Iliad III.1994-1996)
[^il3-threat]: "Provoke me not, rash woman, lest in mine anger I desert thee, and hate thee even as now I love thee beyond measure, and lest I devise grievous enmities between both, even betwixt Trojans and Achaians, and so thou perish in evil wise" (Iliad III.2009-2013)
[^il3-chair]: "laughter-loving Aphrodite took for her a chair and brought it, even she the goddess, and set it before the face of Paris" (Iliad III.2021-2022)

### Wounded by Diomedes / Ichor (Book V)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book V, Aphrodite shields her son Aeneas from Diomedes: "About her dear son wound she her white arms, and spread before his face a fold of her radiant vesture." But Diomedes, empowered by [Athena](athena.md), "thrust with his keen spear, and leapt on her and wounded the skin of her weak hand; straight through the ambrosial raiment that the [Graces](graces.md) themselves had woven her pierced the dart into the flesh."[^il5-wound]

Then flows "the goddess's immortal blood, such ichor as floweth in the blessed gods; for they eat no bread neither drink they gleaming wine, wherefore they are bloodless and are named immortals."[^il5-ichor]

She fled in pain to [Olympus](../places/olympus.md) and "fell upon Dione's knees that was her mother." [Zeus](zeus.md) told her gently: "Not unto thee, my child, are given the works of war; but follow thou after the loving tasks of wedlock, and to all these things shall fleet [Ares](ares.md) and Athene look."[^il5-zeus]

[^il5-wound]: "great-hearted Tydeus' son thrust with his keen spear, and leapt on her and wounded the skin of her weak hand; straight through the ambrosial raiment that the Graces themselves had woven her pierced the dart into the flesh, above the springing of the palm" (Iliad V.2913-2916, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il5-ichor]: "the goddess's immortal blood, such ichor as floweth in the blessed gods; for they eat no bread neither drink they gleaming wine, wherefore they are bloodless and are named immortals" (Iliad V.2917-2919)
[^il5-zeus]: "Not unto thee, my child, are given the works of war; but follow thou after the loving tasks of wedlock, and to all these things shall fleet Ares and Athene look" (Iliad V.3003-3005)

## Variant Traditions

### Birth from Uranus (Theogony) vs Daughter of Dione (Iliad)

Hesiod's account of Aphrodite's birth from [Uranus](uranus.md)'s severed members is one of two major traditions. The Iliad presents the other: in Book V, when Aphrodite is wounded, "fair Aphrodite fell upon Dione's knees that was her mother."[^il5-dione] Dione comforts her and speaks as her mother throughout the scene. [Zeus](zeus.md) also addresses Aphrodite as "my child," consistent with her being his daughter by Dione.

[^il5-dione]: "fair Aphrodite fell upon Dione's knees that was her mother. She took her daughter in her arms and stroked her with her hand" (Iliad V.2948-2949)
