## Overview

**Asteria** is a daughter of [Coeus](coeus.md) and [Phoebe](phoebe.md), sister of [Leto](leto.md), and mother of [Hecate](hecate.md) by Perses.

## Mythology

"Also she bare Asteria of happy name, whom Perses once led to his great house to be called his dear wife. And she conceived and bare [Hecate](hecate.md) whom [Zeus](zeus.md) the son of Cronos honoured above all."[^theog-asteria]

[^theog-asteria]: "Also she bare Asteria of happy name, whom Perses once led to his great house to be called his dear wife. And she conceived and bare Hecate whom Zeus the son of Cronos honoured above all" (Theogony 409-411, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## In the Bibliotheca

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) adds a vivid transformation story: "Asteria in the likeness of a quail flung herself into the sea in order to escape the amorous advances of Zeus, and a city was formerly called after her Asteria, but afterwards it was named Delos."[^apd-asteria]

> **NEW DETAIL:** The [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md) mentions only Asteria's marriage to Perses. The Bibliotheca adds her flight from [Zeus](zeus.md) in quail form and her transformation into the island of Delos — explaining both the island's name and its connection to [Leto](leto.md)'s story.

[^apd-asteria]: "Asteria in the likeness of a quail flung herself into the sea in order to escape the amorous advances of Zeus, and a city was formerly called after her Asteria, but afterwards it was named Delos." (Bibliotheca 1.4.1, trans. Frazer)
