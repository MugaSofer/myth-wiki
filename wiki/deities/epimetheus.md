## Overview

**Epimetheus** is a son of [Iapetus](iapetus.md), brother of [Prometheus](prometheus.md), described as "scatter-brained" and "a mischief to men."

## In the Theogony

"She [[Iapetus](iapetus.md)'s wife Clymene] bare very glorious Menoetius and clever [Prometheus](prometheus.md), full of various wiles, and scatter-brained Epimetheus who from the first was a mischief to men who eat bread; for it was he who first took of [Zeus](zeus.md) the woman, the maiden whom he had formed."[^theog-birth]

[^theog-birth]: "also she bare very glorious Menoetius and clever Prometheus, full of various wiles, and scatter-brained Epimetheus who from the first was a mischief to men who eat bread; for it was he who first took of Zeus the woman, the maiden whom he had formed" (Theogony 510-514, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## In Works and Days

"Epimetheus did not think on what [Prometheus](prometheus.md) had said to him, bidding him never take a gift of Olympian [Zeus](zeus.md), but to send it back for fear it might prove to be something harmful to men. But he took the gift, and afterwards, when the evil thing was already his, he understood."[^wd-pandora]
