## Overview

**Epimetheus** is a son of [Iapetus](iapetus.md), brother of [Prometheus](prometheus.md), described as "scatter-brained" and "a mischief to men."

## In the Theogony

"She [[Iapetus](iapetus.md)'s wife Clymene] bare very glorious Menoetius and clever [Prometheus](prometheus.md), full of various wiles, and scatter-brained Epimetheus who from the first was a mischief to men who eat bread; for it was he who first took of [Zeus](zeus.md) the woman, the maiden whom he had formed."[^theog-birth]

[^theog-birth]: "also she bare very glorious Menoetius and clever Prometheus, full of various wiles, and scatter-brained Epimetheus who from the first was a mischief to men who eat bread; for it was he who first took of Zeus the woman, the maiden whom he had formed" (Theogony 510-514, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## In Works and Days

"Epimetheus did not think on what [Prometheus](prometheus.md) had said to him, bidding him never take a gift of Olympian [Zeus](zeus.md), but to send it back for fear it might prove to be something harmful to men. But he took the gift, and afterwards, when the evil thing was already his, he understood."[^wd-pandora]

[^wd-pandora]: "Epimetheus did not think on what Prometheus had said to him, bidding him never take a gift of Olympian Zeus, but to send it back for fear it might prove to be something harmful to men. But he took the gift, and afterwards, when the evil thing was already his, he understood" (Works and Days 85-89, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## In the Bibliotheca

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) names Epimetheus and Pandora as parents of Pyrrha, "the first woman fashioned by the gods." Pyrrha married Deucalion (son of [Prometheus](prometheus.md)) and survived the great flood.[^apd-pyrrha]

[^apd-pyrrha]: "Pyrrha, the daughter of Epimetheus and Pandora, the first woman fashioned by the gods" (Bibliotheca 1.7.2, trans. Frazer)
