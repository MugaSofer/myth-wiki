## Variant Birth Traditions (Hymn I)

The [Homeric Hymn to Dionysus](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) (I) catalogues disputed birthplaces: "For some say, at Dracanum; and some, on windy Icarus; and some, in Naxos, O Heaven-born, Insewn; and others by the deep-eddying river Alpheus that pregnant Semele bare you to [Zeus](zeus.md) the thunder-lover. And others yet, lord, say you were born in Thebes; but all these lie. The Father of men and gods gave you birth remote from men and secretly from white-armed [Hera](hera.md). There is a certain Nysa, a mountain most high and richly grown with woods, far off in Phoenice."[^hh1-birth]

[^hh1-birth]: "For some say, at Dracanum; and some, on windy Icarus; and some, in Naxos, O Heaven-born, Insewn; and others by the deep-eddying river Alpheus that pregnant Semele bare you to Zeus the thunder-lover. And others yet, lord, say you were born in Thebes; but all these lie. The Father of men and gods gave you birth remote from men and secretly from white-armed Hera. There is a certain Nysa, a mountain most high and richly grown with woods, far off in Phoenice, near the streams of Aegyptus." (Homeric Hymn I to Dionysus 1-9, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Dionysus and the Pirates (Hymn VII)

[Homeric Hymn VII](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) tells how Tyrsenian pirates kidnapped Dionysus from a headland, "seeming like a stripling in the first flush of manhood." They "sought to bind him with rude bonds, but the bonds would not hold him, and the withes fell far away from his hands and feet: and he sat with a smile in his dark eyes."[^hh7-bonds]

The helmsman recognized the god and warned the crew, but the master ignored him. Then "sweet, fragrant wine ran streaming throughout all the black ship... a vine spread out both ways along the top of the sail with many clusters hanging down from it, and a dark ivy-plant twined about the mast." Dionysus "changed into a dreadful lion there on the ship" and created "a shaggy bear." The sailors "leapt out overboard one and all into the bright sea... and were changed into dolphins." Only the helmsman was spared.[^hh7-miracles]

Dionysus revealed himself: "I am loud-crying Dionysus whom Cadmus' daughter Semele bare of union with [Zeus](zeus.md)."[^hh7-reveal]

[^hh7-bonds]: "they sought to bind him with rude bonds, but the bonds would not hold him, and the withes fell far away from his hands and feet: and he sat with a smile in his dark eyes" (Homeric Hymn VII to Dionysus 12-15, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^hh7-miracles]: "sweet, fragrant wine ran streaming throughout all the black ship... a vine spread out both ways along the top of the sail with many clusters hanging down from it, and a dark ivy-plant twined about the mast... the god changed into a dreadful lion there on the ship... the sailors fled into the stern... they leapt out overboard one and all into the bright sea, escaping from a miserable fate, and were changed into dolphins" (Homeric Hymn VII to Dionysus 35-53)
[^hh7-reveal]: "I am loud-crying Dionysus whom Cadmus' daughter Semele bare of union with Zeus" (Homeric Hymn VII to Dionysus 56-57)

## In the Catalogue of Women

### The Gift of Wine (Fragment 87)

The Catalogue includes a striking saying about the double nature of Dionysus's gift: "Such gifts as Dionysus gave to men, a joy and a sorrow both. Who ever drinks to fullness, in him wine becomes violent and binds together his hands and feet, his tongue also and his wits with fetters unspeakable: and soft sleep embraces him."[^cat-wine]

[^cat-wine]: "Such gifts as Dionysus gave to men, a joy and a sorrow both. Who ever drinks to fullness, in him wine becomes violent and binds together his hands and feet, his tongue also and his wits with fetters unspeakable: and soft sleep embraces him" (Catalogue of Women, Fragment 87, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## In the Iliad

### Dionysus and Lykurgos (Book VI)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book VI, Diomedes tells the story of Lykurgos as a warning against fighting gods. Lykurgos "chased through the goodly land of Nysa the nursing-mothers of frenzied Dionysos; and they all cast their wands upon the ground, smitten with murderous Lykurgos' ox-goad. Then Dionysos fled and plunged beneath the salt sea-wave, and [Thetis](thetis.md) took him to her bosom, affrighted, for a mighty trembling had seized him at his foe's rebuke."[^il6-lykurgos]

The gods punished Lykurgos: "with Lykurgos the gods that live at ease were wroth, and Kronos' son made him blind, and he was not for long, because he was hated of all the immortal gods."[^il6-punishment]

This passage is notable for showing Dionysus in fear and flight — "affrighted" and "a mighty trembling" — and for his description as "frenzied Dionysos" whose followers are "nursing-mothers" carrying wands.

[^il6-lykurgos]: "he that erst chased through the goodly land of Nysa the nursing-mothers of frenzied Dionysos; and they all cast their wands upon the ground, smitten with murderous Lykurgos' ox-goad. Then Dionysos fled and plunged beneath the salt sea-wave, and Thetis took him to her bosom, affrighted, for a mighty trembling had seized him at his foe's rebuke" (Iliad VI.3581-3586, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il6-punishment]: "with Lykurgos the gods that live at ease were wroth, and Kronos' son made him blind, and he was not for long, because he was hated of all the immortal gods" (Iliad VI.3586-3588)

## In the Bibliotheca (1.6.2)

### Slaying Eurytus in the Gigantomachy

During the battle with the [Giants](../creatures/giants.md), "Eurytus was killed by Dionysus with a thyrsus."[^apd-dion-eurytus]

> **NEW DETAIL:** This is the only reference in our sources to Dionysus as a warrior. His weapon — the thyrsus, a staff tipped with ivy — is associated with his worship and revelry rather than combat.

[^apd-dion-eurytus]: "Eurytus was killed by Dionysus with a thyrsus" (Bibliotheca 1.6.2, trans. Frazer)

## In the Bibliotheca (2.2.2)

### Proetus's Daughters Go Mad

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) attributes the madness of Proetus's daughters to Dionysus: "When these damsels were grown up, they went mad, according to Hesiod, because they would not accept the rites of Dionysus."[^apd-dion-proetus] A variant cause is also given: "according to Acusilaus, because they disparaged the wooden image of [Hera](hera.md)."[^apd-dion-proetus-var]

In their madness, "they roamed over the whole Argive land, and afterwards, passing through Arcadia and the Peloponnese, they ran through the desert in the most disorderly fashion." The seer Melampus offered to cure them in exchange for a third of the sovereignty, and when Proetus refused the price, "the maidens raved more than ever, and besides that, the other women raved with them; for they also abandoned their houses, destroyed their own children, and flocked to the desert."[^apd-dion-madness] After Melampus's eventual cure, the eldest daughter Iphinoe perished in the pursuit, but the others recovered.

[^apd-dion-proetus]: "When these damsels were grown up, they went mad, according to Hesiod, because they would not accept the rites of Dionysus" (Bibliotheca 2.2.2, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-dion-proetus-var]: "according to Acusilaus, because they disparaged the wooden image of Hera" (Bibliotheca 2.2.2, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-dion-madness]: "the maidens raved more than ever, and besides that, the other women raved with them; for they also abandoned their houses, destroyed their own children, and flocked to the desert" (Bibliotheca 2.2.2, trans. J.G. Frazer)

## In the Bibliotheca (Book 3)

### Birth (3.4.3)

Zeus loved Semele and bedded with her secretly from [Hera](hera.md). He agreed to do whatever she asked, and Hera deceived her into asking that Zeus come to her as he came when wooing Hera. Unable to refuse, "Zeus came to her bridal chamber in a chariot, with lightnings and thunderings, and launched a thunderbolt. But Semele expired of fright."[^apd-semele-death] Zeus snatched the sixth-month child from the fire and sewed it in his thigh, and at the proper time "undid the stitches and gave birth to Dionysus, and entrusted him to [Hermes](hermes.md)."[^apd-dion-thigh]

Hermes conveyed the infant to Ino and Athamas, persuading them to rear him as a girl. But Hera drove them mad — Athamas hunted his son Learchus as a deer and killed him, and Ino threw her son Melicertes into a boiling cauldron, then sprang into the sea with the dead child (becoming Leucothea; the boy became Palaemon). Zeus eluded Hera's wrath by turning Dionysus into a kid, and Hermes brought him to the nymphs at Nysa in Asia, whom Zeus later changed into stars — the Hyades.[^apd-dion-ino]

### Wanderings (3.5.1-3.5.3)

Dionysus discovered the vine but was driven mad by Hera and roamed Egypt and Syria. He was purified by Rhea in Phrygia and learned the rites of initiation, then received the costume and set out through Thrace against the Indians.[^apd-dion-wander]

**Lycurgus**, king of the Edonians, was the first to insult and expel him. Dionysus took refuge in the sea with [Thetis](thetis.md), and the Bacchanals were captured along with his Satyrs. But the Bacchanals were suddenly released, and Dionysus drove Lycurgus mad: "in his madness he struck his son Dryas dead with an axe, imagining that he was lopping a branch of a vine." When the land remained barren, an oracle declared it would bear fruit only if Lycurgus died. The Edonians bound him on Mount Pangaeum, where "by the will of Dionysus he died, destroyed by horses."[^apd-dion-lycurgus]

At **[Thebes](../places/thebes.md)**, he forced the women to abandon their houses and rave in Bacchic frenzy on Cithaeron. **Pentheus**, who had succeeded [Cadmus](../heroes/cadmus.md) in the kingdom, tried to stop them and went to Cithaeron to spy. He was torn limb from limb by his own mother Agave, who thought he was a wild beast.[^apd-dion-pentheus]

At Argos, because they did not honor him, he again drove the women mad — "they on the mountains devoured the flesh of the infants whom they carried at their breasts."[^apd-dion-argos-book3]

### The Pirates (3.5.3)

Wishing to cross from Icaria to Naxos, Dionysus hired a pirate ship of Tyrrhenians. They sailed past Naxos intending to sell him, but "he turned the mast and oars into snakes, and filled the vessel with ivy and the sound of flutes. And the pirates went mad, and leaped into the sea, and were turned into dolphins."[^apd-dion-pirates]

### Rescuing Semele (3.5.3)

Having been recognized as a god, Dionysus brought his mother up from Hades, named her Thyone, and "ascended up with her to heaven."[^apd-dion-semele-rescue]

### Ariadne at Naxos (E.1.9)

When [Theseus](../heroes/theseus.md) arrived at Naxos with [Ariadne](../heroes/ariadne.md), "Dionysus fell in love with Ariadne and carried her off; and having brought her to Lemnos he enjoyed her, and begat Thoas, Staphylus, Oenopion, and Peparethus."[^apd-dion-ariadne]

[^apd-semele-death]: "Zeus came to her bridal chamber in a chariot, with lightnings and thunderings, and launched a thunderbolt. But Semele expired of fright" (Bibliotheca 3.4.3, trans. J.G. Frazer)

[^apd-dion-thigh]: "Zeus, snatching the sixth-month abortive child from the fire, sewed it in his thigh. On the death of Semele... at the proper time Zeus undid the stitches and gave birth to Dionysus, and entrusted him to Hermes" (Bibliotheca 3.4.3, trans. J.G. Frazer)

[^apd-dion-ino]: "Hera indignantly drove them mad, and Athamas hunted his elder son Learchus as a deer and killed him, and Ino threw Melicertes into a boiling cauldron... Zeus eluded the wrath of Hera by turning Dionysus into a kid, and Hermes took him and brought him to the nymphs who dwelt at Nysa in Asia, whom Zeus afterwards changed into stars and named them the Hyades" (Bibliotheca 3.4.3, trans. J.G. Frazer)

[^apd-dion-wander]: "Dionysus discovered the vine, and being driven mad by Hera he roamed about Egypt and Syria. At first he was received by Proteus, king of Egypt, but afterwards he arrived at Cybela in Phrygia. And there, after he had been purified by Rhea and learned the rites of initiation, he received from her the costume" (Bibliotheca 3.5.1, trans. J.G. Frazer)

[^apd-dion-lycurgus]: "in his madness he struck his son Dryas dead with an axe, imagining that he was lopping a branch of a vine, and when he had cut off his son's extremities, he recovered his senses... by the will of Dionysus he died, destroyed by horses" (Bibliotheca 3.5.1, trans. J.G. Frazer)

[^apd-dion-pentheus]: "coming to Cithaeron to spy on the Bacchanals, he was torn limb from limb by his mother Agave in a fit of madness; for she thought he was a wild beast" (Bibliotheca 3.5.2, trans. J.G. Frazer)

[^apd-dion-argos-book3]: "because they did not honor him, he drove the women mad, and they on the mountains devoured the flesh of the infants whom they carried at their breasts" (Bibliotheca 3.5.2, trans. J.G. Frazer)

[^apd-dion-pirates]: "he turned the mast and oars into snakes, and filled the vessel with ivy and the sound of flutes. And the pirates went mad, and leaped into the sea, and were turned into dolphins" (Bibliotheca 3.5.3, trans. J.G. Frazer)

[^apd-dion-semele-rescue]: "having brought up his mother from Hades and named her Thyone, he ascended up with her to heaven" (Bibliotheca 3.5.3, trans. J.G. Frazer)

[^apd-dion-ariadne]: "Dionysus fell in love with Ariadne and carried her off; and having brought her to Lemnos he enjoyed her, and begat Thoas, Staphylus, Oenopion, and Peparethus" (Epitome 1.9, trans. J.G. Frazer)
