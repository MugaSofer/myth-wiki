## Variant Birth Traditions (Hymn I)

The [Homeric Hymn to Dionysus](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) (I) catalogues disputed birthplaces: "For some say, at Dracanum; and some, on windy Icarus; and some, in Naxos, O Heaven-born, Insewn; and others by the deep-eddying river Alpheus that pregnant Semele bare you to [Zeus](zeus.md) the thunder-lover. And others yet, lord, say you were born in Thebes; but all these lie. The Father of men and gods gave you birth remote from men and secretly from white-armed [Hera](hera.md). There is a certain Nysa, a mountain most high and richly grown with woods, far off in Phoenice."[^hh1-birth]

[^hh1-birth]: "For some say, at Dracanum; and some, on windy Icarus; and some, in Naxos, O Heaven-born, Insewn; and others by the deep-eddying river Alpheus that pregnant Semele bare you to Zeus the thunder-lover. And others yet, lord, say you were born in Thebes; but all these lie. The Father of men and gods gave you birth remote from men and secretly from white-armed Hera. There is a certain Nysa, a mountain most high and richly grown with woods, far off in Phoenice, near the streams of Aegyptus." (Homeric Hymn I to Dionysus 1-9, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Dionysus and the Pirates (Hymn VII)

[Homeric Hymn VII](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) tells how Tyrsenian pirates kidnapped Dionysus from a headland, "seeming like a stripling in the first flush of manhood." They "sought to bind him with rude bonds, but the bonds would not hold him, and the withes fell far away from his hands and feet: and he sat with a smile in his dark eyes."[^hh7-bonds]

The helmsman recognized the god and warned the crew, but the master ignored him. Then "sweet, fragrant wine ran streaming throughout all the black ship... a vine spread out both ways along the top of the sail with many clusters hanging down from it, and a dark ivy-plant twined about the mast." Dionysus "changed into a dreadful lion there on the ship" and created "a shaggy bear." The sailors "leapt out overboard one and all into the bright sea... and were changed into dolphins." Only the helmsman was spared.[^hh7-miracles]

Dionysus revealed himself: "I am loud-crying Dionysus whom Cadmus' daughter Semele bare of union with [Zeus](zeus.md)."[^hh7-reveal]

[^hh7-bonds]: "they sought to bind him with rude bonds, but the bonds would not hold him, and the withes fell far away from his hands and feet: and he sat with a smile in his dark eyes" (Homeric Hymn VII to Dionysus 12-15, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^hh7-miracles]: "sweet, fragrant wine ran streaming throughout all the black ship... a vine spread out both ways along the top of the sail with many clusters hanging down from it, and a dark ivy-plant twined about the mast... the god changed into a dreadful lion there on the ship... the sailors fled into the stern... they leapt out overboard one and all into the bright sea, escaping from a miserable fate, and were changed into dolphins" (Homeric Hymn VII to Dionysus 35-53)
[^hh7-reveal]: "I am loud-crying Dionysus whom Cadmus' daughter Semele bare of union with Zeus" (Homeric Hymn VII to Dionysus 56-57)

## In the Fabulae

### Nysus (§131)

The [Fabulae](../sources/hyginus.md) tells of Dionysus's (Liber's) recovery of his Theban kingdom. "When Liber was leading his army into India, he gave the authority over his Theban kingdom to his nurse Nysus until he should come back."[^hyg-131-nysus] Upon return, "Nysus was unwilling to yield the kingdom."[^hyg-131-unwilling]

Dionysus used cunning: "Since Liber didn't want to quarrel with his nurse he permitted him to keep the kingdom until an opportunity should come to recover it."[^hyg-131-cunning] Three years later, "he made up the quarrel with him, and pretended he wanted to celebrate in the state the sacred rites termed Trieteric, because he performed them after the third year."[^hyg-131-trieteric]

The stratagem succeeded: "He introduced soldiers as Bacchanals in women's dress, captured Nysus, and recovered his kingdom."[^hyg-131-soldiers]

[^hyg-131-nysus]: "When Liber was leading his army into India, he gave the authority over his Theban kingdom to his nurse Nysus until he should come back." (Fabulae §131, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-131-unwilling]: "But after Liber returned from there, Nysus was unwilling to yield the kingdom." (Fabulae §131, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-131-cunning]: "Since Liber didn't want to quarrel with his nurse he permitted him to keep the kingdom until an opportunity should come to recover it." (Fabulae §131, trans. Mary Grant)

[^hyg-131-soldiers]: "He introduced soldiers as Bacchanals in women's dress, captured Nysus, and recovered his kingdom." (Fabulae §131, trans. Mary Grant)

### Lycurgus (§132)

Lycurgus challenged Dionysus's divinity. "Lycurgus, son of Dryas, drove Liber from his kingdom."[^hyg-132-drove] His blasphemy was deliberate: "When he denied that Liber was a god, and had drunk wine, and in drunkenness tried to violate his mother, he then tried to cut down the vines, because he said wine was a bad medicine in that it affected the mind."[^hyg-132-deny]

Punishment came through madness: "Under madness sent by Liber he killed his wife and son."[^hyg-132-madness] His death was violent: "Liber threw Lycurgus himself to his panthers on Rhodope, a mountain of Thrace, over which he ruled."[^hyg-132-panthers] The madness persisted: "He is said to have cut off one foot thinking it was a vine."[^hyg-132-foot]

[^hyg-132-drove]: "Lycurgus, son of Dryas, drove Liber from his kingdom." (Fabulae §132, trans. Mary Grant)

[^hyg-132-foot]: "He is said to have cut off one foot thinking it was a vine." (Fabulae §132, trans. Mary Grant)

### Tyrrhenian Pirates (§134)

The Fabulae recounts Dionysus's encounter with pirates. "When the Tyrrhenians, later called Tuscans, were on a piratical expedition, Father Liber, then a youth, came on their ship and asked them to take him to Naxos."[^hyg-134-youth] The pirates had evil intent: "When they had taken him on and wished to debauch him because of his beauty, Acoetes, the pilot, restrained them, and suffered at their hands."[^hyg-134-acoetes]

Dionysus revealed his power: "Liber, seeing that their purpose remained the same, changed the oars to thyrsi, the sails to vine-leaves, the ropes to ivy; then lions and panthers leapt out."[^hyg-134-changed]

The transformation was complete: "When they saw them, in fear they cast themselves into the sea, and even in the sea he changed them to a sort of beast. For whoever leaped overboard was changed into dolphin shape, and from this dolphins are called Tyrrhenians, and the sea Tyrrhenian."[^hyg-134-dolphins]

The crew numbered twelve, with only Acoetes saved: "The last was the pilot, whom Liber saved out of kindness."[^hyg-134-saved]

[^hyg-134-youth]: "When the Tyrrhenians, later called Tuscans, were on a piratical expedition, Father Liber, then a youth, came on their ship and asked them to take him to Naxos." (Fabulae §134, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-134-acoetes]: "When they had taken him on and wished to debauch him because of his beauty, Acoetes, the pilot, restrained them, and suffered at their hands." (Fabulae §134, trans. Mary Grant)

[^hyg-134-dolphins]: "When they saw them, in fear they cast themselves into the sea, and even in the sea he changed them to a sort of beast. For whoever leaped overboard was changed into dolphin shape, and from this dolphins are called Tyrrhenians, and the sea Tyrrhenian." (Fabulae §134, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-134-saved]: "They were twelve in number with the following names... The last was the pilot, whom Liber saved out of kindness." (Fabulae §134, trans. Mary Grant)

### Birth from Semele (§167)

The Fabulae preserves a unique variant of Dionysus's birth. "Liber, son of Jove [[Zeus](zeus.md)] and Proserpine [[Persephone](persephone.md)], was dismembered by the Titans, and Jove gave his heart, torn to bits, to Semele in a drink."[^hyg-167-heart] This led to conception: "When she was made pregnant by this, Juno [[Hera](hera.md)], changing herself to look like Semele's nurse, Beroe, said to her: 'Daughter, ask Jove to come to you as he comes to Juno, so you may know what pleasure it is to sleep with a god.'"[^hyg-167-beroe]

The fatal request: "At her suggestion Semele made this request of Jove, and was smitten by a thunderbolt."[^hyg-167-thunderbolt] Zeus saved the child: "He took Liber from her womb, and gave him to Nysus to be cared for."[^hyg-167-nysus]

The dual nature of the god: "For this reason he is called Dionysus, and also 'the one with two mothers.'"[^hyg-167-mothers]

> **VARIANT:** This is radically different from standard tradition. Dionysus is usually Zeus and Semele's son from the beginning, not a resurrected Titan-slain son of Zeus and Persephone whose heart was given to Semele.

[^hyg-167-heart]: "Liber, son of Jove and Proserpine, was dismembered by the Titans, and Jove gave his heart, torn to bits, to Semele in a drink." (Fabulae §167, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-167-beroe]: "When she was made pregnant by this, Juno, changing herself to look like Semele's nurse, Beroe, said to her: 'Daughter, ask Jove to come to you as he comes to Juno, so you may know what pleasure it is to sleep with a god.'" (Fabulae §167, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-167-thunderbolt]: "At her suggestion Semele made this request of Jove, and was smitten by a thunderbolt." (Fabulae §167, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-167-nysus]: "He took Liber from her womb, and gave him to Nysus to be cared for." (Fabulae §167, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-167-mothers]: "For this reason he is called Dionysus, and also 'the one with two mothers.'" (Fabulae §167, trans. Mary Grant)

### Semele (§179)

The Fabulae also gives the more standard version. "[Zeus](zeus.md) (Jove) desired to lie with Semele, and when Juno [[Hera](hera.md)] found out, she changed her form to that of the nurse Beroe, came to Semele, and suggested that she ask Jove to come to her as he came to Juno."[^hyg-179-suggestion]

The request and result: "'that you may know', she said, 'what pleasure it is to lie with a god.' And so Semele asked Jove to come to her in this way. Her request was granted, and Jove, coming with lightning and thunder, burned Semele to death."[^hyg-179-burned]

Zeus saved the child: "From her womb Liber was born. Mercury [[Hermes](hermes.md)] snatched him from the fire and gave him to Nysus to be reared. In Greek he is called Dionysus."[^hyg-179-greek]

[^hyg-179-suggestion]: "Jove desired to lie with Semele, and when Juno found out, she changed her form to that of the nurse Beroe, came to Semele, and suggested that she ask Jove to come to her as he came to Juno." (Fabulae §179, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-179-burned]: "'that you may know', she said, 'what pleasure it is to lie with a god.' And so Semele asked Jove to come to her in this way. Her request was granted, and Jove, coming with lightning and thunder, burned Semele to death." (Fabulae §179, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-179-greek]: "From her womb Liber was born. Mercury snatched him from the fire and gave him to Nysus to be reared. In Greek he is called Dionysus." (Fabulae §179, trans. Mary Grant)

## In the Catalogue of Women

### The Gift of Wine (Fragment 87)

The Catalogue includes a striking saying about the double nature of Dionysus's gift: "Such gifts as Dionysus gave to men, a joy and a sorrow both. Who ever drinks to fullness, in him wine becomes violent and binds together his hands and feet, his tongue also and his wits with fetters unspeakable: and soft sleep embraces him."[^cat-wine]

[^cat-wine]: "Such gifts as Dionysus gave to men, a joy and a sorrow both. Who ever drinks to fullness, in him wine becomes violent and binds together his hands and feet, his tongue also and his wits with fetters unspeakable: and soft sleep embraces him" (Catalogue of Women, Fragment 87, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## In the Iliad

### Dionysus and Lykurgos (Book VI)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book VI, Diomedes tells the story of Lykurgos as a warning against fighting gods. Lykurgos "chased through the goodly land of Nysa the nursing-mothers of frenzied Dionysos; and they all cast their wands upon the ground, smitten with murderous Lykurgos' ox-goad. Then Dionysos fled and plunged beneath the salt sea-wave, and [Thetis](thetis.md) took him to her bosom, affrighted, for a mighty trembling had seized him at his foe's rebuke."[^il6-lykurgos]

The gods punished Lykurgos: "with Lykurgos the gods that live at ease were wroth, and Kronos' son made him blind, and he was not for long, because he was hated of all the immortal gods."[^il6-punishment]

This passage is notable for showing Dionysus in fear and flight — "affrighted" and "a mighty trembling" — and for his description as "frenzied Dionysos" whose followers are "nursing-mothers" carrying wands.

[^il6-lykurgos]: "he that erst chased through the goodly land of Nysa the nursing-mothers of frenzied Dionysos; and they all cast their wands upon the ground, smitten with murderous Lykurgos' ox-goad. Then Dionysos fled and plunged beneath the salt sea-wave, and Thetis took him to her bosom, affrighted, for a mighty trembling had seized him at his foe's rebuke" (Iliad VI.3581-3586, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il6-punishment]: "with Lykurgos the gods that live at ease were wroth, and Kronos' son made him blind, and he was not for long, because he was hated of all the immortal gods" (Iliad VI.3586-3588)

## In the Bibliotheca (1.6.2)

### Slaying Eurytus in the Gigantomachy

During the battle with the [Giants](../creatures/giants.md), "Eurytus was killed by Dionysus with a thyrsus."[^apd-dion-eurytus]

> **NEW DETAIL:** This is the only reference in our sources to Dionysus as a warrior. His weapon — the thyrsus, a staff tipped with ivy — is associated with his worship and revelry rather than combat.

[^apd-dion-eurytus]: "Eurytus was killed by Dionysus with a thyrsus" (Bibliotheca 1.6.2, trans. Frazer)

## In the Bibliotheca (2.2.2)

### Proetus's Daughters Go Mad

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) attributes the madness of Proetus's daughters to Dionysus: "When these damsels were grown up, they went mad, according to Hesiod, because they would not accept the rites of Dionysus."[^apd-dion-proetus] A variant cause is also given: "according to Acusilaus, because they disparaged the wooden image of [Hera](hera.md)."[^apd-dion-proetus-var]

In their madness, "they roamed over the whole Argive land, and afterwards, passing through Arcadia and the Peloponnese, they ran through the desert in the most disorderly fashion." The seer Melampus offered to cure them in exchange for a third of the sovereignty, and when Proetus refused the price, "the maidens raved more than ever, and besides that, the other women raved with them; for they also abandoned their houses, destroyed their own children, and flocked to the desert."[^apd-dion-madness] After Melampus's eventual cure, the eldest daughter Iphinoe perished in the pursuit, but the others recovered.

[^apd-dion-proetus]: "When these damsels were grown up, they went mad, according to Hesiod, because they would not accept the rites of Dionysus" (Bibliotheca 2.2.2, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-dion-proetus-var]: "according to Acusilaus, because they disparaged the wooden image of Hera" (Bibliotheca 2.2.2, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-dion-madness]: "the maidens raved more than ever, and besides that, the other women raved with them; for they also abandoned their houses, destroyed their own children, and flocked to the desert" (Bibliotheca 2.2.2, trans. J.G. Frazer)

## In the Bibliotheca (Book 3)

### Birth (3.4.3)

Zeus loved Semele and bedded with her secretly from [Hera](hera.md). He agreed to do whatever she asked, and Hera deceived her into asking that Zeus come to her as he came when wooing Hera. Unable to refuse, "Zeus came to her bridal chamber in a chariot, with lightnings and thunderings, and launched a thunderbolt. But Semele expired of fright."[^apd-semele-death] Zeus snatched the sixth-month child from the fire and sewed it in his thigh, and at the proper time "undid the stitches and gave birth to Dionysus, and entrusted him to [Hermes](hermes.md)."[^apd-dion-thigh]

Hermes conveyed the infant to Ino and Athamas, persuading them to rear him as a girl. But Hera drove them mad — Athamas hunted his son Learchus as a deer and killed him, and Ino threw her son Melicertes into a boiling cauldron, then sprang into the sea with the dead child (becoming Leucothea; the boy became Palaemon). Zeus eluded Hera's wrath by turning Dionysus into a kid, and Hermes brought him to the nymphs at Nysa in Asia, whom Zeus later changed into stars — the Hyades.[^apd-dion-ino]

### Wanderings (3.5.1-3.5.3)

Dionysus discovered the vine but was driven mad by Hera and roamed Egypt and Syria. He was purified by Rhea in Phrygia and learned the rites of initiation, then received the costume and set out through Thrace against the Indians.[^apd-dion-wander]

**Lycurgus**, king of the Edonians, was the first to insult and expel him. Dionysus took refuge in the sea with [Thetis](thetis.md), and the Bacchanals were captured along with his Satyrs. But the Bacchanals were suddenly released, and Dionysus drove Lycurgus mad: "in his madness he struck his son Dryas dead with an axe, imagining that he was lopping a branch of a vine." When the land remained barren, an oracle declared it would bear fruit only if Lycurgus died. The Edonians bound him on Mount Pangaeum, where "by the will of Dionysus he died, destroyed by horses."[^apd-dion-lycurgus]

At **[Thebes](../places/thebes.md)**, he forced the women to abandon their houses and rave in Bacchic frenzy on Cithaeron. **Pentheus**, who had succeeded [Cadmus](../heroes/cadmus.md) in the kingdom, tried to stop them and went to Cithaeron to spy. He was torn limb from limb by his own mother Agave, who thought he was a wild beast.[^apd-dion-pentheus]

At Argos, because they did not honor him, he again drove the women mad — "they on the mountains devoured the flesh of the infants whom they carried at their breasts."[^apd-dion-argos-book3]

### The Pirates (3.5.3)

Wishing to cross from Icaria to Naxos, Dionysus hired a pirate ship of Tyrrhenians. They sailed past Naxos intending to sell him, but "he turned the mast and oars into snakes, and filled the vessel with ivy and the sound of flutes. And the pirates went mad, and leaped into the sea, and were turned into dolphins."[^apd-dion-pirates]

### Rescuing Semele (3.5.3)

Having been recognized as a god, Dionysus brought his mother up from Hades, named her Thyone, and "ascended up with her to heaven."[^apd-dion-semele-rescue]

### Ariadne at Naxos (E.1.9)

When [Theseus](../heroes/theseus.md) arrived at Naxos with [Ariadne](../heroes/ariadne.md), "Dionysus fell in love with Ariadne and carried her off; and having brought her to Lemnos he enjoyed her, and begat Thoas, Staphylus, Oenopion, and Peparethus."[^apd-dion-ariadne]

[^apd-semele-death]: "Zeus came to her bridal chamber in a chariot, with lightnings and thunderings, and launched a thunderbolt. But Semele expired of fright" (Bibliotheca 3.4.3, trans. J.G. Frazer)

[^apd-dion-thigh]: "Zeus, snatching the sixth-month abortive child from the fire, sewed it in his thigh. On the death of Semele... at the proper time Zeus undid the stitches and gave birth to Dionysus, and entrusted him to Hermes" (Bibliotheca 3.4.3, trans. J.G. Frazer)

[^apd-dion-ino]: "Hera indignantly drove them mad, and Athamas hunted his elder son Learchus as a deer and killed him, and Ino threw Melicertes into a boiling cauldron... Zeus eluded the wrath of Hera by turning Dionysus into a kid, and Hermes took him and brought him to the nymphs who dwelt at Nysa in Asia, whom Zeus afterwards changed into stars and named them the Hyades" (Bibliotheca 3.4.3, trans. J.G. Frazer)

[^apd-dion-wander]: "Dionysus discovered the vine, and being driven mad by Hera he roamed about Egypt and Syria. At first he was received by Proteus, king of Egypt, but afterwards he arrived at Cybela in Phrygia. And there, after he had been purified by Rhea and learned the rites of initiation, he received from her the costume" (Bibliotheca 3.5.1, trans. J.G. Frazer)

[^apd-dion-lycurgus]: "in his madness he struck his son Dryas dead with an axe, imagining that he was lopping a branch of a vine, and when he had cut off his son's extremities, he recovered his senses... by the will of Dionysus he died, destroyed by horses" (Bibliotheca 3.5.1, trans. J.G. Frazer)

[^apd-dion-pentheus]: "coming to Cithaeron to spy on the Bacchanals, he was torn limb from limb by his mother Agave in a fit of madness; for she thought he was a wild beast" (Bibliotheca 3.5.2, trans. J.G. Frazer)

[^apd-dion-argos-book3]: "because they did not honor him, he drove the women mad, and they on the mountains devoured the flesh of the infants whom they carried at their breasts" (Bibliotheca 3.5.2, trans. J.G. Frazer)

[^apd-dion-pirates]: "he turned the mast and oars into snakes, and filled the vessel with ivy and the sound of flutes. And the pirates went mad, and leaped into the sea, and were turned into dolphins" (Bibliotheca 3.5.3, trans. J.G. Frazer)

[^apd-dion-semele-rescue]: "having brought up his mother from Hades and named her Thyone, he ascended up with her to heaven" (Bibliotheca 3.5.3, trans. J.G. Frazer)

[^apd-dion-ariadne]: "Dionysus fell in love with Ariadne and carried her off; and having brought her to Lemnos he enjoyed her, and begat Thoas, Staphylus, Oenopion, and Peparethus" (Epitome 1.9, trans. J.G. Frazer)
