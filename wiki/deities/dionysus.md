## Variant Birth Traditions (Hymn I)

The [Homeric Hymn to Dionysus](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) (I) catalogues disputed birthplaces: "For some say, at Dracanum; and some, on windy Icarus; and some, in Naxos, O Heaven-born, Insewn; and others by the deep-eddying river Alpheus that pregnant Semele bare you to [Zeus](zeus.md) the thunder-lover. And others yet, lord, say you were born in Thebes; but all these lie. The Father of men and gods gave you birth remote from men and secretly from white-armed [Hera](hera.md). There is a certain Nysa, a mountain most high and richly grown with woods, far off in Phoenice."[^hh1-birth]

[^hh1-birth]: "For some say, at Dracanum; and some, on windy Icarus; and some, in Naxos, O Heaven-born, Insewn; and others by the deep-eddying river Alpheus that pregnant Semele bare you to Zeus the thunder-lover. And others yet, lord, say you were born in Thebes; but all these lie. The Father of men and gods gave you birth remote from men and secretly from white-armed Hera. There is a certain Nysa, a mountain most high and richly grown with woods, far off in Phoenice, near the streams of Aegyptus." (Homeric Hymn I to Dionysus 1-9, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Dionysus and the Pirates (Hymn VII)

[Homeric Hymn VII](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) tells how Tyrsenian pirates kidnapped Dionysus from a headland, "seeming like a stripling in the first flush of manhood." They "sought to bind him with rude bonds, but the bonds would not hold him, and the withes fell far away from his hands and feet: and he sat with a smile in his dark eyes."[^hh7-bonds]

The helmsman recognized the god and warned the crew, but the master ignored him. Then "sweet, fragrant wine ran streaming throughout all the black ship... a vine spread out both ways along the top of the sail with many clusters hanging down from it, and a dark ivy-plant twined about the mast." Dionysus "changed into a dreadful lion there on the ship" and created "a shaggy bear." The sailors "leapt out overboard one and all into the bright sea... and were changed into dolphins." Only the helmsman was spared.[^hh7-miracles]

Dionysus revealed himself: "I am loud-crying Dionysus whom Cadmus' daughter Semele bare of union with [Zeus](zeus.md)."[^hh7-reveal]

[^hh7-bonds]: "they sought to bind him with rude bonds, but the bonds would not hold him, and the withes fell far away from his hands and feet: and he sat with a smile in his dark eyes" (Homeric Hymn VII to Dionysus 12-15, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^hh7-miracles]: "sweet, fragrant wine ran streaming throughout all the black ship... a vine spread out both ways along the top of the sail with many clusters hanging down from it, and a dark ivy-plant twined about the mast... the god changed into a dreadful lion there on the ship... the sailors fled into the stern... they leapt out overboard one and all into the bright sea, escaping from a miserable fate, and were changed into dolphins" (Homeric Hymn VII to Dionysus 35-53)
[^hh7-reveal]: "I am loud-crying Dionysus whom Cadmus' daughter Semele bare of union with Zeus" (Homeric Hymn VII to Dionysus 56-57)

## In the Iliad

### Dionysus and Lykurgos (Book VI)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book VI, Diomedes tells the story of Lykurgos as a warning against fighting gods. Lykurgos "chased through the goodly land of Nysa the nursing-mothers of frenzied Dionysos; and they all cast their wands upon the ground, smitten with murderous Lykurgos' ox-goad. Then Dionysos fled and plunged beneath the salt sea-wave, and [Thetis](thetis.md) took him to her bosom, affrighted, for a mighty trembling had seized him at his foe's rebuke."[^il6-lykurgos]

The gods punished Lykurgos: "with Lykurgos the gods that live at ease were wroth, and Kronos' son made him blind, and he was not for long, because he was hated of all the immortal gods."[^il6-punishment]

This passage is notable for showing Dionysus in fear and flight — "affrighted" and "a mighty trembling" — and for his description as "frenzied Dionysos" whose followers are "nursing-mothers" carrying wands.

[^il6-lykurgos]: "he that erst chased through the goodly land of Nysa the nursing-mothers of frenzied Dionysos; and they all cast their wands upon the ground, smitten with murderous Lykurgos' ox-goad. Then Dionysos fled and plunged beneath the salt sea-wave, and Thetis took him to her bosom, affrighted, for a mighty trembling had seized him at his foe's rebuke" (Iliad VI.3581-3586, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il6-punishment]: "with Lykurgos the gods that live at ease were wroth, and Kronos' son made him blind, and he was not for long, because he was hated of all the immortal gods" (Iliad VI.3586-3588)

## In the Bibliotheca (1.6.2)

### Slaying Eurytus in the Gigantomachy

During the battle with the [Giants](../creatures/giants.md), "Eurytus was killed by Dionysus with a thyrsus."[^apd-dion-eurytus]

> **NEW DETAIL:** This is the only reference in our sources to Dionysus as a warrior. His weapon — the thyrsus, a staff tipped with ivy — is associated with his worship and revelry rather than combat.

[^apd-dion-eurytus]: "Eurytus was killed by Dionysus with a thyrsus" (Bibliotheca 1.6.2, trans. Frazer)

## In the Bibliotheca (2.2.2)

### Proetus's Daughters Go Mad

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) attributes the madness of Proetus's daughters to Dionysus: "When these damsels were grown up, they went mad, according to Hesiod, because they would not accept the rites of Dionysus."[^apd-dion-proetus] A variant cause is also given: "according to Acusilaus, because they disparaged the wooden image of [Hera](hera.md)."[^apd-dion-proetus-var]

In their madness, "they roamed over the whole Argive land, and afterwards, passing through Arcadia and the Peloponnese, they ran through the desert in the most disorderly fashion." The seer Melampus offered to cure them in exchange for a third of the sovereignty, and when Proetus refused the price, "the maidens raved more than ever, and besides that, the other women raved with them; for they also abandoned their houses, destroyed their own children, and flocked to the desert."[^apd-dion-madness] After Melampus's eventual cure, the eldest daughter Iphinoe perished in the pursuit, but the others recovered.

[^apd-dion-proetus]: "When these damsels were grown up, they went mad, according to Hesiod, because they would not accept the rites of Dionysus" (Bibliotheca 2.2.2, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-dion-proetus-var]: "according to Acusilaus, because they disparaged the wooden image of Hera" (Bibliotheca 2.2.2, trans. J.G. Frazer)
