## Variant Birth Traditions (Hymn I)

The [Homeric Hymn to Dionysus](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) (I) catalogues disputed birthplaces: "For some say, at Dracanum; and some, on windy Icarus; and some, in Naxos, O Heaven-born, Insewn; and others by the deep-eddying river Alpheus that pregnant Semele bare you to [Zeus](zeus.md) the thunder-lover. And others yet, lord, say you were born in Thebes; but all these lie. The Father of men and gods gave you birth remote from men and secretly from white-armed [Hera](hera.md). There is a certain Nysa, a mountain most high and richly grown with woods, far off in Phoenice."[^hh1-birth]

[^hh1-birth]: "For some say, at Dracanum; and some, on windy Icarus; and some, in Naxos, O Heaven-born, Insewn; and others by the deep-eddying river Alpheus that pregnant Semele bare you to Zeus the thunder-lover. And others yet, lord, say you were born in Thebes; but all these lie. The Father of men and gods gave you birth remote from men and secretly from white-armed Hera. There is a certain Nysa, a mountain most high and richly grown with woods, far off in Phoenice, near the streams of Aegyptus." (Homeric Hymn I to Dionysus 1-9, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Dionysus and the Pirates (Hymn VII)

[Homeric Hymn VII](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) tells how Tyrsenian pirates kidnapped Dionysus from a headland, "seeming like a stripling in the first flush of manhood." They "sought to bind him with rude bonds, but the bonds would not hold him, and the withes fell far away from his hands and feet: and he sat with a smile in his dark eyes."[^hh7-bonds]

The helmsman recognized the god and warned the crew, but the master ignored him. Then "sweet, fragrant wine ran streaming throughout all the black ship... a vine spread out both ways along the top of the sail with many clusters hanging down from it, and a dark ivy-plant twined about the mast." Dionysus "changed into a dreadful lion there on the ship" and created "a shaggy bear." The sailors "leapt out overboard one and all into the bright sea... and were changed into dolphins." Only the helmsman was spared.[^hh7-miracles]

Dionysus revealed himself: "I am loud-crying Dionysus whom Cadmus' daughter Semele bare of union with [Zeus](zeus.md)."[^hh7-reveal]

[^hh7-bonds]: "they sought to bind him with rude bonds, but the bonds would not hold him, and the withes fell far away from his hands and feet: and he sat with a smile in his dark eyes" (Homeric Hymn VII to Dionysus 12-15, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^hh7-miracles]: "sweet, fragrant wine ran streaming throughout all the black ship... a vine spread out both ways along the top of the sail with many clusters hanging down from it, and a dark ivy-plant twined about the mast... the god changed into a dreadful lion there on the ship... the sailors fled into the stern... they leapt out overboard one and all into the bright sea, escaping from a miserable fate, and were changed into dolphins" (Homeric Hymn VII to Dionysus 35-53)
[^hh7-reveal]: "I am loud-crying Dionysus whom Cadmus' daughter Semele bare of union with Zeus" (Homeric Hymn VII to Dionysus 56-57)
