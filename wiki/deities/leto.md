## Birth of Apollo and Artemis (Theogony)

"Leto was joined in love with [Zeus](zeus.md) who holds the aegis, and bare [Apollo](apollo.md) and [Artemis](artemis.md) delighting in arrows, children lovely above all the sons of Heaven."[^theog-birth]

[^theog-birth]: "Leto was joined in love with Zeus who holds the aegis, and bare Apollo and Artemis delighting in arrows, children lovely above all the sons of Heaven" (Theogony 918-920, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Birth of Apollo on Delos (Hymn to Apollo)

The [Homeric Hymn to Apollo](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) (III) tells of Leto's wandering search for a birthplace. No land would receive her, for "they greatly trembled and feared, and none, not even the richest of them, dared receive Phoebus." Only Delos agreed, after Leto swore an oath that [Apollo](apollo.md) would build his first temple there.[^hh3-delos]

[Hera](hera.md) kept [Eileithyia](eileithyia.md) (goddess of childbirth) away "through envy, because Leto with the lovely tresses was soon to bear a son faultless and strong." The other goddesses sent [Iris](iris.md) to fetch her. When Eileithyia arrived, "the pains of birth seized Leto, and she longed to bring forth; so she cast her arms about a palm tree and kneeled on the soft meadow while the earth laughed for joy beneath. Then the child leaped forth to the light."[^hh3-birth]

After the birth, [Themis](themis.md) fed the newborn: "Leto did not give Apollo, bearer of the golden blade, her breast; but Themis duly poured nectar and ambrosia."[^hh3-themis]

[^hh3-delos]: "they greatly trembled and feared, and none, not even the richest of them, dared receive Phoebus, until queenly Leto set foot on Delos and uttered winged words" (Homeric Hymn III to Apollo 46-49, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^hh3-birth]: "the pains of birth seized Leto, and she longed to bring forth; so she cast her arms about a palm tree and kneeled on the soft meadow while the earth laughed for joy beneath. Then the child leaped forth to the light, and all the goddesses washed you purely and cleanly with sweet water" (Homeric Hymn III to Apollo 115-120)
[^hh3-themis]: "Leto did not give Apollo, bearer of the golden blade, her breast; but Themis duly poured nectar and ambrosia" (Homeric Hymn III to Apollo 123-124, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## On Olympus

When [Apollo](apollo.md) enters the hall of [Zeus](zeus.md), "the gods tremble before him and all spring up from their seats when he draws near, as he bends his bright bow. But Leto alone stays by the side of Zeus who delights in thunder."[^hh3-olympus]

After [Artemis](artemis.md) hunts, she goes to Apollo's house at Delphi to lead the dances, "while all they utter their heavenly voice, singing how neat-ankled Leto bare children supreme among the immortals."[^hh27-delphi]

[^hh3-olympus]: "As he goes through the house of Zeus, the gods tremble before him and all spring up from their seats when he draws near, as he bends his bright bow. But Leto alone stays by the side of Zeus who delights in thunder" (Homeric Hymn III to Apollo 2-7)
[^hh27-delphi]: "this huntress who delights in arrows slackens her supple bow and goes to the great house of her dear brother Phoebus Apollo, to the rich land of Delphi, there to order the lovely dance of the Muses and Graces. There she hangs up her curved bow and her arrows, and heads and leads the dances" (Homeric Hymn XXVII to Artemis 12-18)

## In the Iliad

### Healing Aeneas (Book V)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book V, after [Apollo](apollo.md) shields Aeneas from Diomedes and places him in his temple, Leto and [Artemis](artemis.md) heal him there.[^il5-heal]

[^il5-heal]: Leto and Artemis heal Aeneas in Apollo's temple (Iliad V, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

### Among Zeus's Loves (Book XIV)

[Zeus](zeus.md) names Leto among his past loves when overcome by desire for [Hera](hera.md): "nor when I loved the fair-tressed queen, [Demeter](demeter.md), nor renowned Leto, nay, nor thy very self, as now I love thee, and sweet desire possesses me."[^il14-loves]

[^il14-loves]: "nor when I loved the fair-tressed queen, Demeter, nor renowned Leto, nay, nor thy very self, as now I love thee, and sweet desire possesses me" (Iliad XIV.8510-8520, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

### Patroklos's Dying Words (Book XVI)

Patroklos acknowledges [Apollo](apollo.md) as his true slayer: "me have ruinous Fate and the son of Leto slain, and of men Euphorbos, but thou art the third in my slaying."[^il16-dying]

[^il16-dying]: "me have ruinous Fate and the son of Leto slain, and of men Euphorbos, but thou art the third in my slaying" (Iliad XVI.9988)

### The Theomachy (Books XX-XXI)

In Book XX, when [Zeus](zeus.md) unleashes all the gods to fight on both sides, Leto is listed on the Trojan side alongside [Ares](ares.md), [Apollo](apollo.md), [Artemis](artemis.md), Xanthos, and [Aphrodite](aphrodite.md).[^il20-sides]

In Book XXI, [Hermes](hermes.md) is matched against Leto in the Theomachy but declines to fight her: "a grievous thing it is to come to blows with wives of cloud-gathering Zeus."[^il21-hermes]

In the same episode, [Hera](hera.md) beats [Artemis](artemis.md) with her own bow, and Artemis flees weeping to [Zeus](zeus.md)'s knee.[^il21-artemis]

[^il20-sides]: Theomachy — Zeus unleashes both sides (Trojan: Ares, Apollo, Artemis, Leto, Xanthos, Aphrodite) (Iliad XX, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il21-hermes]: "a grievous thing it is to come to blows with wives of cloud-gathering Zeus" (Iliad XXI, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il21-artemis]: Hera beats Artemis with her own bow; Artemis flees weeping to Zeus's knee (Iliad XXI, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

### The Niobe Story (Book XXIV)

In Achilles' account of Niobe, her children were slain for rivalling Leto: "Apollo slew the sons with arrows from his silver bow, being angered with Niobe, and shaft-showering [Artemis](artemis.md) slew the daughters."[^il24-niobe] Niobe had "matched herself against Leto," claiming superiority in children.[^il24-matched]

[^il24-niobe]: "Apollo slew the sons with arrows from his silver bow, being angered with Niobe, and shaft-showering Artemis slew the daughters" (Iliad XXIV.14189-14191)
[^il24-matched]: Niobe matched herself against Leto (Iliad XXIV, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

## In the Bibliotheca

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) adds that "Latona for her intrigue with Zeus was hunted by [Hera](hera.md) over the whole earth, till she came to Delos and brought forth first [Artemis](artemis.md), by the help of whose midwifery she afterwards gave birth to [Apollo](apollo.md)."[^apd-leto]

> **VARIANT:** In the [Homeric Hymn to Apollo](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) (III), Hera's interference takes the form of keeping [Eileithyia](eileithyia.md) away from Delos; other goddesses ultimately fetch Eileithyia to assist the birth. In the Bibliotheca, Hera hunts Leto "over the whole earth," and Artemis herself — born first — serves as midwife for Apollo.

[^apd-leto]: "Latona for her intrigue with Zeus was hunted by Hera over the whole earth, till she came to Delos and brought forth first Artemis, by the help of whose midwifery she afterwards gave birth to Apollo." (Bibliotheca 1.4.1, trans. Frazer)

## In the Fabulae

### Python's Pursuit and Neptune's Protection (§140)

The [Fabulae](../sources/hyginus.md) gives a dramatically different version of Leto's wandering, centered on the prophecy and the role of [Python](../creatures/python.md).

"Python, offspring of Terra, was a huge dragon who, before the time of [Apollo](apollo.md), used to give oracular responses on Mount Parnassus."[^hyg-140-python] Crucially, "Death was fated to come to him from the offspring of Latona."[^hyg-140-fate]

"At that time [Jove](zeus.md) lay with Latona, daughter of Polus. When [Juno](hera.md) found this out, she decreed that Latona should give birth at a place where the sun did not shine."[^hyg-140-decree] This is different from Hera keeping Eileithyia away — here Hera directly decrees a condition for the birth.

"When Python knew that Latona was pregnant by Jove, he followed her to kill her."[^hyg-140-pursuit] Python's motive is clear: preventing the birth of the one fated to kill him. This transforms Leto's wandering from a search for a willing birthplace into a flight from death.

"But by order of Jove the wind Aquilo carried Latona away, and bore her to [Neptune](poseidon.md). He protected her, but in order not to make void Juno's decree, he took her to the island Ortygia, and covered the island with waves."[^hyg-140-neptune] Neptune (Poseidon) becomes Leto's divine protector, using the waves to create a place where "the sun did not shine" — technically fulfilling Hera's decree while still allowing the birth.

"When Python did not find her, he returned to Parnassus."[^hyg-140-return] Neptune then "brought the island of Ortygia up to a higher position; it was later called the island of Delos."[^hyg-140-delos]

"There Latona, clinging to an olive tree, bore [Apollo](apollo.md) and [Diana](artemis.md), to whom [Vulcan](hephaestus.md) gave arrows as gifts."[^hyg-140-birth] The detail that Hephaestus gave them arrows immediately after birth is striking and unique to this version.

"Four days after they were born, Apollo exacted vengeance for his mother. For he went to Parnassus and slew Python with his arrows."[^hyg-140-vengeance] The four-day timing is a specific variant — most traditions don't give such a precise interval.

Apollo then "put Python's bones in a cauldron, deposited them in his temple, and instituted funeral games for him which are called Pythian."[^hyg-140-games] This detail — that the Pythian Games were funeral games for Python — is remarkable and appears nowhere else in the tradition.
