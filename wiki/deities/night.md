## Overview

**Night** is a primordial deity born from [Chaos](chaos.md). She is one of the most prolific progenitors in the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md), bearing numerous children both with [Erebus](erebus.md) and alone — most of them personifications of dark or difficult aspects of existence.

## Children

### With Erebus

Aether (Brightness) and Day.[^theog-erebus]

[^theog-erebus]: "but of Night were born Aether and Day, whom she conceived and bare from union in love with Erebus" (Theogony 124-125, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

### Without Union

Night bore the following "though she lay with none":[^theog-children]

- **Doom** (Moros) — "hateful Doom"
- **Fate** (Ker) — "black Fate"
- **Death** (Thanatos)
- **Sleep** (Hypnos) — and "the tribe of Dreams"
- **Blame** (Momus)
- **Woe** (Oizys) — "painful Woe"
- **The Hesperides** — "who guard the rich, golden apples and the trees bearing fruit beyond glorious [Oceanus](oceanus.md)"
- **The Fates** (Moirai) — "the Destinies and ruthless avenging Fates, Clotho and Lachesis and Atropos, who give men at their birth both evil and good to have, and they pursue the transgressions of men and of gods: and these goddesses never cease from their dread anger until they punish the sinner with a sore penalty"[^theog-fates]
- **Nemesis** (Indignation) — "to afflict mortal men"
- **Deceit**
- **Friendship**
- **Age** — "hateful Age"
- **Strife** (Eris) — "hard-hearted Strife"

[^theog-children]: "And Night bare hateful Doom and black Fate and Death, and she bare Sleep and the tribe of Dreams. And again the goddess murky Night, though she lay with none, bare Blame and painful Woe" (Theogony 211-225)
[^theog-fates]: "the Destinies and ruthless avenging Fates, Clotho and Lachesis and Atropos, who give men at their birth both evil and good to have, and they pursue the transgressions of men and of gods: and these goddesses never cease from their dread anger until they punish the sinner with a sore penalty" (Theogony 217-222)

### Grandchildren (through Strife)

Strife in turn bore: "painful Toil and Forgetfulness and Famine and tearful Sorrows, Fightings also, Battles, Murders, Manslaughters, Quarrels, Lying Words, Disputes, Lawlessness and Ruin, all of one nature, and Oath who most troubles men upon earth when anyone wilfully swears a false oath."[^theog-strife]

[^theog-strife]: "abhorred Strife bare painful Toil and Forgetfulness and Famine and tearful Sorrows, Fightings also, Battles, Murders, Manslaughters, Quarrels, Lying Words, Disputes, Lawlessness and Ruin, all of one nature, and Oath who most troubles men upon earth when anyone wilfully swears a false oath" (Theogony 226-232)

## Variant Traditions

### The Two Strifes

In the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md), there is one Strife (Eris), born of Night. But in [Works and Days](../sources/works-and-days.md), Hesiod corrects himself: "there was not one kind of Strife alone, but all over the earth there are two." The harmful Strife "fosters evil war and battle, being cruel." But the other, "the elder daughter of dark Night," is beneficial — she "stirs up even the shiftless to toil" through competition: "potter is angry with potter, and craftsman with craftsman, and beggar is jealous of beggar, and minstrel of minstrel."[^wd-strife]

[^wd-strife]: "there was not one kind of Strife alone, but all over the earth there are two. As for the one, a man would praise her when he came to understand her; but the other is blameworthy... the elder daughter of dark Night, and the son of Cronos who sits above and dwells in the aether, set her in the roots of the earth: and she is far kinder to men" (Works and Days 11-24, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Appearances

- **[Theogony](../sources/theogony.md)** 123-125, 211-232: Birth, offspring with Erebus, offspring alone, grandchildren through Strife
- **[Works and Days](../sources/works-and-days.md)** 11-24: Two kinds of Strife — one harmful, one beneficial
