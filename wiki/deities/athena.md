## Overview

**Athena** is a daughter of [Zeus](zeus.md), born from his head after he swallowed her mother Metis. She is described with the epithets "bright-eyed," "the awful, the strife-stirring, the host-leader, the unwearying, the queen, who delights in tumults and wars and battles."[^theog-epithets]

[^theog-epithets]: "bright-eyed Tritogeneia, the awful, the strife-stirring, the host-leader, the unwearying, the queen, who delights in tumults and wars and battles" (Theogony 924-926, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Birth

[Zeus](zeus.md) swallowed Metis ("wisest among gods and mortal men") when she was pregnant with Athena, on the advice of [Gaia](gaia.md) and [Uranus](uranus.md), because "very wise children were destined to be born of her, first the maiden bright-eyed Tritogeneia, equal to her father in strength and in wise understanding; but afterwards she was to bear a son of overbearing spirit, king of gods and men."[^theog-prophecy]

"The father of men and gods gave her birth by way of his head on the banks of the river Trito."[^theog-birth] She was born "arrayed in arms of war."[^theog-arms]

Metis "remained hidden beneath the inward parts of Zeus... worker of righteousness, who was wiser than gods and mortal men. There the goddess (Athena) received that whereby she excelled in strength all the deathless ones who dwell in [Olympus](../places/olympus.md)."[^theog-metis]

[^theog-prophecy]: "very wise children were destined to be born of her, first the maiden bright-eyed Tritogeneia, equal to her father in strength and in wise understanding; but afterwards she was to bear a son of overbearing spirit, king of gods and men" (Theogony 886-898)
[^theog-birth]: "the father of men and gods gave her birth by way of his head on the banks of the river Trito" (Theogony 929h-929i)
[^theog-arms]: "with it (Zeus) gave her birth, arrayed in arms of war" (Theogony 929t)
[^theog-metis]: "she remained hidden beneath the inward parts of Zeus, even Metis, Athena's mother, worker of righteousness, who was wiser than gods and mortal men. There the goddess (Athena) received that whereby she excelled in strength all the deathless ones who dwell in Olympus" (Theogony 929n-929r)

## Roles

In the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md), Athena is mentioned as:
- Clothing the first woman with "silvery raiment" and a "broidered veil" and garlands, as part of [Zeus](zeus.md)'s punishment for [Prometheus](prometheus.md)'s theft of fire.[^theog-woman]
- Named as "the spoil-driver" who planned the destruction of the Hydra by [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) and Iolaus.[^theog-hydra]

[^theog-woman]: "the goddess bright-eyed Athene girded and clothed her with silvery raiment, and down from her head she spread with her hands a broidered veil, a wonder to see; and she, Pallas Athene, put about her head lovely garlands, flowers of new-grown herbs" (Theogony 573-578)
[^theog-hydra]: "Heracles, the son of Zeus, of the house of Amphitryon, together with warlike Iolaus, destroyed with the unpitying sword through the plans of Athene the spoil-driver" (Theogony 318)

## Birth — Cosmic Impact (Hymn XXVIII)

[Homeric Hymn XXVIII](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) describes the cosmic reaction to Athena's birth: "From his awful head wise [Zeus](zeus.md) himself bare her arrayed in warlike arms of flashing gold, and awe seized all the gods as they gazed. But Athena sprang quickly from the immortal head and stood before [Zeus](zeus.md)... shaking a sharp spear: great [Olympus](../places/olympus.md) began to reel horribly at the might of the bright-eyed goddess, and earth round about cried fearfully, and the sea was moved and tossed with dark waves." Even [Helius](helius.md) "stopped his swift-footed horses a long while, until the maiden Pallas Athene had stripped the heavenly armour from her immortal shoulders."[^hh28-birth]

[^hh28-birth]: "From his awful head wise Zeus himself bare her arrayed in warlike arms of flashing gold, and awe seized all the gods as they gazed. But Athena sprang quickly from the immortal head and stood before Zeus who holds the aegis, shaking a sharp spear: great Olympus began to reel horribly at the might of the bright-eyed goddess, and earth round about cried fearfully, and the sea was moved and tossed with dark waves, while foam burst forth suddenly: the bright Son of Hyperion stopped his swift-footed horses a long while, until the maiden Pallas Athene had stripped the heavenly armour from her immortal shoulders. And wise Zeus was glad." (Homeric Hymn XXVIII to Athena 4-16, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## In the Iliad

### Restraining Achilles (Book I)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book I, when Achilles is about to draw his sword against Agamemnon, "Athene came to him from heaven, sent forth of the white-armed goddess [Hera](hera.md), whose heart loved both alike and had care for them. She stood behind Peleus' son and caught him by his golden hair, to him only visible, and of the rest no man beheld her." Achilles "straightway knew Pallas Athene; and terribly shone her eyes."[^il1-restrain]

She promised him: "hereafter shall goodly gifts come to thee, yea in threefold measure, by reason of this despite; hold thou thine hand, and hearken to us."[^il1-promise]

### Stopping the Retreat and the Aegis (Book II)

When the Greeks rush to flee after Agamemnon's test, [Hera](hera.md) sends Athena to stop them. She goes to Odysseus, speaking to him directly (he "knew the voice of the goddess"), and through him rallies the army.[^il2-retreat]

She then marches with the army bearing her aegis: "bright-eyed Athene in the midst, bearing the holy aegis that knoweth neither age nor death, whereon wave an hundred tassels of pure gold, all deftly woven and each one an hundred oxen worth. Therewith she passed dazzling through the Achaian folk, urging them forth; and in every man's heart she roused strength to battle."[^il2-aegis]

### Fostering Erechtheus (Book II)

In the Catalogue of Ships, Athens is described as "the domain of Erechtheus the high-hearted, whom erst Athene daughter of Zeus fostered when Earth, the grain-giver, brought him to birth; and she gave him a resting-place in Athens in her own rich sanctuary."[^il2-erechtheus]

[^il1-restrain]: "Athene came to him from heaven, sent forth of the white-armed goddess Hera, whose heart loved both alike and had care for them. She stood behind Peleus' son and caught him by his golden hair, to him only visible, and of the rest no man beheld her. Then Achilles marvelled, and turned him about, and straightway knew Pallas Athene; and terribly shone her eyes" (Iliad I.195-200, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il1-promise]: "hereafter shall goodly gifts come to thee, yea in threefold measure, by reason of this despite; hold thou thine hand, and hearken to us" (Iliad I.213-214)
[^il2-retreat]: "bright-eyed Athene stood by him and said: 'Heaven-sprung son of Laertes, Odysseus of many devices, will ye indeed fling yourselves upon your benched ships to flee homeward to your dear native land?'" (Iliad II.946-948, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il2-aegis]: "bright-eyed Athene in the midst, bearing the holy aegis that knoweth neither age nor death, whereon wave an hundred tassels of pure gold, all deftly woven and each one an hundred oxen worth. Therewith she passed dazzling through the Achaian folk, urging them forth; and in every man's heart she roused strength to battle without ceasing and to fight" (Iliad II.1197-1202)
[^il2-erechtheus]: "the goodly citadel of Athens, the domain of Erechtheus the high-hearted, whom erst Athene daughter of Zeus fostered when Earth, the grain-giver, brought him to birth; and she gave him a resting-place in Athens in her own rich sanctuary; and there the sons of the Athenians worship him with bulls and rams as the years turn in their courses" (Iliad II.1282-1287)

### Denying Troy's Prayer (Book VI)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book VI, the Trojans pray to Athena in desperation. Hector instructs his mother Hekabe to gather the aged wives and offer "the robe that seemeth to her the most gracious and greatest in her hall" upon the knees of "beauteous-haired Athene" along with a vow of twelve unbroken kine, "if she will have mercy on the city and the Trojans' wives and little children."[^il6-prayer-request]

The priestess Theano places the fairest robe on Athena's knees and prays: "Lady Athene, saviour of the city, fair among goddesses, break now Diomedes' spear, and grant moreover that himself may fall prone before the Skaian gates." But: "So spake she praying, but Pallas Athene denied the prayer."[^il6-denied]

[^il6-prayer-request]: "let her lay the robe, that seemeth to her the most gracious and greatest in her hall and far dearest unto herself, upon the knees of beauteous-haired Athene; and vow to her to sacrifice in her temple twelve sleek kine, that have not felt the goad, if she will have mercy on the city and the Trojans' wives and little children" (Iliad VI.3544-3549, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il6-denied]: "Lady Athene, saviour of the city, fair among goddesses, break now Diomedes' spear, and grant moreover that himself may fall prone before the Skaian gates; that we may sacrifice thee now forthwith in thy temple twelve sleek kine, that have not felt the goad, if thou wilt have mercy on the city and the Trojans' wives and little children. So spake she praying, but Pallas Athene denied the prayer." (Iliad VI.3749-3754)
