## Overview

**Athena** is a daughter of [Zeus](zeus.md), born from his head after he swallowed her mother Metis. She is described with the epithets "bright-eyed," "the awful, the strife-stirring, the host-leader, the unwearying, the queen, who delights in tumults and wars and battles."[^theog-epithets]

[^theog-epithets]: "bright-eyed Tritogeneia, the awful, the strife-stirring, the host-leader, the unwearying, the queen, who delights in tumults and wars and battles" (Theogony 924-926, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Birth

[Zeus](zeus.md) swallowed Metis ("wisest among gods and mortal men") when she was pregnant with Athena, on the advice of [Gaia](gaia.md) and [Uranus](uranus.md), because "very wise children were destined to be born of her, first the maiden bright-eyed Tritogeneia, equal to her father in strength and in wise understanding; but afterwards she was to bear a son of overbearing spirit, king of gods and men."[^theog-prophecy]

"The father of men and gods gave her birth by way of his head on the banks of the river Trito."[^theog-birth] She was born "arrayed in arms of war."[^theog-arms]

Metis "remained hidden beneath the inward parts of Zeus... worker of righteousness, who was wiser than gods and mortal men. There the goddess (Athena) received that whereby she excelled in strength all the deathless ones who dwell in [Olympus](../places/olympus.md)."[^theog-metis]

[^theog-prophecy]: "very wise children were destined to be born of her, first the maiden bright-eyed Tritogeneia, equal to her father in strength and in wise understanding; but afterwards she was to bear a son of overbearing spirit, king of gods and men" (Theogony 886-898)
[^theog-birth]: "the father of men and gods gave her birth by way of his head on the banks of the river Trito" (Theogony 929h-929i)
[^theog-arms]: "with it (Zeus) gave her birth, arrayed in arms of war" (Theogony 929t)
[^theog-metis]: "she remained hidden beneath the inward parts of Zeus, even Metis, Athena's mother, worker of righteousness, who was wiser than gods and mortal men. There the goddess (Athena) received that whereby she excelled in strength all the deathless ones who dwell in Olympus" (Theogony 929n-929r)

## Roles

In the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md), Athena is mentioned as:
- Clothing the first woman with "silvery raiment" and a "broidered veil" and garlands, as part of [Zeus](zeus.md)'s punishment for [Prometheus](prometheus.md)'s theft of fire.[^theog-woman]
- Named as "the spoil-driver" who planned the destruction of the Hydra by [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) and Iolaus.[^theog-hydra]

[^theog-woman]: "the goddess bright-eyed Athene girded and clothed her with silvery raiment, and down from her head she spread with her hands a broidered veil, a wonder to see; and she, Pallas Athene, put about her head lovely garlands, flowers of new-grown herbs" (Theogony 573-578)
[^theog-hydra]: "Heracles, the son of Zeus, of the house of Amphitryon, together with warlike Iolaus, destroyed with the unpitying sword through the plans of Athene the spoil-driver" (Theogony 318)

## Birth — Cosmic Impact (Hymn XXVIII)

[Homeric Hymn XXVIII](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) describes the cosmic reaction to Athena's birth: "From his awful head wise [Zeus](zeus.md) himself bare her arrayed in warlike arms of flashing gold, and awe seized all the gods as they gazed. But Athena sprang quickly from the immortal head and stood before [Zeus](zeus.md)... shaking a sharp spear: great [Olympus](../places/olympus.md) began to reel horribly at the might of the bright-eyed goddess, and earth round about cried fearfully, and the sea was moved and tossed with dark waves." Even [Helius](helius.md) "stopped his swift-footed horses a long while, until the maiden Pallas Athene had stripped the heavenly armour from her immortal shoulders."[^hh28-birth]

[^hh28-birth]: "From his awful head wise Zeus himself bare her arrayed in warlike arms of flashing gold, and awe seized all the gods as they gazed. But Athena sprang quickly from the immortal head and stood before Zeus who holds the aegis, shaking a sharp spear: great Olympus began to reel horribly at the might of the bright-eyed goddess, and earth round about cried fearfully, and the sea was moved and tossed with dark waves, while foam burst forth suddenly: the bright Son of Hyperion stopped his swift-footed horses a long while, until the maiden Pallas Athene had stripped the heavenly armour from her immortal shoulders. And wise Zeus was glad." (Homeric Hymn XXVIII to Athena 4-16, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
