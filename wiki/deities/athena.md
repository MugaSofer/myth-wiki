## Overview

**Athena** is a daughter of [Zeus](zeus.md), born from his head after he swallowed her mother Metis. She is described with the epithets "bright-eyed," "the awful, the strife-stirring, the host-leader, the unwearying, the queen, who delights in tumults and wars and battles."[^theog-epithets]

[^theog-epithets]: "bright-eyed Tritogeneia, the awful, the strife-stirring, the host-leader, the unwearying, the queen, who delights in tumults and wars and battles" (Theogony 924-926, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Epithets

- **"bright-eyed"** / **"grey-eyed"** — the most frequent epithet, used throughout all sources (Theogony 13, 573, 888, 924; Iliad passim)
- **"Tritogeneia"** / **"Trito-born"** — from her birthplace by the river Trito (Theogony 895, 924; Iliad XXII)[^desc-trito]
- **"Pallas Athene"** — the standard compound name (Iliad passim)
- **"the Giver of Spoil"** / **"the spoil-driver"** — (Theogony 318; Iliad X)
- **"beauteous-haired Athene"** / **"saviour of the city"** — used by the Trojans in prayer (Iliad VI)
- **"the bright-eyed Maiden"** — (Iliad XXIV)

[^desc-trito]: "Be of good cheer, Trito-born, dear child" (Iliad XXII.12455-12456, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

## Appearance

When she restrains Achilles, "terribly shone her eyes" — visible only to him while invisible to others.[^desc-eyes] At her birth, she sprang from Zeus's head "arrayed in warlike arms of flashing gold," shaking a sharp spear so that "great [Olympus](../places/olympus.md) began to reel horribly."[^desc-birth-arms]

In the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md), she wears "lovely golden sandals that wax not old" that carry her "over the wet sea and over the limitless land, swift as the breath of the wind," and carries "her doughty spear, shod with sharp bronze, weighty and huge and strong."[^od1-equip] She departs Ithaca "like an eagle of the sea."[^od1-eagle]

Her full arming is described twice in the Iliad (Books V and VIII): she puts on "the tunic of [Zeus](zeus.md) the cloud-gatherer," then "the great shield of the [aegis](../objects/aegis.md)... therein is Panic, therein Strife, therein Valour, therein the dread onset of Battle, therein the [Gorgon](../creatures/gorgons.md) head of the dread monster." On her head she sets "the two-crested golden helm with four plates, adorned with men-at-arms of an hundred cities." She wields "her father's spear, the great, the stout, the heavy, wherewith she vanquisheth the ranks of men."[^desc-arming]

She also wears the **[helm of Hades](../objects/helm-of-hades.md)**, which grants invisibility — "that terrible [Ares](ares.md) might not behold her."[^desc-hades-helm]

### The Aegis

The [aegis](../objects/aegis.md) is described separately from her arming scenes: "the holy aegis that knoweth neither age nor death, whereon wave an hundred tassels of pure gold, all deftly woven and each one an hundred oxen worth. Therewith she passed dazzling through the Achaian folk."[^desc-aegis]

[^desc-eyes]: "straightway knew Pallas Athene; and terribly shone her eyes" (Iliad I.200, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^desc-birth-arms]: "From his awful head wise Zeus himself bare her arrayed in warlike arms of flashing gold, and awe seized all the gods as they gazed" (Homeric Hymn XXVIII to Athena 4-6, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^desc-arming]: "she put on the tunic of Zeus the cloud-gatherer, and arrayed her in her armour for dolorous battle. About her shoulders cast she the tasselled aegis terrible, all about which Terror is as a crown, and therein is Strife, therein Valour, therein the dread onset of Battle, therein the Gorgon head of the dread monster, terrible and grim, portent of aegis-bearing Zeus. Upon her head she set the two-crested golden helm with four plates, adorned with men-at-arms of an hundred cities. Upon the flaming chariot set she her foot, and grasped her heavy spear, great and stout, wherewith she vanquisheth the ranks of men" (Iliad V.3185-3198)
[^desc-hades-helm]: "she put on the helm of Hades, that terrible Ares might not behold her" (Iliad V.3205-3206)
[^desc-aegis]: "bright-eyed Athene in the midst, bearing the holy aegis that knoweth neither age nor death, whereon wave an hundred tassels of pure gold, all deftly woven and each one an hundred oxen worth. Therewith she passed dazzling through the Achaian folk" (Iliad II.1197-1201)

## Powers

- **Empowering mortals:** She sets fire blazing from Diomedes' head and shoulders, and grants him sight to distinguish gods from men.[^desc-fire] She later does the same for Achilles — casting her aegis around him, setting "a golden cloud" and "blazing fire" on his head, and adding her voice to his shout so that "Pallas Athene uttered her voice, and spread terror unspeakable."[^desc-achilles-fire]
- **Protecting mortals:** She wards off weapons — from Menelaos "even as a mother driveth a fly from her child," and from Odysseus so that a spear "did not suffer it to mingle with the bowels."[^desc-protect]
- **Disguise and deception:** She appears as Laodokos (IV), Deiphobus (XXII), and in vulture form (VII). She tricks Hector into facing Achilles by impersonating his brother, then invisibly retrieves Achilles' thrown spear.[^desc-deception]
- **Physical combat:** She hurls a boundary stone at Ares so that "seven roods he covered in his fall," and strikes [Aphrodite](aphrodite.md) on the breast with her fist.[^desc-combat]
- **Motherly patronage of Odysseus:** Aias calls her "the goddess... from of old like a mother standeth by Odysseus' side."[^desc-odysseus]

[^desc-fire]: "she kindled from his helm and shield flame unwearying, like to the star of summer that above all stars riseth brightest bathed in the Ocean stream. In such wise kindled she fire from his head and shoulders" (Iliad V.2611-2614, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^desc-achilles-fire]: "the bright-eyed goddess Athene cast about his mighty shoulders the tasselled aegis, and around his head the divine goddess set a crown of golden cloud, and kindled therefrom a blazing fire... Pallas Athene uttered her voice, and spread terror unspeakable among the men of Troy" (Iliad XVIII.10553-10562)
[^desc-protect]: "even as a mother driveth a fly from her child that lieth in sweet slumber" (Iliad IV.2176-2177)
[^desc-deception]: "she left him and came to noble Hector, like unto Deiphobos in shape and in strong voice... Thus saying Athene in her subtlety led him on" (Iliad XXII.12493-12514)
[^desc-combat]: "she sprang forth and caught up a stone that lay in the plain, black, rugged, huge, that men of old time set to be the boundary of a field: therewith smote she fierce Ares on the neck, and unstrung his limbs" (Iliad XXI.12103-12106)
[^desc-odysseus]: "the goddess who from of old like a mother standeth by Odysseus' side and helpeth him" (Iliad XXIII.13463-13464)

## Birth

[Zeus](zeus.md) swallowed Metis ("wisest among gods and mortal men") when she was pregnant with Athena, on the advice of [Gaia](gaia.md) and [Uranus](uranus.md), because "very wise children were destined to be born of her, first the maiden bright-eyed Tritogeneia, equal to her father in strength and in wise understanding; but afterwards she was to bear a son of overbearing spirit, king of gods and men."[^theog-prophecy]

"The father of men and gods gave her birth by way of his head on the banks of the river Trito."[^theog-birth] She was born "arrayed in arms of war."[^theog-arms]

Metis "remained hidden beneath the inward parts of Zeus... worker of righteousness, who was wiser than gods and mortal men. There the goddess (Athena) received that whereby she excelled in strength all the deathless ones who dwell in [Olympus](../places/olympus.md)."[^theog-metis]

[^theog-prophecy]: "very wise children were destined to be born of her, first the maiden bright-eyed Tritogeneia, equal to her father in strength and in wise understanding; but afterwards she was to bear a son of overbearing spirit, king of gods and men" (Theogony 886-898)
[^theog-birth]: "the father of men and gods gave her birth by way of his head on the banks of the river Trito" (Theogony 929h-929i)
[^theog-arms]: "with it (Zeus) gave her birth, arrayed in arms of war" (Theogony 929t)
[^theog-metis]: "she remained hidden beneath the inward parts of Zeus, even Metis, Athena's mother, worker of righteousness, who was wiser than gods and mortal men. There the goddess (Athena) received that whereby she excelled in strength all the deathless ones who dwell in Olympus" (Theogony 929n-929r)

## Roles

In the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md), Athena is mentioned as:
- Clothing the first woman with "silvery raiment" and a "broidered veil" and garlands, as part of [Zeus](zeus.md)'s punishment for [Prometheus](prometheus.md)'s theft of fire.[^theog-woman]
- Named as "the spoil-driver" who planned the destruction of the Hydra by [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) and Iolaus.[^theog-hydra]

[^theog-woman]: "the goddess bright-eyed Athene girded and clothed her with silvery raiment, and down from her head she spread with her hands a broidered veil, a wonder to see; and she, Pallas Athene, put about her head lovely garlands, flowers of new-grown herbs" (Theogony 573-578)
[^theog-hydra]: "Heracles, the son of Zeus, of the house of Amphitryon, together with warlike Iolaus, destroyed with the unpitying sword through the plans of Athene the spoil-driver" (Theogony 318)

## Birth — Apollodorus's Account (Bibliotheca)

Apollodorus adds significant details to the birth narrative. [Zeus](zeus.md) swallowed Metis after she "turned into many shapes in order to avoid his embraces" and when she "was with child," because "[Gaia](gaia.md) said that, after giving birth to the maiden who was then in her womb, Metis would bear a son who should be the lord of heaven."[^apd-athena-metis]

The birth itself is more specific than in the Theogony: "[Prometheus](prometheus.md) or, as others say, [Hephaestus](hephaestus.md), smote the head of Zeus with an axe, and Athena, fully armed, leaped up from the top of his head at the river Triton."[^apd-athena-birth] The Theogony says only that Zeus "gave her birth by way of his head on the banks of the river Trito." Apollodorus names the agent (Prometheus or Hephaestus), the instrument (an axe), and gives the dual tradition.

[^apd-athena-metis]: "Zeus had intercourse with Metis, who turned into many shapes in order to avoid his embraces. When she was with child, Zeus, taking time by the forelock, swallowed her, because Earth said that, after giving birth to the maiden who was then in her womb, Metis would bear a son who should be the lord of heaven" (Bibliotheca 1.3.6, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-athena-birth]: "Prometheus or, as others say, Hephaestus, smote the head of Zeus with an axe, and Athena, fully armed, leaped up from the top of his head at the river Triton" (Bibliotheca 1.3.6, trans. Frazer)

## Birth — Cosmic Impact (Hymn XXVIII)

[Homeric Hymn XXVIII](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) describes the cosmic reaction to Athena's birth: "From his awful head wise [Zeus](zeus.md) himself bare her arrayed in warlike arms of flashing gold, and awe seized all the gods as they gazed. But Athena sprang quickly from the immortal head and stood before [Zeus](zeus.md)... shaking a sharp spear: great [Olympus](../places/olympus.md) began to reel horribly at the might of the bright-eyed goddess, and earth round about cried fearfully, and the sea was moved and tossed with dark waves." Even [Helius](helius.md) "stopped his swift-footed horses a long while, until the maiden Pallas Athene had stripped the heavenly armour from her immortal shoulders."[^hh28-birth]

[^hh28-birth]: "From his awful head wise Zeus himself bare her arrayed in warlike arms of flashing gold, and awe seized all the gods as they gazed. But Athena sprang quickly from the immortal head and stood before Zeus who holds the aegis, shaking a sharp spear: great Olympus began to reel horribly at the might of the bright-eyed goddess, and earth round about cried fearfully, and the sea was moved and tossed with dark waves, while foam burst forth suddenly: the bright Son of Hyperion stopped his swift-footed horses a long while, until the maiden Pallas Athene had stripped the heavenly armour from her immortal shoulders. And wise Zeus was glad." (Homeric Hymn XXVIII to Athena 4-16, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## In the Odyssey

### Advocate for Odysseus (Book I)

In the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md), Athena is Odysseus's primary divine patron. When [Poseidon](poseidon.md) is away among the Ethiopians, she seizes the moment to plead Odysseus's case before [Zeus](zeus.md) and the assembled gods: "my heart is rent for wise Odysseus, that hapless one, who far from his friends this long while suffereth affliction in a seagirt isle." She describes his captor Calypso as "the daughter of the wizard [Atlas](atlas.md), who knows the depths of every sea, and himself upholds the tall pillars which keep earth and sky asunder," and accuses Zeus of ingratitude: "What! did not Odysseus by the ships of the Argives make thee free offering of sacrifice in the wide Trojan land? Wherefore wast thou then so wroth with him, O Zeus?"[^od1-advocate]

When Zeus agrees to act, Athena proposes the plan: send [Hermes](hermes.md) to Calypso to release Odysseus, while she herself goes to Ithaca to rouse his son Telemachus.[^od1-plan]

### Disguised as Mentes (Book I)

Athena goes to Ithaca in mortal guise: "She bound beneath her feet her lovely golden sandals that wax not old, and bare her alike over the wet sea and over the limitless land, swift as the breath of the wind. And she seized her doughty spear, shod with sharp bronze, weighty and huge and strong, wherewith she quells the ranks of heroes with whomsoever she is wroth, the daughter of the mighty sire."[^od1-equip]

She stands at Odysseus's gate "in the semblance of a stranger, Mentes the captain of the Taphians," and is welcomed by Telemachus.[^od1-mentes] She counsels him to call an assembly, dismiss the wooers, and sail to Pylos and Sparta seeking news of his father. She invokes the example of Orestes: "Or hast thou not heard what renown the goodly Orestes gat him among all men in that he slew the slayer of his father?"[^od1-orestes]

When she departs, "like an eagle of the sea she flew away, but in his spirit she planted might and courage, and put him in mind of his father yet more than heretofore. And he marked the thing and was amazed, for he deemed that it was a god."[^od1-eagle]

Later, when Penelope weeps at the minstrel Phemius's song, "grey-eyed Athene cast sweet sleep upon her eyelids."[^od1-sleep]

### Saving Odysseus at Sea (Book V)

After [Poseidon](poseidon.md) wrecks Odysseus's raft and departs, "Athene, daughter of [Zeus](zeus.md), turned to new thoughts. Behold, she bound up the courses of the other winds, and charged them all to cease and be still; but she roused the swift North and brake the waves before him, that so Odysseus, of the seed of Zeus, might mingle with the Phaeacians, lovers of the oar, avoiding death and the fates."[^od5-winds]

When the waves dash Odysseus against the rocks, "the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, put a thought into his heart" to clutch the rock; then after the wave swept him back, "grey-eyed Athene given him sure counsel" to swim along the coast seeking a river mouth.[^od5-counsel] Once he reaches shore, "Athene shed sleep upon his eyes, that so it might soon release him from his weary travail, overshadowing his eyelids."[^od5-sleep]

[^od5-winds]: "Athene, daughter of Zeus, turned to new thoughts. Behold, she bound up the courses of the other winds, and charged them all to cease and be still; but she roused the swift North and brake the waves before him, that so Odysseus, of the seed of Zeus, might mingle with the Phaeacians, lovers of the oar, avoiding death and the fates" (Odyssey V.3361-3365, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od5-counsel]: "the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, put a thought into his heart. He rushed in, and with both his hands clutched the rock... grey-eyed Athene given him sure counsel. He rose from the line of the breakers that belch upon the shore, and swam outside, ever looking landwards, to find, if he might, spits that take the waves aslant" (Odyssey V.3402-3414)
[^od5-sleep]: "Athene shed sleep upon his eyes, that so it might soon release him from his weary travail, overshadowing his eyelids" (Odyssey V.3464-3466)

### Dream to Nausicaa; Beautifying Odysseus (Book VI)

In [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) Book VI, Athena goes to Phaeacia "devising a return for the great-hearted Odysseus." She enters Nausicaa's bower "fleet as the breath of the wind" and speaks to her "in the semblance of the daughter of a famous seafarer, Dymas," prompting her to go wash clothes at the river.[^od6-dream]

When Odysseus wakes and the maidens flee, "the daughter of Alcinous alone stood firm, for Athene gave her courage of heart, and took all trembling from her limbs."[^od6-courage] After Odysseus bathes, "Athene, the daughter of Zeus, made him greater and more mighty to behold, and from his head caused deep curling locks to flow, like the hyacinth flower. And as when some skilful man overlays gold upon silver—one that [Hephaestus](hephaestus.md) and Pallas Athene have taught all manner of craft, and full of grace is his handiwork—even so did Athene shed grace about his head and shoulders."[^od6-beautify]

She does not yet appear to Odysseus directly: "she did not yet appear to him face to face, for she had regard unto her father's brother [[Poseidon](poseidon.md)], who furiously raged against the godlike Odysseus, till he should come to his own country."[^od6-hidden]

[^od6-dream]: "the goddess, fleet as the breath of the wind, swept towards the couch of the maiden, and stood above her head, and spake to her in the semblance of the daughter of a famous seafarer, Dymas, a girl of like age with Nausicaa" (Odyssey VI.3497-3500, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od6-courage]: "the daughter of Alcinous alone stood firm, for Athene gave her courage of heart, and took all trembling from her limbs" (Odyssey VI.3616-3617)
[^od6-beautify]: "Athene, the daughter of Zeus, made him greater and more mighty to behold, and from his head caused deep curling locks to flow, like the hyacinth flower. And as when some skilful man overlays gold upon silver—one that Hephaestus and Pallas Athene have taught all manner of craft, and full of grace is his handiwork—even so did Athene shed grace about his head and shoulders" (Odyssey VI.3700-3704)
[^od6-hidden]: "she did not yet appear to him face to face, for she had regard unto her father's brother, who furiously raged against the godlike Odysseus, till he should come to his own country" (Odyssey VI.3791-3793)

### Guide Through Phaeacia (Book VII)

Athena "shed a deep mist about Odysseus for the favour that she bare him" and met him "in the fashion of a young maiden carrying a pitcher." She told him of the Phaeacians' swift ships: "the Earth-shaker hath vouchsafed them this power. Their ships are swift as the flight of a bird, or as a thought."[^od7-guide]

She reveals the Phaeacian royal genealogy to Odysseus — [Poseidon](poseidon.md) lay with Periboea, youngest daughter of Eurymedon who was king of the [Giants](../creatures/giants.md); their son Nausithous founded Scheria.[^od7-genealogy] Then "grey-eyed Athene departed over the unharvested seas, and left pleasant Scheria, and came to Marathon and wide-wayed Athens, and entered the good house of Erechtheus."[^od7-erechtheus]

Inside the palace, she maintained her protection: "the steadfast goodly Odysseus went through the hall, clad in a thick mist, which Athene shed around him."[^od7-mist]

[^od7-guide]: "Athene shed a deep mist about Odysseus for the favour that she bare him... the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, met him, in the fashion of a young maiden carrying a pitcher... Their ships are swift as the flight of a bird, or as a thought" (Odyssey VII.3820-3840, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od7-genealogy]: "First Nausithous was son of Poseidon, the Earth-shaker, and of Periboea, the comeliest of women, youngest daughter of great-hearted Eurymedon, who once was king among the haughty Giants" (Odyssey VII.3859-3862)
[^od7-mist]: "the steadfast goodly Odysseus went through the hall, clad in a thick mist, which Athene shed around him" (Odyssey VII.3935-3936)
[^od7-erechtheus]: "grey-eyed Athene departed over the unharvested seas, and left pleasant Scheria, and came to Marathon and wide-wayed Athens, and entered the good house of Erechtheus" (Odyssey VII.3882-3884)

### Return to Ithaca (Books XIII-XVI)

The reunion of [Athena](athena.md) and Odysseus on Ithaca in Book XIII is one of the great recognition scenes in the poem — two masters of craft delighting in each other's cunning.

**The mist and the disguise (XIII).** When the Phaeacians set sleeping Odysseus ashore, Athena shrouds his homeland from him: she "shed a mist about all things, that she might make him unknown, and might expound to him all matters."[^od13-mist] She first approaches him "in the guise of a young man, the herdsman of a flock, a young man most delicate, such as are the sons of kings."[^od13-herdsman] Odysseus, true to form, responds with an elaborate false tale — and the goddess is charmed rather than offended.

**The revelation.** She changes form, appearing "to the semblance of a woman, fair and tall, and skilled in splendid handiwork."[^od13-reveal] Then comes a remarkable speech of mutual recognition: she tells him that "both of us practised in deceits, for that thou art of all men far the first in counsel and in discourse, and I in the company of all the gods win renown for my wit and wile."[^od13-craft] This is the theological heart of the Athena-Odysseus relationship — patron and hero bound not by obligation or cult, but by kinship of mind.

She explains her long apparent absence. She was "always by thee and guard thee in all adventures" but would not openly oppose [Poseidon](poseidon.md): "I had no mind to be at strife with Poseidon, my own father's brother."[^od13-poseidon] This reveals the delicate politics of Olympian patronage — even Athena must navigate family loyalties among the gods.

**Transformation to beggar (XIII).** To prepare Odysseus for his return, Athena transforms him with her wand: she withers his skin, wastes the hair from his head, dims his eyes, and wraps him in foul garments — making the king unrecognisable in his own land.[^od13-transform]

**Rousing Telemachus (XV).** Athena goes to Sparta to rouse Telemachus for his return to Ithaca, appearing to him at night.[^od15-telemachus] She also sends a favourable breeze for his voyage home.[^od15-breeze]

**Selective divine visibility (XVI).** When father and son must be reunited, Athena appears to Odysseus outside the swineherd's hut — but Telemachus cannot see her, "for the gods in no wise appear visibly to all."[^od16-invisible] This statement, offered almost casually, is one of the poem's most significant theological observations: divine presence is not universal but particular, granted according to the god's will.

She then transforms Odysseus back with her golden wand, restoring him so that "dark his colour grew again, and his cheeks filled out, and the black beard spread thick around his chin."[^od16-restore] After the recognition between father and son, she transforms him back to the old beggar once more.[^od16-re-disguise]

The transformation power displayed across these books — beggar to king to beggar, at a touch of her wand — demonstrates a kind of divine authority over mortal identity itself. Athena does not merely disguise Odysseus; she remakes him.

### The Slaying of the Wooers (Books XVII-XXII)

**Beautifying Penelope (XVIII).** In a scene that parallels her beautification of Odysseus, Athena transforms Penelope as she sleeps: "Her fair face first she steeped with beauty imperishable, such as that wherewith the crowned Cytherea is anointed, when she goes to the lovely dances of the [Graces](graces.md). And she made her taller and greater to behold, and made her whiter than new-sawn ivory."[^od18-penelope] The comparison to [Aphrodite](aphrodite.md) is striking — Athena applies the same cosmetic arts as the goddess of beauty herself.

**As Mentor at the slaying (XXII).** When the battle with the wooers begins in earnest, [Athena](athena.md) appears "like Mentor in fashion and in voice," and Odysseus is glad.[^od22-mentor] But when the wooers threaten Mentor, Athena chides Odysseus: "thou hast no more steadfast might nor any prowess, as when for nine whole years continually thou didst battle with the Trojans."[^od22-chide] She does not yet grant full victory, but instead "she flew up to the roof timber of the murky hall, in such fashion as a swallow flies, and there sat down."[^od22-swallow]

When the wooers cast their spears, "Athene so wrought that they were all in vain."[^od22-vain] Then comes the decisive intervention: "Athene held up her destroying [aegis](../objects/aegis.md) on high from the roof, and their minds were scared, and they fled through the hall, like a drove of kine that the flitting gadfly falls upon and scatters hither and thither in spring time."[^od22-aegis] The aegis — the same weapon she bears in the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) arming scenes — here ends the contest in a moment of divine terror.

### Beautifying Odysseus Again; Holding Back Dawn (Book XXIII)

After the slaying, Athena beautifies Odysseus for his reunion with Penelope, repeating the same transformation she performed in Book VI: "Athene shed great beauty from his head downwards, and made him greater and more mighty to behold, and from his head caused deep curling locks to flow, like the hyacinth flower. And as when some skilful man overlays gold upon silver, one that [Hephaestus](hephaestus.md) and Pallas Athene have taught all manner of craft, and full of grace is his handiwork, even so did Athene shed grace about his head and shoulders."[^od23-beautify] The verbatim repetition of the gold-on-silver simile from Book VI frames the entire poem — the same divine craft that made Odysseus presentable to a princess now makes him presentable to his wife.

Then Athena performs her most remarkable feat of cosmic power: "the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, had other thoughts. The night she held long in the utmost West, and on the other side she stayed the golden-throned Dawn by the stream [Oceanus](oceanus.md), and suffered her not to harness the swift-footed steeds that bear light to men, Lampus and Phaethon, the steeds ever young, that bring the morning."[^od23-dawn] This is an extraordinary extension of Athena's power — not merely shaping mortal appearances but commanding cosmic time itself, holding back Dawn so that husband and wife may have their night together.

As Odysseus departs, "Athene hid in night, and quickly conducted out of the town."[^od23-night]

### The Final Peace (Book XXIV)

Athena's power of transformation extends even to the aged Laertes, Odysseus's father: "Athene drew nigh, and made greater the limbs of the shepherd of the people, taller she made him than before and mightier to behold."[^od24-laertes] His own son marvels at him, "beholding him like to the deathless gods in presence." This is the same transformative power used on Odysseus throughout the poem, now applied to a third generation.

When battle comes against the kinsmen of the slain wooers, "Pallas Athene breathed into him great strength"[^od24-strength] — and Laertes, strengthened by the goddess, slays Eupeithes with a single cast.

But Athena's role in the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) ends not with violence but with peace. She calls halt to the fighting: "Hold your hands from fierce fighting, ye men of Ithaca, that so ye may be parted quickly, without bloodshed."[^od24-halt] [Zeus](zeus.md) confirms her authority with a cosmic sign: "the son of Cronos cast forth a flaming bolt, and it fell at the feet of the grey-eyed goddess, the daughter of the mighty Sire."[^od24-bolt] Then, "Pallas Athene set a covenant between them with sacrifice, she, the daughter of [Zeus](zeus.md) lord of the [aegis](../objects/aegis.md), in the likeness of Mentor, both in fashion and in voice."[^od24-covenant]

The poem ends as it began — with Athena acting, disguised as Mentor, to set right the world of Ithaca. The final covenant is her work, authorised by Zeus's bolt at her feet.

[^od18-penelope]: "Her fair face first she steeped with beauty imperishable, such as that wherewith the crowned Cytherea is anointed, when she goes to the lovely dances of the Graces. And she made her taller and greater to behold, and made her whiter than new-sawn ivory." (Odyssey XVIII.9894-9897, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od22-mentor]: "Athene, daughter of Zeus, drew nigh them, like Mentor in fashion and in voice, and Odysseus was glad when he saw her" (Odyssey XXII.11869-11870, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od22-chide]: "Odysseus, thou hast no more steadfast might nor any prowess, as when for nine whole years continually thou didst battle with the Trojans for high born Helen, of the white arms, and many men thou slewest in terrible warfare, and by thy device the wide-wayed city of Priam was taken. How then, now that thou art come to thy house and thine own possessions, dost thou bewail thee and art of feeble courage to stand before the wooers?" (Odyssey XXII.11892-11898, trans. Butcher and Lang)

Butcher and Lang)

### Disguised as Mentor; Launching the Voyage (Book II)

Athena continues to support Telemachus in Book II. At the assembly, "Athene shed on him a wondrous grace, and all the people marvelled at him as he came."[^od2-grace]

When Telemachus prays at the shore, Athena comes "in the likeness of Mentor, in fashion and in voice" — the mortal companion Odysseus had entrusted with his house.[^od2-mentor] She encourages him and promises to furnish a ship. Then "in the likeness of Telemachus she went all through the city" gathering a crew and securing a ship.[^od2-telemachus] She sheds sleep on the wooers to cover the departure, and once aboard, "grey-eyed Athene sent them a favourable gale, a fresh West Wind, singing over the wine-dark sea."[^od2-wind]

[^od2-grace]: "Athene shed on him a wondrous grace, and all the people marvelled at him as he came" (Odyssey II.1182-1183, trans. Butcher and Lang)

[^od2-wind]: "grey-eyed Athene sent them a favourable gale, a fresh West Wind, singing over the wine-dark sea" (Odyssey II.1596-1598, trans. Butcher and Lang)

[^od1-advocate]: "my heart is rent for wise Odysseus, that hapless one, who far from his friends this long while suffereth affliction in a seagirt isle, where is the navel of the sea, a woodland isle, and therein a goddess hath her habitation, the daughter of the wizard Atlas, who knows the depths of every sea, and himself upholds the tall pillars which keep earth and sky asunder. His daughter it is that holds the hapless man in sorrow... What! did not Odysseus by the ships of the Argives make thee free offering of sacrifice in the wide Trojan land? Wherefore wast thou then so wroth with him, O Zeus?" (Odyssey I.774-786, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od1-plan]: "if indeed this thing is now well pleasing to the blessed gods, that wise Odysseus should return to his own home, let us then speed Hermes the Messenger, the slayer of Argos, to the island of Ogygia... But as for me I will go to Ithaca that I may rouse his son yet the more, planting might in his heart" (Odyssey I.805-812, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od1-equip]: "She bound beneath her feet her lovely golden sandals that wax not old, and bare her alike over the wet sea and over the limitless land, swift as the breath of the wind. And she seized her doughty spear, shod with sharp bronze, weighty and huge and strong, wherewith she quells the ranks of heroes with whomsoever she is wroth, the daughter of the mighty sire."

[^od1-eagle]: "like an eagle of the sea she flew away, but in his spirit she planted might and courage, and put him in mind of his father yet more than heretofore. And he marked the thing and was amazed, for he deemed that it was a god" (Odyssey I.1036-1039, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od1-sleep]: "grey-eyed Athene cast sweet sleep upon her eyelids" (Odyssey I.1077, trans. Butcher and Lang)

## In the Shield of Heracles

In the [Shield of Heracles](../sources/shield-of-heracles.md), Athena plays a crucial role in [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md)' battle against Cycnus and [Ares](ares.md). She gives Heracles his golden breastplate ("a fine golden breast-plate, curiously wrought, which Pallas Athene the daughter of Zeus had given him when first he was about to set out upon his grievous labours").[^sh-gift]

She counsels him to wound Ares where exposed beneath his shield, then joins the battle: "the goddess grey-eyed Athene came near them and spoke winged words, encouraging them." She rides in the chariot, "shaking her aegis," and when Ares hurls his spear, "bright-eyed Athene reached out from the car and turned aside the force of the spear."[^sh-battle]

When Ares refuses to withdraw, she rebukes him: "Ares, check your fierce anger and matchless hands; for it is not ordained that you should kill Heracles, the bold-hearted son of Zeus."[^sh-rebuke]

On the shield itself, Athena is depicted armed: "the daughter of Zeus, Tritogeneia who drives the spoil. She was like as if she would array a battle, with a spear in her hand, and a golden helmet, and the [aegis](../objects/aegis.md) about her shoulders."[^sh-shield-athena]

[^sh-gift]: "he fastened about his breast a fine golden breast-plate, curiously wrought, which Pallas Athene the daughter of Zeus had given him when first he was about to set out upon his grievous labours" (Shield of Heracles 122-126, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^sh-battle]: "bright-eyed Athene reached out from the car and turned aside the force of the spear" (Shield of Heracles 451-452)
[^sh-rebuke]: "Ares, check your fierce anger and matchless hands; for it is not ordained that you should kill Heracles, the bold-hearted son of Zeus, and strip off his rich armour. Come, then, cease fighting and do not withstand me" (Shield of Heracles 443-449)
[^sh-shield-athena]: "the daughter of Zeus, Tritogeneia who drives the spoil. She was like as if she would array a battle, with a spear in her hand, and a golden helmet, and the aegis about her shoulders. And she was going towards the awful strife" (Shield of Heracles 197-200)

## In the Iliad

### Restraining Achilles (Book I)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book I, when Achilles is about to draw his sword against Agamemnon, "Athene came to him from heaven, sent forth of the white-armed goddess [Hera](hera.md), whose heart loved both alike and had care for them. She stood behind Peleus' son and caught him by his golden hair, to him only visible, and of the rest no man beheld her." Achilles "straightway knew Pallas Athene; and terribly shone her eyes."[^il1-restrain]

She promised him: "hereafter shall goodly gifts come to thee, yea in threefold measure, by reason of this despite; hold thou thine hand, and hearken to us."[^il1-promise]

### Stopping the Retreat and the Aegis (Book II)

When the Greeks rush to flee after Agamemnon's test, [Hera](hera.md) sends Athena to stop them. She goes to Odysseus, speaking to him directly (he "knew the voice of the goddess"), and through him rallies the army.[^il2-retreat]

She then marches with the army bearing her aegis: "bright-eyed Athene in the midst, bearing the holy aegis that knoweth neither age nor death, whereon wave an hundred tassels of pure gold, all deftly woven and each one an hundred oxen worth. Therewith she passed dazzling through the Achaian folk, urging them forth; and in every man's heart she roused strength to battle."[^il2-aegis]

### Fostering Erechtheus (Book II)

In the Catalogue of Ships, Athens is described as "the domain of Erechtheus the high-hearted, whom erst Athene daughter of Zeus fostered when Earth, the grain-giver, brought him to birth; and she gave him a resting-place in Athens in her own rich sanctuary."[^il2-erechtheus]

[^il1-restrain]: "Athene came to him from heaven, sent forth of the white-armed goddess Hera, whose heart loved both alike and had care for them. She stood behind Peleus' son and caught him by his golden hair, to him only visible, and of the rest no man beheld her. Then Achilles marvelled, and turned him about, and straightway knew Pallas Athene; and terribly shone her eyes" (Iliad I.195-200, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il1-promise]: "hereafter shall goodly gifts come to thee, yea in threefold measure, by reason of this despite; hold thou thine hand, and hearken to us" (Iliad I.213-214)
[^il2-retreat]: "bright-eyed Athene stood by him and said: 'Heaven-sprung son of Laertes, Odysseus of many devices, will ye indeed fling yourselves upon your benched ships to flee homeward to your dear native land?'" (Iliad II.946-948, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il2-aegis]: "bright-eyed Athene in the midst, bearing the holy aegis that knoweth neither age nor death, whereon wave an hundred tassels of pure gold, all deftly woven and each one an hundred oxen worth. Therewith she passed dazzling through the Achaian folk, urging them forth; and in every man's heart she roused strength to battle without ceasing and to fight" (Iliad II.1197-1202)
[^il2-erechtheus]: "the goodly citadel of Athens, the domain of Erechtheus the high-hearted, whom erst Athene daughter of Zeus fostered when Earth, the grain-giver, brought him to birth; and she gave him a resting-place in Athens in her own rich sanctuary; and there the sons of the Athenians worship him with bulls and rams as the years turn in their courses" (Iliad II.1282-1287)

### Denying Troy's Prayer (Book VI)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book VI, the Trojans pray to Athena in desperation. Hector instructs his mother Hekabe to gather the aged wives and offer "the robe that seemeth to her the most gracious and greatest in her hall" upon the knees of "beauteous-haired Athene" along with a vow of twelve unbroken kine, "if she will have mercy on the city and the Trojans' wives and little children."[^il6-prayer-request]

The priestess Theano places the fairest robe on Athena's knees and prays: "Lady Athene, saviour of the city, fair among goddesses, break now Diomedes' spear, and grant moreover that himself may fall prone before the Skaian gates." But: "So spake she praying, but Pallas Athene denied the prayer."[^il6-denied]

[^il6-prayer-request]: "let her lay the robe, that seemeth to her the most gracious and greatest in her hall and far dearest unto herself, upon the knees of beauteous-haired Athene; and vow to her to sacrifice in her temple twelve sleek kine, that have not felt the goad, if she will have mercy on the city and the Trojans' wives and little children" (Iliad VI.3544-3549, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il6-denied]: "Lady Athene, saviour of the city, fair among goddesses, break now Diomedes' spear, and grant moreover that himself may fall prone before the Skaian gates; that we may sacrifice thee now forthwith in thy temple twelve sleek kine, that have not felt the goad, if thou wilt have mercy on the city and the Trojans' wives and little children. So spake she praying, but Pallas Athene denied the prayer." (Iliad VI.3749-3754)

## In the Bibliotheca (1.6.1-1.6.2)

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) assigns Athena a major role in the [Gigantomachy](../creatures/giants.md). She summoned [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) at [Zeus](zeus.md)'s command, and advised him to drag Alcyoneus outside Pallene to prevent his revival.[^apd-ath-alcyoneus] She threw "the island of Sicily" upon the fleeing Enceladus, and "flayed Pallas and used his skin to shield her own body in the fight."[^apd-ath-pallas]

> **NEW DETAIL:** Athena flaying the Giant Pallas and using his skin as a shield may be connected to her epithet "Pallas Athena" — though the text does not make this connection explicitly.

[^apd-ath-alcyoneus]: "at Athena's advice Hercules dragged him outside Pallene, and so the giant died." (Bibliotheca 1.6.1, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-ath-pallas]: "Enceladus fled, but Athena threw on him in his flight the island of Sicily; and she flayed Pallas and used his skin to shield her own body in the fight." (Bibliotheca 1.6.2, trans. Frazer)

## In the Bibliotheca (Book 2)

### Danaus and the Danaids

Athena advised Danaus to build a ship when he fled the sons of Egyptus — "by the advice of Athena he built a ship, being the first to do so."[^apd-ath-danaus] After the Danaids murdered their bridegrooms, "Athena and [Hermes](hermes.md) purified them at the command of [Zeus](zeus.md)."[^apd-ath-purify]

### Guiding Perseus

Athena guided [Perseus](../heroes/perseus.md) in his quest to slay Medusa. She accompanied him alongside [Hermes](hermes.md) to the daughters of Phorcus. During the slaying itself, "Athena guided his hand and he looked with averted gaze on a brazen shield, in which he beheld the image of the Gorgon."[^apd-ath-perseus]

After Perseus returned, "the Gorgon's head he gave to Athena." She "inserted the Gorgon's head in the middle of her shield."[^apd-ath-gorgon-shield] A variant tradition states "that Medusa was beheaded for Athena's sake; and they say that the Gorgon was fain to match herself with the goddess even in beauty."[^apd-ath-gorgon-beauty]

### Aiding Heracles

Athena continued her role as [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md)' protector:
- Gave him weapons before the battle with Erginus: "Hercules, having received weapons from Athena and taken the command, killed Erginus."[^apd-ath-erginus]
- For the Stymphalian Birds, "Athena gave him brazen castanets, which she had received from [Hephaestus](hephaestus.md)."[^apd-ath-castanets]
- Brought him to Phlegra to fight in the [Gigantomachy](../creatures/giants.md): "he came through Athena's agency to Phlegra, and sided with the gods."[^apd-ath-phlegra]
- Gave him "a lock of the Gorgon's hair in a bronze jar" to use as a weapon against enemies.[^apd-ath-gorgon-lock]
- Returned the golden apples to the [Hesperides](../creatures/echidna.md): "[Athena](athena.md) got them and conveyed them back again; for it was not lawful that they should be laid down anywhere."[^apd-ath-apples]

[^apd-ath-danaus]: "by the advice of Athena he built a ship, being the first to do so" (Bibliotheca 2.1.4, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-ath-purify]: "Athena and Hermes purified them at the command of Zeus" (Bibliotheca 2.1.5)
[^apd-ath-perseus]: "Athena guided his hand and he looked with averted gaze on a brazen shield, in which he beheld the image of the Gorgon, he beheaded her" (Bibliotheca 2.4.2)
[^apd-ath-gorgon-shield]: "the Gorgon's head he gave to Athena... Athena inserted the Gorgon's head in the middle of her shield" (Bibliotheca 2.4.3)
[^apd-ath-gorgon-beauty]: "it is alleged by some that Medusa was beheaded for Athena's sake; and they say that the Gorgon was fain to match herself with the goddess even in beauty" (Bibliotheca 2.4.3)
[^apd-ath-erginus]: "Hercules, having received weapons from Athena and taken the command, killed Erginus, put the Minyans to flight" (Bibliotheca 2.4.11)
[^apd-ath-castanets]: "Athena gave him brazen castanets, which she had received from Hephaestus" (Bibliotheca 2.5.6)
[^apd-ath-phlegra]: "he came through Athena's agency to Phlegra, and sided with the gods in their victorious war on the giants" (Bibliotheca 2.7.1)
[^apd-ath-gorgon-lock]: "Hercules had received from Athena a lock of the Gorgon's hair in a bronze jar and gave it to Sterope, daughter of Cepheus" (Bibliotheca 2.7.3)
[^apd-ath-apples]: "Athena got them and conveyed them back again; for it was not lawful that they should be laid down anywhere" (Bibliotheca 2.5.11)
