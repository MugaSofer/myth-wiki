## Overview

**Pan** is the goat-footed god of shepherds and wild places, son of [Hermes](hermes.md).

## Description

Pan has "goat's feet and two horns — a lover of merry noise. Through wooded glades he wanders with dancing nymphs who foot it on some sheer cliff's edge." He has "every snowy crest and the mountain peaks and rocky crests for his domain." On his back "he wears a spotted lynx-pelt."[^hh19-desc]

"Only at evening, as he returns from the chase, he sounds his note, playing sweet and low on his pipes of reed: not even she could excel him in melody — that bird who in flower-laden spring pouring forth her lament utters honey-voiced song amid the leaves."[^hh19-pipes]

[^hh19-desc]: "Muse, tell me about Pan, the dear son of Hermes, with his goat's feet and two horns—a lover of merry noise. Through wooded glades he wanders with dancing nymphs who foot it on some sheer cliff's edge, calling upon Pan, the shepherd-god, long-haired, unkempt. He has every snowy crest and the mountain peaks and rocky crests for his domain" (Homeric Hymn XIX to Pan 1-7, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^hh19-pipes]: "Only at evening, as he returns from the chase, he sounds his note, playing sweet and low on his pipes of reed: not even she could excel him in melody—that bird who in flower-laden spring pouring forth her lament utters honey-voiced song amid the leaves" (Homeric Hymn XIX to Pan 15-18)

## Birth

[Hermes](hermes.md) "came to Arcadia, the land of many springs and mother of flocks, there where his sacred place is as god of Cyllene. For there, though a god, he used to tend curly-fleeced sheep in the service of a mortal man, because there fell on him and waxed strong melting desire to wed the rich-tressed daughter of Dryops."[^hh19-hermes]

"In the house she bare [Hermes](hermes.md) a dear son who from his birth was marvellous to look upon, with goat's feet and two horns — a noisy, merry-laughing child. But when the nurse saw his uncouth face and full beard, she was afraid and sprang up and fled and left the child."[^hh19-birth]

Hermes "went quickly to the abodes of the deathless gods, carrying the son wrapped in warm skins of mountain hares, and set him down beside [Zeus](zeus.md) and showed him to the rest of the gods. Then all the immortals were glad in heart and Bacchic [Dionysus](dionysus.md) in especial; and they called the boy Pan because he delighted all their hearts."[^hh19-name]

## In the Bibliotheca (1.4.1)

### Variant Parentage and Teaching Apollo Prophecy

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) names Pan as "the son of [Zeus](zeus.md) and Hybris," from whom [Apollo](apollo.md) "learned the art of prophecy."[^apd-pan-parent]

> **VARIANT:** [Homeric Hymn XIX](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) makes Pan the son of [Hermes](hermes.md) and a daughter of Dryops. The Bibliotheca's parentage — Zeus and Hybris (a personification of hubris/insolence) — is strikingly different and otherwise unattested in our sources. The role of teaching Apollo prophecy is also unique to this account.

[^apd-pan-parent]: "Apollo learned the art of prophecy from Pan, the son of Zeus and Hybris" (Bibliotheca 1.4.1, trans. Frazer)

## In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md)

### Pan and Syrinx (1.689-712)

The story of Pan and Syrinx is told within the Metamorphoses as a tale [Hermes](hermes.md) (Mercury) narrates to lull Argus to sleep. "A famous Naiad dwelt among the Hamadryads, on the cold Arcadian summit Nonacris, whose name was Syrinx. Often she escaped the Gods, that wandered in the groves of sylvan shades, and often fled from Satyrs that pursued."[^met-pan-syrinx] She modelled herself on [Artemis](artemis.md) (Diana): "Vowing virginity, in all pursuits she strove to emulate Diana's ways: and as that graceful goddess wears her robe, so Syrinx girded hers."[^met-pan-diana]

Pan, "whose head was girt with prickly pines," saw her returning from the Lycian Hill and pursued her. She fled to the river Ladon, where "she implored her sister Nymphs to change her form: and Pan, believing he had caught her, held instead some marsh reeds for the body of the Nymph."[^met-pan-reeds] The wind through the reeds produced a sweet sound, and Pan fashioned them into his instrument: "Forever this discovery shall remain a sweet communion binding thee to me."[^met-pan-pipes]

### Musical Contest with Apollo (11.146-193)

After [Midas](../heroes/midas.md) lost his golden touch, he "inhabited the woods and fields, and followed Pan who dwells always in mountain-caves." Pan boasted of his superiority to [Apollo](apollo.md) and agreed to a contest judged by the mountain-god Tmolus.[^met-pan-contest] Pan "made some rustic sounds on his rough reeds, delighting Midas with his uncouth notes." But when Apollo played — wearing Parnassian laurel, a robe of Tyrian purple, holding a lyre "adorned with gems and Indian ivory" — Tmolus "ordered Pan to hold his reeds excelled by beauty of Apollo's lyre."[^met-pan-judged]

Midas alone disputed the verdict, and Apollo transformed his ears into those of a donkey.[^met-pan-midas]

[^met-pan-syrinx]: "A famous Naiad dwelt among the Hamadryads, on the cold Arcadian summit Nonacris, whose name was Syrinx. Often she escaped the Gods, that wandered in the groves of sylvan shades, and often fled from Satyrs that pursued" (Metamorphoses 1.689-693, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-pan-diana]: "Vowing virginity, in all pursuits she strove to emulate Diana's ways: and as that graceful goddess wears her robe, so Syrinx girded hers that one might well believe Diana there" (Metamorphoses 1.694-697)
[^met-pan-reeds]: "she implored her sister Nymphs to change her form: and Pan, believing he had caught her, held instead some marsh reeds for the body of the Nymph" (Metamorphoses 1.705-707)
[^met-pan-pipes]: "Forever this discovery shall remain a sweet communion binding thee to me" (Metamorphoses 1.709-710)
[^met-pan-contest]: "While Pan was boasting there to mountain nymphs of his great skill in music... he dared to boast to them how he despised Apollo's music when compared with his" (Metamorphoses 11.152-157)
[^met-pan-judged]: "Pan made some rustic sounds on his rough reeds, delighting Midas with his uncouth notes... Tmolus ordered Pan to hold his reeds excelled by beauty of Apollo's lyre" (Metamorphoses 11.166-180)
[^met-pan-midas]: "That judgment of the sacred mountain god pleased all those present, all but Midas, who blaming Tmolus called the award unjust. The Delian god forbids his stupid ears to hold their native human shape" (Metamorphoses 11.172-175)
