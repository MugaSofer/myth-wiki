## Overview

**Pan** is the goat-footed god of shepherds and wild places, son of [Hermes](hermes.md).

## Description

Pan has "goat's feet and two horns — a lover of merry noise. Through wooded glades he wanders with dancing nymphs who foot it on some sheer cliff's edge." He has "every snowy crest and the mountain peaks and rocky crests for his domain." On his back "he wears a spotted lynx-pelt."[^hh19-desc]

"Only at evening, as he returns from the chase, he sounds his note, playing sweet and low on his pipes of reed: not even she could excel him in melody — that bird who in flower-laden spring pouring forth her lament utters honey-voiced song amid the leaves."[^hh19-pipes]

[^hh19-desc]: "Muse, tell me about Pan, the dear son of Hermes, with his goat's feet and two horns—a lover of merry noise. Through wooded glades he wanders with dancing nymphs who foot it on some sheer cliff's edge, calling upon Pan, the shepherd-god, long-haired, unkempt. He has every snowy crest and the mountain peaks and rocky crests for his domain" (Homeric Hymn XIX to Pan 1-7, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^hh19-pipes]: "Only at evening, as he returns from the chase, he sounds his note, playing sweet and low on his pipes of reed: not even she could excel him in melody—that bird who in flower-laden spring pouring forth her lament utters honey-voiced song amid the leaves" (Homeric Hymn XIX to Pan 15-18)

## Birth

[Hermes](hermes.md) "came to Arcadia, the land of many springs and mother of flocks, there where his sacred place is as god of Cyllene. For there, though a god, he used to tend curly-fleeced sheep in the service of a mortal man, because there fell on him and waxed strong melting desire to wed the rich-tressed daughter of Dryops."[^hh19-hermes]

"In the house she bare [Hermes](hermes.md) a dear son who from his birth was marvellous to look upon, with goat's feet and two horns — a noisy, merry-laughing child. But when the nurse saw his uncouth face and full beard, she was afraid and sprang up and fled and left the child."[^hh19-birth]

Hermes "went quickly to the abodes of the deathless gods, carrying the son wrapped in warm skins of mountain hares, and set him down beside [Zeus](zeus.md) and showed him to the rest of the gods. Then all the immortals were glad in heart and Bacchic [Dionysus](dionysus.md) in especial; and they called the boy Pan because he delighted all their hearts."[^hh19-name]

[^hh19-hermes]: "he came to Arcadia, the land of many springs and mother of flocks, there where his sacred place is as god of Cyllene. For there, though a god, he used to tend curly-fleeced sheep in the service of a mortal man, because there fell on him and waxed strong melting desire to wed the rich-tressed daughter of Dryops" (Homeric Hymn XIX to Pan 30-35)
[^hh19-birth]: "in the house she bare Hermes a dear son who from his birth was marvellous to look upon, with goat's feet and two horns—a noisy, merry-laughing child.

[^hh19-name]: "all the immortals were glad in heart and Bacchic Dionysus in especial; and they called the boy Pan because he delighted all their hearts" (Homeric Hymn XIX to Pan 45-47)

## In the Bibliotheca (1.4.1)

### Variant Parentage and Teaching Apollo Prophecy

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) names Pan as "the son of [Zeus](zeus.md) and Hybris," from whom [Apollo](apollo.md) "learned the art of prophecy."[^apd-pan-parent]

> **VARIANT:** [Homeric Hymn XIX](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) makes Pan the son of [Hermes](hermes.md) and a daughter of Dryops. The Bibliotheca's parentage — Zeus and Hybris (a personification of hubris/insolence) — is strikingly different and otherwise unattested in our sources. The role of teaching Apollo prophecy is also unique to this account.

[^apd-pan-parent]: "Apollo learned the art of prophecy from Pan, the son of Zeus and Hybris" (Bibliotheca 1.4.1, trans. Frazer)
