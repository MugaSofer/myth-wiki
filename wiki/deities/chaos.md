## Overview

**Chaos** was the first being to come into existence. In Hesiod's [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md), Chaos precedes all other entities, including [Earth](gaia.md), [Tartarus](../places/tartarus.md), and [Eros](eros.md).

## Cosmogonic Role

"Verily at the first Chaos came to be."[^theog-chaos] The text presents Chaos as the very first entity, from which the other primordial beings followed — though they are not described as being *born from* Chaos, only as coming to be after it, with the exception of Chaos's own children.

[^theog-chaos]: "Verily at the first Chaos came to be" (Theogony 116, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Children

From Chaos came forth [Erebus](erebus.md) and black [Night](night.md).[^theog-children]

[^theog-children]: "From Chaos came forth Erebus and black Night" (Theogony 123)
