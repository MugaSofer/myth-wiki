## Overview

**Zeus** is the king of the gods, ruling from [Olympus](../places/olympus.md). In the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md), he is referred to frequently by his epithets before his birth narrative, reflecting his ultimate supremacy among the gods.

## Epithets

Zeus accumulates more epithets than any other figure across the sources:

- **"the aegis-holder"** / **"who holds the aegis"** — the most frequent (Theogony 11, 13, 25, and throughout)
- **"the loud-thunderer"** / **"who delights in thunder"** — (Theogony 41; Hymn III 2; Hymn XII 4)
- **"the almighty son of Cronos"** — (Theogony 4)
- **"far-seeing Zeus"** / **"far-seeing Olympian Zeus"** — used in council and judgment (Theogony 457, 884; [Works and Days](../sources/theogony.md) 169c, 267)
- **"the dark-clouded Son of Cronos"** / **"Zeus who drives the clouds"** — (Hymn to Demeter 316, 321; Theogony 558)
- **"father of men and gods"** — used at moments of supreme authority (Theogony 457, 542, 838, 897)

In the Hymn to Hermes, when his infant son denies stealing cattle, "Zeus laughed out loud" — one of the few physical responses described.[^desc-laugh]

[^desc-laugh]: "Zeus laughed out loud to see his evil-plotting child well and cunningly denying guilt about the cattle" (Homeric Hymn IV to Hermes 389-390, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Appearance

Zeus is rarely described physically, known more through his effects than his form. The most vivid image comes from the nod that seals his oaths: "Kronion spake, and bowed his dark brow, and the ambrosial locks waved from the king's immortal head; and he made great [Olympus](../places/olympus.md) quake."[^il1-nod]

When he seduces [Hera](hera.md) on Mount Ida, he wraps them both in concealment: "a fair golden cloud, whence fell drops of glittering dew."[^il14-earth]

His instruments are described as extensions of himself: the [golden scales](../objects/golden-scales.md) with which he weighs fates,[^il8-scales] and the [thunderbolt](../objects/thunderbolt.md), with which he descends "from heaven" to sit on Ida.[^il11-iris]

## Domains & Powers

Zeus holds "the lightning and glowing [thunderbolt](../objects/thunderbolt.md)," having "overcome by might his father [Cronos](cronos.md)," after which "he distributed fairly to the immortals their portions and declared their privileges."[^theog-rule] The thunderbolt was given to him by the [Cyclopes](../creatures/cyclopes.md).[^theog-cyclopes]

It is "through the [Muses](muses.md) and far-shooting [Apollo](apollo.md) that there are singers and harpers upon the earth; but princes are of Zeus."[^theog-princes]

[^theog-rule]: "he was reigning in heaven, himself holding the lightning and glowing thunderbolt, when he had overcome by might his father Cronos; and he distributed fairly to the immortals their portions and declared their privileges" (Theogony 71-74, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^theog-cyclopes]: "who gave Zeus the thunder and made the thunderbolt" (Theogony 141)
[^theog-princes]: "For it is through the Muses and far-shooting Apollo that there are singers and harpers upon the earth; but princes are of Zeus" (Theogony 94-96)

## Birth

[Cronos](cronos.md) swallowed each of his children as they were born, having learned from [Gaia](gaia.md) and [Uranus](uranus.md) "that he was destined to be overcome by his own son."[^theog-prophecy] When [Rhea](rhea.md) was about to bear Zeus, she conspired with her parents. She was sent to Lyctus in Crete, where Gaia "took him in her arms and hid him in a remote cave beneath the secret places of the holy earth on thick-wooded Mount Aegeum."[^theog-cave] Cronos was given a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes instead.[^theog-stone]

Zeus was "the youngest of her children" — his siblings, swallowed before him, were [Hestia](hestia.md), [Demeter](demeter.md), [Hera](hera.md) ("gold-shod"), [Hades](hades.md) ("strong... pitiless in heart, who dwells under the earth"), and [Poseidon](poseidon.md) ("the loud-crashing Earth-Shaker").[^theog-siblings]

[^theog-prophecy]: "he learned from Earth and starry Heaven that he was destined to be overcome by his own son, strong though he was, through the contriving of great Zeus" (Theogony 463-464)
[^theog-cave]: "Thither came Earth carrying him swiftly through the black night to Lyctus first, and took him in her arms and hid him in a remote cave beneath the secret places of the holy earth on thick-wooded Mount Aegeum" (Theogony 477-480)
[^theog-stone]: "to the mightily ruling son of Heaven, the earlier king of the gods, she gave a great stone wrapped in swaddling clothes. Then he took it in his hands and thrust it down into his belly: wretch! he knew not in his heart that in place of the stone his son was left behind" (Theogony 481-485)
[^theog-siblings]: "Rhea was subject in love to Cronos and bare splendid children, Hestia, Demeter, and gold-shod Hera and strong Hades, pitiless in heart, who dwells under the earth, and the loud-crashing Earth-Shaker, and wise Zeus, father of gods and men, by whose thunder the wide earth is shaken" (Theogony 453-458)

## Genealogy

### Consorts and Children (Theogony 886-944)

Zeus's consorts are listed in order in the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md):[^theog-consorts]

1. **Metis** — "wisest among gods and mortal men." When she was about to bear [Athena](athena.md), Zeus "craftily deceived her with cunning words and put her in his own belly, as [Earth](gaia.md) and starry [Heaven](uranus.md) advised," because "very wise children were destined to be born of her" including a son who would be "king of gods and men."[^theog-metis]
2. **[Themis](themis.md)** — bore the Horae (Hours): Eunomia (Order), Dike (Justice), and Eirene (Peace); and the Moerae (Fates): Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos.[^theog-themis]
3. **Eurynome** (daughter of [Oceanus](oceanus.md)) — bore the three Charites (Graces): Aglaea, Euphrosyne, and Thaleia.[^theog-graces]
4. **[Demeter](demeter.md)** — bore "white-armed [Persephone](persephone.md) whom Aidoneus [[Hades](hades.md)] carried off from her mother; but wise Zeus gave her to him."[^theog-demeter]
5. **[Mnemosyne](mnemosyne.md)** — bore "the nine gold-crowned [Muses](muses.md) who delight in feasts and the pleasures of song."[^theog-muses]
6. **Leto** — bore "[Apollo](apollo.md) and [Artemis](artemis.md) delighting in arrows, children lovely above all the sons of Heaven."[^theog-leto]
7. **[Hera](hera.md)** (final wife) — "brought forth Hebe and [Ares](ares.md) and Eileithyia."[^theog-hera]

[^theog-consorts]: "Now Zeus, king of the gods, made Metis his wife first, and she was wisest among gods and mortal men" (Theogony 886-923)
[^theog-metis]: "Zeus craftily deceived her with cunning words and put her in his own belly, as Earth and starry Heaven advised. For they advised him so, to the end that no other should hold royal sway over the eternal gods in place of Zeus; for very wise children were destined to be born of her" (Theogony 886-900)
[^theog-themis]: "Next he married bright Themis who bare the Horae (Hours), and Eunomia (Order), Dike (Justice), and blooming Eirene (Peace), who mind the works of mortal men, and the Moerae (Fates) to whom wise Zeus gave the greatest honour, Clotho, and Lachesis, and Atropos who give mortal men evil and good to have" (Theogony 901-906)
[^theog-graces]: "Eurynome, the daughter of Ocean, beautiful in form, bare him three fair-cheeked Charites (Graces), Aglaea, and Euphrosyne, and lovely Thaleia, from whose eyes as they glanced flowed love that unnerves the limbs" (Theogony 907-911)
[^theog-demeter]: "Also he came to the bed of all-nourishing Demeter, and she bare white-armed Persephone whom Aidoneus carried off from her mother; but wise Zeus gave her to him" (Theogony 912-914)
[^theog-muses]: "he loved Mnemosyne with the beautiful hair: and of her the nine gold-crowned Muses were born who delight in feasts and the pleasures of song" (Theogony 915-917)
[^theog-leto]: "Leto was joined in love with Zeus who holds the aegis, and bare Apollo and Artemis delighting in arrows, children lovely above all the sons of Heaven" (Theogony 918-920)
[^theog-hera]: "Lastly, he made Hera his blooming wife: and she was joined in love with the king of gods and men, and brought forth Hebe and Ares and Eileithyia" (Theogony 921-923)

### Birth of Athena

"Zeus himself gave birth from his own head to bright-eyed Tritogeneia, the awful, the strife-stirring, the host-leader, the unwearying, the queen, who delights in tumults and wars and battles."[^theog-athena]

[^theog-athena]: "Zeus himself gave birth from his own head to bright-eyed Tritogeneia, the awful, the strife-stirring, the host-leader, the unwearying, the queen, who delights in tumults and wars and battles" (Theogony 924-926)

### Other Children

- With **Maia** (daughter of Atlas): "[Hermes](hermes.md), the herald of the deathless gods"[^theog-hermes]
- With **Semele** (daughter of Cadmus): "joyous [Dionysus](dionysus.md),—a mortal woman an immortal son. And now they both are gods."[^theog-dion]
- With **Alcmena**: "mighty [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md)"[^theog-heracles]

[^theog-hermes]: "Maia, the daughter of Atlas, bare to Zeus glorious Hermes, the herald of the deathless gods, for she went up into his holy bed" (Theogony 938-939)
[^theog-dion]: "Semele, daughter of Cadmus was joined with him in love and bare him a splendid son, joyous Dionysus,—a mortal woman an immortal son. And now they both are gods" (Theogony 940-942)
[^theog-heracles]: "Alcmena was joined in love with Zeus who drives the clouds and bare mighty Heracles" (Theogony 943-944)

## Mythology

### Rise to Power

After the deception, Cronos's son was "left behind, unconquered and untroubled, and... he was soon to overcome him by force and might and drive him from his honours, himself to reign over the deathless gods."[^theog-rise]

Before the battle with the [Titans](titans.md), Zeus called "all the deathless gods to great [Olympus](../places/olympus.md), and said that whosoever of the gods would fight with him against the Titans, he would not cast him out from his rights." Styx was the first to answer, bringing her children (Zelus, Nike, Cratos, Bia), and was rewarded by being made "the great oath of the gods."[^theog-styx]

[^theog-rise]: "his son was left behind, unconquered and untroubled, and that he was soon to overcome him by force and might and drive him from his honours, himself to reign over the deathless gods" (Theogony 485-491)
[^theog-styx]: "whosoever of the gods would fight with him against the Titans, he would not cast him out from his rights, but each should have the office which he had before amongst the deathless gods... So deathless Styx came first to Olympus with her children through the wit of her dear father. And Zeus honoured her, and gave her very great gifts, for her he appointed to be the great oath of the gods" (Theogony 389-401)

### Freeing His Siblings

Cronos "was beguiled by the deep suggestions of [Earth](gaia.md), and brought up again his offspring, vanquished by the arts and might of his own son, and he vomited up first the stone which he had swallowed last." Zeus set the stone "in the wide-pathed earth at goodly Pytho under the glens of Parnassus, to be a sign thenceforth and a marvel to mortal men."[^theog-stone2] He also freed the [Cyclopes](../creatures/cyclopes.md), who in gratitude "gave him thunder and the glowing thunderbolt and lightening: for before that, huge Earth had hidden these."[^theog-thunder]

[^theog-stone2]: "great Cronos the wily was beguiled by the deep suggestions of Earth, and brought up again his offspring, vanquished by the arts and might of his own son, and he vomited up first the stone which he had swallowed last. And Zeus set it fast in the wide-pathed earth at goodly Pytho under the glens of Parnassus, to be a sign thenceforth and a marvel to mortal men" (Theogony 492-497)
[^theog-thunder]: "they remembered to be grateful to him for his kindness, and gave him thunder and the glowing thunderbolt and lightening: for before that, huge Earth had hidden these. In them he trusts and rules over mortals and immortals" (Theogony 501-506)

### The Titanomachy

See [Titanomachy](../events/titanomachy.md). Zeus led the Olympian gods against the [Titans](titans.md) in a ten-year war, winning with the help of the [Hundred-Handers](../creatures/hundred-handers.md) and his thunderbolt.[^theog-titan]

[^theog-titan]: "the Titan gods and as many as sprang from Cronos had long been fighting together in stubborn war with heart-grieving toil... Then Zeus no longer held back his might; but straight his heart was filled with fury and he showed forth all his strength" (Theogony 617-735)

### Defeat of Typhoeus

After the [Titanomachy](../events/titanomachy.md), [Gaia](gaia.md) bore [Typhoeus](../creatures/typhoeus.md), who nearly overthrew Zeus's rule. Zeus defeated him with thunder and lightning and cast him into [Tartarus](../places/tartarus.md).[^theog-typhoeus]

[^theog-typhoeus]: "when Zeus had driven the Titans from heaven, huge Earth bare her youngest child Typhoeus of the love of Tartarus... So when Zeus had raised up his might and seized his arms, thunder and lightning and lurid thunderbolt, he leaped from Olympus and struck him" (Theogony 820-868)

### Establishing His Rule

"When the blessed gods had finished their toil, and settled by force their struggle for honours with the Titans, they pressed far-seeing Olympian Zeus to reign and to rule over them, by Earth's prompting. So he divided their dignities amongst them."[^theog-divide]

[^theog-divide]: "when the blessed gods had finished their toil, and settled by force their struggle for honours with the Titans, they pressed far-seeing Olympian Zeus to reign and to rule over them, by Earth's prompting. So he divided their dignities amongst them" (Theogony 881-885)

## In the Odyssey

### Mortal Responsibility (Book I)

In the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md), Zeus opens the poem's divine action with a theological speech. While the gods are gathered on [Olympus](../places/olympus.md) (with [Poseidon](poseidon.md) away among the Ethiopians), Zeus reflects on Aegisthus, who murdered Agamemnon despite divine warning:

"Lo you now, how vainly mortal men do blame the gods! For of us they say comes evil, whereas they even of themselves, through the blindness of their own hearts, have sorrows beyond that which is ordained. Even as of late Aegisthus, beyond that which was ordained, took to him the wedded wife of the son of Atreus, and killed her lord on his return, and that with sheer doom before his eyes, since we had warned him by the embassy of [Hermes](hermes.md) the keen-sighted, the slayer of Argos, that he should neither kill the man, nor woo his wife."[^od1-aegisthus]

When [Athena](athena.md) advocates for Odysseus, Zeus readily agrees — "Yea, how should I forget divine Odysseus, who in understanding is beyond mortals and beyond all men hath done sacrifice to the deathless gods?" — and identifies [Poseidon](poseidon.md) as the sole obstacle: "it is Poseidon, the girdler of the earth, that hath been wroth continually with quenchless anger for the Cyclops' sake whom he blinded of his eye."[^od1-poseidon]

Zeus then takes the initiative to bring Odysseus home: "let us here one and all take good counsel as touching his returning, that he may be got home; so shall Poseidon let go his displeasure, for he will in no wise be able to strive alone against all, in despite of all the deathless gods."[^od1-counsel]

[^od1-aegisthus]: "Lo you now, how vainly mortal men do blame the gods! For of us they say comes evil, whereas they even of themselves, through the blindness of their own hearts, have sorrows beyond that which is ordained. Even as of late Aegisthus, beyond that which was ordained, took to him the wedded wife of the son of Atreus, and killed her lord on his return, and that with sheer doom before his eyes, since we had warned him by the embassy of Hermes the keen-sighted, the slayer of Argos, that he should neither kill the man, nor woo his wife. For the son of Atreus shall be avenged at the hand of Orestes, so soon as he shall come to man's estate and long for his own country. So spake Hermes, yet he prevailed not on the heart of Aegisthus, for all his good will; but now hath he paid one price for all." (Odyssey I.758-769, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od1-poseidon]: "My child, what word hath escaped the door of thy lips? Yea, how should I forget divine Odysseus, who in understanding is beyond mortals and beyond all men hath done sacrifice to the deathless gods, who keep the wide heaven? Nay, but it is Poseidon, the girdler of the earth, that hath been wroth continually with quenchless anger for the Cyclops' sake whom he blinded of his eye, even godlike Polyphemus whose power is mightiest amongst all the Cyclôpes." (Odyssey I.788-794, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od1-counsel]: "let us here one and all take good counsel as touching his returning, that he may be got home; so shall Poseidon let go his displeasure, for he will in no wise be able to strive alone against all, in despite of all the deathless gods" (Odyssey I.799-802, trans. Butcher and Lang)

### Gods Among Men (Book XVII)

In Book XVII, a general theological statement is made about the gods' relationship to human affairs: "the gods, in the likeness of strangers from far countries, put on all manner of shapes, and wander through the cities, beholding the violence and the righteousness of men."[^od17-gods] This is spoken by a wooer rebuking Antinous for striking the disguised Odysseus — an irony, given that Zeus has indeed sent a god-favoured man among them.

### Omens of Thunder (Books XX-XXI)

Zeus provides direct signs to Odysseus in the final stages of his plan. When Odysseus prays for an omen, "Zeus, the counsellor, heard him. Straightway he thundered from shining Olympus, from on high from the place of clouds; and goodly Odysseus was glad."[^od20-thunder] A grinding-woman confirms the sign: "Father Zeus, who rulest over gods and men, loudly hast thou thundered from the starry sky, yet nowhere is there a cloud to be seen: this surely is a portent thou art showing to some mortal."[^od20-grinder]

Zeus thunders again at the pivotal moment when Odysseus strings the great bow: "Zeus thundered loud showing forth his tokens. And the steadfast goodly Odysseus was glad thereat, in that the son of deep-counselling Cronos had sent him a sign."[^od21-thunder] The double thunder — first in answer to prayer, then at the stringing of the bow — frames the slaying of the wooers as divinely sanctioned.

### The Final Divine Council (Book XXIV)

The [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) ends as it began — with a divine council. [Athena](athena.md) asks Zeus the question that will determine the poem's resolution: "O Father, our father Cronides, throned in the highest, answer and tell me what is now the hidden counsel of thy heart? Wilt thou yet further rouse up evil war and the terrible din of battle, or art thou minded to set them at one again in friendship?"[^od24-athena-question]

Zeus's response is the last major theological pronouncement of the poem. He reminds Athena that the vengeance was her own design, then decrees the terms of peace: "let them make a firm covenant together with sacrifice, and let him be king all his days, and let us bring about oblivion of the slaying of their children and their brethren; so may both sides love one another as of old, and let peace and wealth abundant be their portion."[^od24-decree] The decree of "oblivion" — a divinely imposed forgetting of bloodshed — is a striking theological concept: Zeus does not merely command peace but erases the memory that would prevent it.

He then seals the covenant with force: "the son of Cronos cast forth a flaming bolt, and it fell at the feet of the grey-eyed goddess, the daughter of the mighty Sire."[^od24-bolt] The bolt at [Athena](athena.md)'s feet is both signal and sanction — the final exercise of Zeus's supreme authority in the poem.

[^od17-gods]: "the gods, in the likeness of strangers from far countries, put on all manner of shapes, and wander through the cities, beholding the violence and the righteousness of men" (Odyssey XVII.9540-9543, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od20-thunder]: "Zeus, the counsellor, heard him. Straightway he thundered from shining Olympus, from on high from the place of clouds; and goodly Odysseus was glad" (Odyssey XX.10858-10860, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od20-grinder]: "Father Zeus, who rulest over gods and men, loudly hast thou thundered from the starry sky, yet nowhere is there a cloud to be seen: this surely is a portent thou art showing to some mortal." (Odyssey XX.10869-10871, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od21-thunder]: "Zeus thundered loud showing forth his tokens. And the steadfast goodly Odysseus was glad thereat, in that the son of deep-counselling Cronos had sent him a sign" (Odyssey XXI.11618-11620, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od24-athena-question]: "O Father, our father Cronides, throned in the highest, answer and tell me what is now the hidden counsel of thy heart? Wilt thou yet further rouse up evil war and the terrible din of battle, or art thou minded to set them at one again in friendship?" (Odyssey XXIV.13025-13029, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od24-decree]: "let them make a firm covenant together with sacrifice, and let him be king all his days, and let us bring about oblivion of the slaying of their children and their brethren; so may both sides love one another as of old, and let peace and wealth abundant be their portion" (Odyssey XXIV.13036-13040, trans. Butcher and Lang)
[^od24-bolt]: "the son of Cronos cast forth a flaming bolt, and it fell at the feet of the grey-eyed goddess, the daughter of the mighty Sire" (Odyssey XXIV.13105-13106, trans. Butcher and Lang)

## In the Iliad

### The Binding of Zeus (Book I)

Achilles tells his mother Thetis of a myth not found in any other source: that the Olympians once tried to bind Zeus. "Thou alone amid the immortals didst save the son of Kronos, lord of the storm-cloud, from shameful wreck, when all the other Olympians would have bound him, even [Hera](hera.md) and [Poseidon](poseidon.md) and Pallas [Athene](athena.md)." Thetis summoned Briareus (one of the [Hundred-Handers](../creatures/hundred-handers.md)): "so he sate him by Kronion's side rejoicing in his triumph, and the blessed gods feared him withal and bound not Zeus."[^il1-binding]

### The Nod of Zeus

When Thetis beseeches Zeus to honour Achilles, he consents with a nod whose power is absolute: "no word of mine is revocable nor false nor unfulfilled when the bowing of my head hath pledged it." Then: "Kronion spake, and bowed his dark brow, and the ambrosial locks waved from the king's immortal head; and he made great [Olympus](../places/olympus.md) quake."[^il1-nod]

### Zeus and Hera's Quarrel

[Hera](hera.md) immediately perceives Zeus's deal with Thetis and confronts him. Zeus responds with a threat: "Abide thou in silence and hearken to my bidding, lest all the gods that are in Olympus keep not off from thee my visitation, when I put forth my hands unapproachable against thee."[^il1-threat]

[^il1-binding]: "thou alone amid the immortals didst save the son of Kronos, lord of the storm-cloud, from shameful wreck, when all the other Olympians would have bound him, even Hera and Poseidon and Pallas Athene. Then didst thou, O goddess, enter in and loose him from his bonds, having with speed summoned to high Olympus him of the hundred arms whom gods call Briareus, but all men call Aigaion" (Iliad I.396-404, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il1-nod]: "Kronion spake, and bowed his dark brow, and the ambrosial locks waved from the king's immortal head; and he made great Olympus quake" (Iliad I.528-530)
[^il1-threat]: "Abide thou in silence and hearken to my bidding, lest all the gods that are in Olympus keep not off from thee my visitation, when I put forth my hands unapproachable against thee" (Iliad I.565-567)

### The Deceptive Dream (Book II)

Zeus sends a personified Dream to Agamemnon to deceive him: "Come now, thou baneful Dream, go to the Achaians' fleet ships, enter into the hut of Agamemnon son of Atreus, and tell him every word plainly as I charge thee. Bid him call to arms the flowing-haired Achaians with all speed, for that now he may take the wide-wayed city of the Trojans." The Dream takes the form of Nestor and delivers the false message. Agamemnon believed it — "fond man, in that he knew not the plans that Zeus had in mind."[^il2-dream]

Later, Agamemnon sacrifices to Zeus and prays for victory, "but not as yet would Kronion grant him fulfilment; he accepted the sacrifice, but made toil to wax increasingly."[^il2-sacrifice]

[^il2-dream]: "Come now, thou baneful Dream, go to the Achaians' fleet ships, enter into the hut of Agamemnon son of Atreus, and tell him every word plainly as I charge thee. Bid him call to arms the flowing-haired Achaians with all speed, for that now he may take the wide-wayed city of the Trojans" (Iliad II.793-800, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il2-sacrifice]: "not as yet would Kronion grant him fulfilment; he accepted the sacrifice, but made toil to wax increasingly" (Iliad II.1172-1173)

### The Golden Chain / Absolute Supremacy (Book VIII)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book VIII, Zeus summons all the gods and forbids any from aiding either side in battle. He backs this with the most explicit statement of his supremacy in the poem: "Fasten ye a rope of gold from heaven, and all ye gods lay hold thereof and all goddesses; yet could ye not drag from heaven to earth Zeus, counsellor supreme, not though ye toiled sore. But once I likewise were minded to draw with all my heart, then should I draw you up with very earth and sea withal. Thereafter would I bind the rope about a pinnacle of Olympus, and so should all those things be hung in air. By so much am I beyond gods and beyond men."[^il8-chain]

### The Golden Scales (Book VIII)

When the battle rages, Zeus weighs the fates: "when the sun bestrode mid-heaven, then did the Father balance his golden scales, and put therein two fates of death that layeth men at their length, one for horse-taming Trojans, one for mail-clad Achaians; and he took the scale-yard by the midst and lifted it, and the Achaians' day of destiny sank down."[^il8-scales] He then thundered from Ida and hurled lightning before Diomedes' horses.

### Pity and the Eagle (Book VIII)

After Agamemnon prays weeping, "the Father had pity on him as he wept, and vouchsafed him that his folk should be saved and perish not. Forthwith sent he an eagle—surest sign among winged fowl—holding in his claws a fawn."[^il8-eagle]

### Stopping Hera and Athena (Book VIII)

When [Hera](hera.md) and [Athena](athena.md) arm for battle and pass through heaven's gates, Zeus sends [Iris](iris.md) with terrible threats: "I will maim their fleet horses in the chariot, and them will I hurl out from the car, and will break in pieces the chariot; neither within the courses of ten years shall they heal them of the wounds the thunderbolt shall tear." He notes he is angrier at Athena than Hera: "with Hera have I not so great indignation... seeing it ever is her wont to thwart me, whate'er I have decreed."[^il8-threats]

When they return chastened, he taunts them: "all the gods that are in Olympus could not turn me... trembling erst gat hold upon your bright limbs ere that ye beheld war and war's fell deeds."[^il8-taunt]

### Prophecy (Book VIII)

Zeus reveals the future to Hera: "headlong Hector shall not refrain from battle till that Peleus' son fleet of foot have arisen beside the ships, that day when these shall fight amid the sterns in most grievous stress, around Patroklos fallen. Such is the doom of heaven." He then invokes the cosmic underworld: "not even though thou go to the nethermost bounds of earth and sea, where sit Iapetos and [Kronos](cronos.md) and have no joy in the beams of Hyperion the Sun-god, neither in any breeze, but deep [Tartaros](../places/tartarus.md) is round about them."[^il8-prophecy]

[^il8-chain]: "Fasten ye a rope of gold from heaven, and all ye gods lay hold thereof and all goddesses; yet could ye not drag from heaven to earth Zeus, counsellor supreme, not though ye toiled sore. But once I likewise were minded to draw with all my heart, then should I draw you up with very earth and sea withal. Thereafter would I bind the rope about a pinnacle of Olympus, and so should all those things be hung in air. By so much am I beyond gods and beyond men." (Iliad VIII.4429-4435, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il8-scales]: "when the sun bestrode mid-heaven, then did the Father balance his golden scales, and put therein two fates of death that layeth men at their length, one for horse-taming Trojans, one for mail-clad Achaians; and he took the scale-yard by the midst and lifted it, and the Achaians' day of destiny sank down" (Iliad VIII.4474-4481)
[^il8-eagle]: "the Father had pity on him as he wept, and vouchsafed him that his folk should be saved and perish not. Forthwith sent he an eagle—surest sign among winged fowl—holding in his claws a fawn" (Iliad VIII.4647-4650)
[^il8-threats]: "I will maim their fleet horses in the chariot, and them will I hurl out from the car, and will break in pieces the chariot; neither within the courses of ten years shall they heal them of the wounds the thunderbolt shall tear; that the bright-eyed one may know the end when she striveth against her father. But with Hera have I not so great indignation nor wrath: seeing it ever is her wont to thwart me, whate'er I have decreed" (Iliad VIII.4793-4799)
[^il8-taunt]: "all the gods that are in Olympus could not turn me: and for you twain, trembling erst gat hold upon your bright limbs ere that ye beheld war and war's fell deeds" (Iliad VIII.4840-4842)
[^il8-prophecy]: "headlong Hector shall not refrain from battle till that Peleus' son fleet of foot have arisen beside the ships, that day when these shall fight amid the sterns in most grievous stress, around Patroklos fallen. Such is the doom of heaven... not even though thou go to the nethermost bounds of earth and sea, where sit Iapetos and Kronos and have no joy in the beams of Hyperion the Sun-god, neither in any breeze, but deep Tartaros is round about them" (Iliad VIII.4861-4867)

### Sending Discord and Blood-Dew (Book XI)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book XI, Zeus opens the day's battle by sending a personified force: "Zeus sent forth fierce Discord unto the fleet ships of the Achaians, and in her hands she held the signal of war." Discord stood on Odysseus's ship and "cried shrilly in a great voice and terrible, and mighty strength she set in the heart of each of the Achaians, to war and fight unceasingly. And straightway to them war grew sweeter than to depart in the hollow ships."[^il11-discord]

Then Zeus sent an ominous sign: "the son of Kronos aroused an evil din, and from above rained down dew danked with blood out of the upper air, for that he was about to send many strong men down to Hades."[^il11-blood]

Later, Zeus descended to Ida "from heaven descending, with the thunderbolt in his hands," and sent Iris to Hector with precise tactical instructions: hold back while Agamemnon rages, then "I will give Hector strength to slay till he come even to the well-timbered ships, and the sun go down, and sacred darkness draw on."[^il11-iris]

During the main battle, Discord remained alone among the gods: "woful Discord was glad at the sight, for she alone of the gods was with them in the war; for the other gods were not beside them, but in peace they sat within their halls."[^il11-discord-glad]

[^il11-discord]: "Zeus sent forth fierce Discord unto the fleet ships of the Achaians, and in her hands she held the signal of war. And she stood upon the huge black ship of Odysseus, that was in the midst, to make her voice heard on either side... There stood the goddess and cried shrilly in a great voice and terrible, and mighty strength she set in the heart of each of the Achaians, to war and fight unceasingly. And straightway to them war grew sweeter than to depart in the hollow ships to their dear native land" (Iliad XI.6161-6171, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il11-blood]: "the son of Kronos aroused an evil din, and from above rained down dew danked with blood out of the upper air, for that he was about to send many strong men down to Hades" (Iliad XI.6204-6206)
[^il11-iris]: "So long as he sees Agamemnon, shepherd of the host, raging among the foremost fighters, and ruining the ranks of men, so long let him hold back, but bid the rest of the host war with the foe in strong battle. But when, or smitten with the spear or wounded with arrow shot, Agamemnon leapeth into his chariot, then will I give Hector strength to slay till he come even to the well-timbered ships, and the sun go down, and sacred darkness draw on" (Iliad XI.6333-6340)
[^il11-discord-glad]: "woful Discord was glad at the sight, for she alone of the gods was with them in the war; for the other gods were not beside them, but in peace they sat within their halls, where the goodly mansion of each was builded in the folds of Olympus" (Iliad XI.6223-6227)

### Zeus Wakes / Hanging Hera / Full Prophecy (Book XV)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book XV, Zeus wakes on Ida and discovers [Hera](hera.md)'s deception. He threatens her, recalling a previous punishment: "Dost thou not remember, when thou wert hung from on high, and from thy feet I suspended two anvils, and round thy hands fastened a golden bond that might not be broken? And thou didst hang in the clear air and the clouds, and the gods were wroth in high Olympus, but they could not come round and unloose thee." He also recalls the [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) incident: "Him didst thou drive, when thou hadst suborned the tempest... over the unvintaged deep... and then didst carry him away to well-peopled Kos."[^il15-hang]

Zeus then lays out the entire remaining course of the war: [Apollo](apollo.md) will revive Hector, drive the Greeks back; [Patroclus](../heroes/heracles.md) will be slain by Hector, who will also kill Zeus's own son Sarpedon; Achilles will slay Hector in revenge; then the Greeks will take Troy "through the counsels of [Athena](athena.md)." All this to fulfil his promise to [Thetis](thetis.md).[^il15-prophecy]

### The Three Lots (Book XV)

When [Iris](iris.md) orders [Poseidon](poseidon.md) to withdraw, Poseidon reveals the cosmic division of power: "Three brethren are we, and sons of [Kronos](cronos.md), whom [Rhea](rhea.md) bare, Zeus, and myself, and [Hades](hades.md) is the third, the ruler of the folk in the under-world. And in three lots are all things divided, and each drew a domain of his own, and to me fell the hoary sea, to be my habitation for ever, when we shook the lots: and Hades drew the murky darkness, and Zeus the wide heaven, in clear air and clouds, but the earth and high Olympus are yet common to all."[^il15-lots]

Despite this claim of equal status, Poseidon ultimately yields — but warns: "if against my will, and the will of Athene... and of Hera and [Hermes](hermes.md), and prince [Hephaistos](hephaestus.md), Zeus shall spare steep Ilios... let him know this, that our wrath will be inappeasable."[^il15-yield]

[^il15-hang]: "Dost thou not remember, when thou wert hung from on high, and from thy feet I suspended two anvils, and round thy hands fastened a golden bond that might not be broken? And thou didst hang in the clear air and the clouds, and the gods were wroth in high Olympus, but they could not come round and unloose thee" (Iliad XV.8730-8734, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il15-prophecy]: "let Phoebus Apollo spur Hector on to the war, and breathe strength into him again... him shall renowned Hector slay with the spear, in front of Ilios, after that he has slain many other youths, and among them my son, noble Sarpedon. In wrath therefor shall goodly Achilles slay Hector. From that hour verily will I cause a new pursuit from the ships... even until the Achaians take steep Ilios, through the counsels of Athene" (Iliad XV.8770-8785)
[^il15-lots]: "Three brethren are we, and sons of Kronos, whom Rhea bare, Zeus, and myself, and Hades is the third, the ruler of the folk in the under-world. And in three lots are all things divided, and each drew a domain of his own, and to me fell the hoary sea, to be my habitation for ever, when we shook the lots: and Hades drew the murky darkness, and Zeus the wide heaven, in clear air and clouds, but the earth and high Olympus are yet common to all" (Iliad XV.8891-8897)
[^il15-yield]: "if against my will, and the will of Athene, the driver of the prey, and of Hera and Hermes, and prince Hephaistos, Zeus shall spare steep Ilios, nor choose utterly to destroy it, and give great might to the Argives, let him know this, that our wrath will be inappeasable" (Iliad XV.8918-8921)

### Zeus's List of Loves (Book XIV)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book XIV, when [Hera](hera.md) appears before him on Ida wearing [Aphrodite](aphrodite.md)'s enchanted girdle, Zeus is overcome with desire and lists his past lovers — declaring none compares to his present longing: "Not when I loved the wife of Ixion, who bore Pirithoos, the peer of gods in counsel, nor when I loved Danae of the fair ankles, daughter of Akrisios, who bore [Perseus](../heroes/perseus.md), most renowned of all men, nor when I loved the famed daughter of Phoinix, who bore me Minos, and godlike Rhadamanthys, nay, nor even when I loved Semele, nor Alkmene in Thebes, and she bore [Herakles](../heroes/heracles.md), a child hardy of heart, but Semele bore [Dionysos](dionysus.md), a delight to mortals, nay, nor when I loved the fair-tressed queen, [Demeter](demeter.md), nor renowned Leto, nay, nor thy very self, as now I love thee, and sweet desire possesses me."[^il14-loves]

This list partially overlaps with the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md)'s catalogue of consorts, but adds several not mentioned there (Ixion's wife, Danae, the daughter of Phoinix) and uniquely adds Rhadamanthys as a son alongside Minos.

### Night's Power Over Zeus (Book XIV)

Sleep recalls that Zeus once "was wrathful, and dashed the gods about his mansion" and sought to destroy Sleep, but was stopped by the personified Night: "Night, that subdues both gods and men... he was in awe of doing aught displeasing to swift Night."[^il14-night] This is a remarkable passage — the only source in which Zeus acknowledges a power he will not challenge.

[^il14-loves]: "Not when I loved the wife of Ixion, who bore Pirithoos, the peer of gods in counsel, nor when I loved Danae of the fair ankles, daughter of Akrisios, who bore Perseus, most renowned of all men, nor when I loved the famed daughter of Phoinix, who bore me Minos, and godlike Rhadamanthys, nay, nor even when I loved Semele, nor Alkmene in Thebes, and she bore Herakles, a child hardy of heart, but Semele bore Dionysos, a delight to mortals, nay, nor when I loved the fair-tressed queen, Demeter, nor renowned Leto, nay, nor thy very self, as now I love thee, and sweet desire possesses me" (Iliad XIV.8510-8520, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il14-night]: "he was wrathful, and dashed the gods about his mansion, and me above all he sought, and he would have cast me from the upper air to perish in the deep, if Night had not saved me, Night, that subdues both gods and men. To her I came as a suppliant in my flight, and he ceased from pursuing, wrathful as he was, for he was in awe of doing aught displeasing to swift Night" (Iliad XIV.8449-8454)

### Sarpedon's Death and Bloody Raindrops (Book XVI)

When Sarpedon faces Patroklos, [Zeus](zeus.md) debates whether to save his son: "Ah woe is me for that it is fated that Sarpedon, the best-beloved of men to me, shall be subdued under Patroklos... And in two ways my heart within my breast is divided, as I ponder whether I should catch him up alive out of the tearful war, and set him down in the rich land of Lykia, or whether I should now subdue him beneath the hands of the son of Menoitios."[^il16-sarpedon]

[Hera](hera.md) opposes this, warning that other gods would want to save their sons too: "round the great citadel of Priam war many sons of the Immortals, and among the Immortals wilt thou send terrible wrath."[^il16-hera-warns] Zeus yields, but honours Sarpedon with a portent: "he shed bloody raindrops on the earth, honouring his dear son, that Patroklos was about to slay in the deep-soiled land of Troia, far off from his own country."[^il16-raindrops]

After Sarpedon's death, Zeus commands [Apollo](apollo.md) to bear the body home: "go take Sarpedon out of range of darts, and cleanse the black blood from him, and thereafter bear him far away, and bathe him in the streams of the river, and anoint him with ambrosia, and clothe him in garments that wax not old, and send him to be wafted by fleet convoy, by the twin brethren Sleep and Death."[^il16-sleep-death]

[^il16-sarpedon]: "Ah woe is me for that it is fated that Sarpedon, the best-beloved of men to me, shall be subdued under Patroklos son of Menoitios. And in two ways my heart within my breast is divided, as I ponder whether I should catch him up alive out of the tearful war, and set him down in the rich land of Lykia, or whether I should now subdue him beneath the hands of the son of Menoitios" (Iliad XVI.9682-9687, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il16-hera-warns]: "A mortal man long doomed to fate dost thou desire to deliver again from death of evil name? Work thy will, but all we other gods will in no wise praise thee... if thou dost send Sarpedon living to his own house, consider lest thereon some other god likewise desire to send his own dear son away out of the strong battle. For round the great citadel of Priam war many sons of the Immortals, and among the Immortals wilt thou send terrible wrath" (Iliad XVI.9690-9697)
[^il16-raindrops]: "he shed bloody raindrops on the earth, honouring his dear son, that Patroklos was about to slay in the deep-soiled land of Troia, far off from his own country" (Iliad XVI.9706-9708)
[^il16-sleep-death]: "Prithee, dear Phoebus, go take Sarpedon out of range of darts, and cleanse the black blood from him, and thereafter bear him far away, and bathe him in the streams of the river, and anoint him with ambrosia, and clothe him in garments that wax not old, and send him to be wafted by fleet convoy, by the twin brethren Sleep and Death, that quickly will set him in the rich land of wide Lykia" (Iliad XVI.9830-9837)

### Zeus Pities Hector / The Mortal Condition (Book XVII)

When Hector dons Achilles' divine armour, Zeus pities him: "Ah, hapless man, no thought is in thy heart of death that yet draweth nigh unto thee; thou doest on thee the divine armour of a peerless man before whom the rest have terror." He grants Hector strength, but prophesies: "nowise shalt thou come home out of the battle, for Andromache to receive from thee Peleides' glorious arms."[^il17-hector-armour]

Zeus also pities the immortal horses of Achilles as they weep for Patroklos: "Ah, hapless pair, why gave we you to king Peleus, a mortal man, while ye are deathless and ever young? Was it that ye should suffer sorrows among ill-fated men? For methinketh there is nothing more piteous than a man among all things that breathe and creep upon the earth."[^il17-horses]

[^il17-hector-armour]: "Ah, hapless man, no thought is in thy heart of death that yet draweth nigh unto thee; thou doest on thee the divine armour of a peerless man before whom the rest have terror. His comrade, gentle and brave, thou hast slain, and unmeetly hast stripped the armour from his head and shoulders; yet now for a while at least I will give into thy hands great might, in recompense for this, even that nowise shalt thou come home out of the battle, for Andromache to receive from thee Peleides' glorious arms" (Iliad XVII.10109-10116, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il17-horses]: "Ah, hapless pair, why gave we you to king Peleus, a mortal man, while ye are deathless and ever young? Was it that ye should suffer sorrows among ill-fated men? For methinketh there is nothing more piteous than a man among all things that breathe and creep upon the earth" (Iliad XVII.10276-10280)

## In the Bibliotheca (1.6.1-1.6.3)

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) adds substantial new detail to Zeus's role in the [Gigantomachy](../creatures/giants.md) and the [Typhon](../creatures/typhoeus.md) battle.

### The Gigantomachy

When [Gaia](gaia.md) sought an herb to protect the [Giants](../creatures/giants.md) from mortals, Zeus "forbade the Dawn and the Moon and the Sun to shine, and then, before anybody else could get it, he culled the simple himself."[^apd-zeus-herb] He smote Porphyrion with a [thunderbolt](../objects/thunderbolt.md) after inspiring him with lust for [Hera](hera.md), and "the other giants Zeus smote and destroyed with thunderbolts."[^apd-zeus-giants]

### The Battle with Typhon

Zeus attacked [Typhoeus](../creatures/typhoeus.md) with thunderbolts at a distance, then struck with "an adamantine sickle" at close range. But at Mount Casius, Typhon "twined about him and gripped him in his coils, and wresting the sickle from him severed the sinews of his hands and feet" and imprisoned him in the Corycian cave.[^apd-zeus-sinews]

> **NEW DETAIL:** Zeus's temporary defeat — sinews severed, imprisoned in a cave — is entirely absent from the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md), where Zeus wins decisively.

[Hermes](hermes.md) and Aegipan stole the sinews and restored them. Zeus then pursued Typhon in "a chariot of winged horses" until finally casting Mount Etna upon him in Sicily.[^apd-zeus-etna]

[^apd-zeus-herb]: "Zeus forbade the Dawn and the Moon and the Sun to shine, and then, before anybody else could get it, he culled the simple himself, and by means of Athena summoned Hercules to his help." (Bibliotheca 1.6.1, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-zeus-giants]: "The other giants Zeus smote and destroyed with thunderbolts and all of them Hercules shot with arrows as they were dying." (Bibliotheca 1.6.2, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-zeus-sinews]: "Typhon twined about him and gripped him in his coils, and wresting the sickle from him severed the sinews of his hands and feet, and lifting him on his shoulders carried him through the sea to Cilicia and deposited him on arrival in the Corycian cave." (Bibliotheca 1.6.3, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-zeus-etna]: "when he started to flee through the Sicilian sea, Zeus cast Mount Etna in Sicily upon him." (Bibliotheca 1.6.3, trans. Frazer)

## In the Bibliotheca (Book 2)

### Seductions and Offspring

Niobe, daughter of Phoroneus, "was the first mortal woman with whom Zeus cohabited," bearing him a son Argus.[^apd-zeus-niobe]

Zeus seduced [Io](../heroes/io.md) "while she held the priesthood of [Hera](hera.md), but being detected by Hera he by a touch turned Io into a white cow and swore that he had not known her; wherefore Hesiod remarks that lover's oaths do not draw down the anger of the gods."[^apd-zeus-io] When Hera set Argus the All-seeing to guard the cow, "Zeus ordered [Hermes](hermes.md) to steal the cow." When Hera later had Io's son Epaphus spirited away by the Curetes, "Zeus learned of it" and "slew the Curetes."[^apd-zeus-curetes]

Zeus fathered [Perseus](../heroes/perseus.md) on [Danae](../heroes/danae.md): "some say that Zeus had intercourse with her in the shape of a stream of gold which poured through the roof into Danae's lap."[^apd-zeus-danae]

### Heracles' Birth

Zeus declared "that the descendant of Perseus then about to be born would reign over Mycenae," but [Hera](hera.md) exploited this oath by hastening Eurystheus's birth and delaying [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md)' delivery.[^apd-zeus-oath] Later, "Zeus came by night and prolonging the one night threefold he assumed the likeness of Amphitryon and bedded with Alcmena."[^apd-zeus-alcmena]

### Other Interventions

When the Teumessian vixen (fated to be uncatchable) was pursued by Cephalus's hound (fated to catch whatever it pursued), "Zeus turned both of them into stone" — resolving the paradox.[^apd-zeus-stone]

When [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) and [Apollo](apollo.md) fought over the Delphic tripod, "Zeus threw a thunderbolt between them" to separate them.[^apd-zeus-tripod]

After Hera sent storms against Heracles as he sailed from [Troy](../places/troy.md), Zeus punished her: "Hera sent grievous storms, which so vexed Zeus that he hung her from Olympus."[^apd-zeus-hung-hera]

[^apd-zeus-niobe]: "Niobe had by Zeus (and she was the first mortal woman with whom Zeus cohabited) a son Argus" (Bibliotheca 2.1.1, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-zeus-io]: "Zeus seduced her while she held the priesthood of Hera, but being detected by Hera he by a touch turned Io into a white cow and swore that he had not known her; wherefore Hesiod remarks that lover's oaths do not draw down the anger of the gods" (Bibliotheca 2.1.3)
[^apd-zeus-curetes]: "Him Hera besought the Curetes to make away with, and make away with him they did. When Zeus learned of it, he slew the Curetes" (Bibliotheca 2.1.3)
[^apd-zeus-danae]: "some say that Zeus had intercourse with her in the shape of a stream of gold which poured through the roof into Danae's lap" (Bibliotheca 2.4.1)
[^apd-zeus-oath]: "Zeus declared among the gods that the descendant of Perseus then about to be born would reign over Mycenae, and Hera out of jealousy persuaded the Ilithyias to retard Alcmena's delivery, and contrived that Eurystheus, son of Sthenelus, should be born a seven-month child" (Bibliotheca 2.4.5)
[^apd-zeus-alcmena]: "before Amphitryon reached Thebes, Zeus came by night and prolonging the one night threefold he assumed the likeness of Amphitryon and bedded with Alcmena and related what had happened concerning the Teleboans" (Bibliotheca 2.4.8)
[^apd-zeus-stone]: "when the vixen was chased by the dog, Zeus turned both of them into stone" (Bibliotheca 2.4.7)
[^apd-zeus-tripod]: "Apollo fought him, and Zeus threw a thunderbolt between them" (Bibliotheca 2.6.2)
[^apd-zeus-hung-hera]: "When Hercules was sailing from Troy, Hera sent grievous storms, which so vexed Zeus that he hung her from Olympus" (Bibliotheca 2.7.1)
