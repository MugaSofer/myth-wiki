## Overview

**Zeus** is the king of the gods, ruling from [Olympus](../places/olympus.md). In the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md), he is referred to frequently by his epithets before his birth narrative, reflecting his ultimate supremacy among the gods.

## Epithets & Description

Zeus accumulates more epithets than any other figure across the sources:

- **"the aegis-holder"** / **"who holds the aegis"** — the most frequent (Theogony 11, 13, 25, and throughout)
- **"the loud-thunderer"** / **"who delights in thunder"** — (Theogony 41; Hymn III 2; Hymn XII 4)
- **"the almighty son of Cronos"** — (Theogony 4)
- **"far-seeing Zeus"** / **"far-seeing Olympian Zeus"** — used in council and judgment (Theogony 457, 884; [Works and Days](../sources/theogony.md) 169c, 267)
- **"the dark-clouded Son of Cronos"** / **"Zeus who drives the clouds"** — (Hymn to Demeter 316, 321; Theogony 558)
- **"father of men and gods"** — used at moments of supreme authority (Theogony 457, 542, 838, 897)

In the Hymn to Hermes, when his infant son denies stealing cattle, "Zeus laughed out loud" — one of the few physical responses described.[^desc-laugh]

[^desc-laugh]: "Zeus laughed out loud to see his evil-plotting child well and cunningly denying guilt about the cattle" (Homeric Hymn IV to Hermes 389-390, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Domains & Powers

Zeus holds "the lightning and glowing thunderbolt," having "overcome by might his father [Cronos](cronos.md)," after which "he distributed fairly to the immortals their portions and declared their privileges."[^theog-rule] The thunderbolt was given to him by the [Cyclopes](../creatures/cyclopes.md).[^theog-cyclopes]

It is "through the [Muses](muses.md) and far-shooting [Apollo](apollo.md) that there are singers and harpers upon the earth; but princes are of Zeus."[^theog-princes]

[^theog-rule]: "he was reigning in heaven, himself holding the lightning and glowing thunderbolt, when he had overcome by might his father Cronos; and he distributed fairly to the immortals their portions and declared their privileges" (Theogony 71-74, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^theog-cyclopes]: "who gave Zeus the thunder and made the thunderbolt" (Theogony 141)
[^theog-princes]: "For it is through the Muses and far-shooting Apollo that there are singers and harpers upon the earth; but princes are of Zeus" (Theogony 94-96)

## Birth

[Cronos](cronos.md) swallowed each of his children as they were born, having learned from [Gaia](gaia.md) and [Uranus](uranus.md) "that he was destined to be overcome by his own son."[^theog-prophecy] When [Rhea](rhea.md) was about to bear Zeus, she conspired with her parents. She was sent to Lyctus in Crete, where Gaia "took him in her arms and hid him in a remote cave beneath the secret places of the holy earth on thick-wooded Mount Aegeum."[^theog-cave] Cronos was given a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes instead.[^theog-stone]

Zeus was "the youngest of her children" — his siblings, swallowed before him, were [Hestia](hestia.md), [Demeter](demeter.md), [Hera](hera.md) ("gold-shod"), [Hades](hades.md) ("strong... pitiless in heart, who dwells under the earth"), and [Poseidon](poseidon.md) ("the loud-crashing Earth-Shaker").[^theog-siblings]

[^theog-prophecy]: "he learned from Earth and starry Heaven that he was destined to be overcome by his own son, strong though he was, through the contriving of great Zeus" (Theogony 463-464)
[^theog-cave]: "Thither came Earth carrying him swiftly through the black night to Lyctus first, and took him in her arms and hid him in a remote cave beneath the secret places of the holy earth on thick-wooded Mount Aegeum" (Theogony 477-480)
[^theog-stone]: "to the mightily ruling son of Heaven, the earlier king of the gods, she gave a great stone wrapped in swaddling clothes. Then he took it in his hands and thrust it down into his belly: wretch! he knew not in his heart that in place of the stone his son was left behind" (Theogony 481-485)
[^theog-siblings]: "Rhea was subject in love to Cronos and bare splendid children, Hestia, Demeter, and gold-shod Hera and strong Hades, pitiless in heart, who dwells under the earth, and the loud-crashing Earth-Shaker, and wise Zeus, father of gods and men, by whose thunder the wide earth is shaken" (Theogony 453-458)

## Genealogy

### Consorts and Children (Theogony 886-944)

Zeus's consorts are listed in order in the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md):[^theog-consorts]

1. **Metis** — "wisest among gods and mortal men." When she was about to bear [Athena](athena.md), Zeus "craftily deceived her with cunning words and put her in his own belly, as [Earth](gaia.md) and starry [Heaven](uranus.md) advised," because "very wise children were destined to be born of her" including a son who would be "king of gods and men."[^theog-metis]
2. **[Themis](themis.md)** — bore the Horae (Hours): Eunomia (Order), Dike (Justice), and Eirene (Peace); and the Moerae (Fates): Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos.[^theog-themis]
3. **Eurynome** (daughter of [Oceanus](oceanus.md)) — bore the three Charites (Graces): Aglaea, Euphrosyne, and Thaleia.[^theog-graces]
4. **[Demeter](demeter.md)** — bore "white-armed [Persephone](persephone.md) whom Aidoneus [[Hades](hades.md)] carried off from her mother; but wise Zeus gave her to him."[^theog-demeter]
5. **[Mnemosyne](mnemosyne.md)** — bore "the nine gold-crowned [Muses](muses.md) who delight in feasts and the pleasures of song."[^theog-muses]
6. **Leto** — bore "[Apollo](apollo.md) and [Artemis](artemis.md) delighting in arrows, children lovely above all the sons of Heaven."[^theog-leto]
7. **[Hera](hera.md)** (final wife) — "brought forth Hebe and [Ares](ares.md) and Eileithyia."[^theog-hera]

[^theog-consorts]: "Now Zeus, king of the gods, made Metis his wife first, and she was wisest among gods and mortal men" (Theogony 886-923)
[^theog-metis]: "Zeus craftily deceived her with cunning words and put her in his own belly, as Earth and starry Heaven advised. For they advised him so, to the end that no other should hold royal sway over the eternal gods in place of Zeus; for very wise children were destined to be born of her" (Theogony 886-900)
[^theog-themis]: "Next he married bright Themis who bare the Horae (Hours), and Eunomia (Order), Dike (Justice), and blooming Eirene (Peace), who mind the works of mortal men, and the Moerae (Fates) to whom wise Zeus gave the greatest honour, Clotho, and Lachesis, and Atropos who give mortal men evil and good to have" (Theogony 901-906)
[^theog-graces]: "Eurynome, the daughter of Ocean, beautiful in form, bare him three fair-cheeked Charites (Graces), Aglaea, and Euphrosyne, and lovely Thaleia, from whose eyes as they glanced flowed love that unnerves the limbs" (Theogony 907-911)
[^theog-demeter]: "Also he came to the bed of all-nourishing Demeter, and she bare white-armed Persephone whom Aidoneus carried off from her mother; but wise Zeus gave her to him" (Theogony 912-914)
[^theog-muses]: "he loved Mnemosyne with the beautiful hair: and of her the nine gold-crowned Muses were born who delight in feasts and the pleasures of song" (Theogony 915-917)
[^theog-leto]: "Leto was joined in love with Zeus who holds the aegis, and bare Apollo and Artemis delighting in arrows, children lovely above all the sons of Heaven" (Theogony 918-920)
[^theog-hera]: "Lastly, he made Hera his blooming wife: and she was joined in love with the king of gods and men, and brought forth Hebe and Ares and Eileithyia" (Theogony 921-923)

### Birth of Athena

"Zeus himself gave birth from his own head to bright-eyed Tritogeneia, the awful, the strife-stirring, the host-leader, the unwearying, the queen, who delights in tumults and wars and battles."[^theog-athena]

[^theog-athena]: "Zeus himself gave birth from his own head to bright-eyed Tritogeneia, the awful, the strife-stirring, the host-leader, the unwearying, the queen, who delights in tumults and wars and battles" (Theogony 924-926)

### Other Children

- With **Maia** (daughter of Atlas): "[Hermes](hermes.md), the herald of the deathless gods"[^theog-hermes]
- With **Semele** (daughter of Cadmus): "joyous [Dionysus](dionysus.md),—a mortal woman an immortal son. And now they both are gods."[^theog-dion]
- With **Alcmena**: "mighty [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md)"[^theog-heracles]

[^theog-hermes]: "Maia, the daughter of Atlas, bare to Zeus glorious Hermes, the herald of the deathless gods, for she went up into his holy bed" (Theogony 938-939)
[^theog-dion]: "Semele, daughter of Cadmus was joined with him in love and bare him a splendid son, joyous Dionysus,—a mortal woman an immortal son. And now they both are gods" (Theogony 940-942)
[^theog-heracles]: "Alcmena was joined in love with Zeus who drives the clouds and bare mighty Heracles" (Theogony 943-944)

## Mythology

### Rise to Power

After the deception, Cronos's son was "left behind, unconquered and untroubled, and... he was soon to overcome him by force and might and drive him from his honours, himself to reign over the deathless gods."[^theog-rise]

Before the battle with the [Titans](titans.md), Zeus called "all the deathless gods to great [Olympus](../places/olympus.md), and said that whosoever of the gods would fight with him against the Titans, he would not cast him out from his rights." Styx was the first to answer, bringing her children (Zelus, Nike, Cratos, Bia), and was rewarded by being made "the great oath of the gods."[^theog-styx]

[^theog-rise]: "his son was left behind, unconquered and untroubled, and that he was soon to overcome him by force and might and drive him from his honours, himself to reign over the deathless gods" (Theogony 485-491)
[^theog-styx]: "whosoever of the gods would fight with him against the Titans, he would not cast him out from his rights, but each should have the office which he had before amongst the deathless gods... So deathless Styx came first to Olympus with her children through the wit of her dear father. And Zeus honoured her, and gave her very great gifts, for her he appointed to be the great oath of the gods" (Theogony 389-401)

### Freeing His Siblings

Cronos "was beguiled by the deep suggestions of [Earth](gaia.md), and brought up again his offspring, vanquished by the arts and might of his own son, and he vomited up first the stone which he had swallowed last." Zeus set the stone "in the wide-pathed earth at goodly Pytho under the glens of Parnassus, to be a sign thenceforth and a marvel to mortal men."[^theog-stone2] He also freed the [Cyclopes](../creatures/cyclopes.md), who in gratitude "gave him thunder and the glowing thunderbolt and lightening: for before that, huge Earth had hidden these."[^theog-thunder]

[^theog-stone2]: "great Cronos the wily was beguiled by the deep suggestions of Earth, and brought up again his offspring, vanquished by the arts and might of his own son, and he vomited up first the stone which he had swallowed last. And Zeus set it fast in the wide-pathed earth at goodly Pytho under the glens of Parnassus, to be a sign thenceforth and a marvel to mortal men" (Theogony 492-497)
[^theog-thunder]: "they remembered to be grateful to him for his kindness, and gave him thunder and the glowing thunderbolt and lightening: for before that, huge Earth had hidden these. In them he trusts and rules over mortals and immortals" (Theogony 501-506)

### The Titanomachy

See [Titanomachy](../events/titanomachy.md). Zeus led the Olympian gods against the [Titans](titans.md) in a ten-year war, winning with the help of the [Hundred-Handers](../creatures/hundred-handers.md) and his thunderbolt.[^theog-titan]

[^theog-titan]: "the Titan gods and as many as sprang from Cronos had long been fighting together in stubborn war with heart-grieving toil... Then Zeus no longer held back his might; but straight his heart was filled with fury and he showed forth all his strength" (Theogony 617-735)

### Defeat of Typhoeus

After the [Titanomachy](../events/titanomachy.md), [Gaia](gaia.md) bore [Typhoeus](../creatures/typhoeus.md), who nearly overthrew Zeus's rule. Zeus defeated him with thunder and lightning and cast him into [Tartarus](../places/tartarus.md).[^theog-typhoeus]

[^theog-typhoeus]: "when Zeus had driven the Titans from heaven, huge Earth bare her youngest child Typhoeus of the love of Tartarus... So when Zeus had raised up his might and seized his arms, thunder and lightning and lurid thunderbolt, he leaped from Olympus and struck him" (Theogony 820-868)

### Establishing His Rule

"When the blessed gods had finished their toil, and settled by force their struggle for honours with the Titans, they pressed far-seeing Olympian Zeus to reign and to rule over them, by Earth's prompting. So he divided their dignities amongst them."[^theog-divide]

[^theog-divide]: "when the blessed gods had finished their toil, and settled by force their struggle for honours with the Titans, they pressed far-seeing Olympian Zeus to reign and to rule over them, by Earth's prompting. So he divided their dignities amongst them" (Theogony 881-885)

## In the Iliad

### The Binding of Zeus (Book I)

Achilles tells his mother Thetis of a myth not found in any other source: that the Olympians once tried to bind Zeus. "Thou alone amid the immortals didst save the son of Kronos, lord of the storm-cloud, from shameful wreck, when all the other Olympians would have bound him, even [Hera](hera.md) and [Poseidon](poseidon.md) and Pallas [Athene](athena.md)." Thetis summoned Briareus (one of the [Hundred-Handers](../creatures/hundred-handers.md)): "so he sate him by Kronion's side rejoicing in his triumph, and the blessed gods feared him withal and bound not Zeus."[^il1-binding]

### The Nod of Zeus

When Thetis beseeches Zeus to honour Achilles, he consents with a nod whose power is absolute: "no word of mine is revocable nor false nor unfulfilled when the bowing of my head hath pledged it." Then: "Kronion spake, and bowed his dark brow, and the ambrosial locks waved from the king's immortal head; and he made great [Olympus](../places/olympus.md) quake."[^il1-nod]

### Zeus and Hera's Quarrel

[Hera](hera.md) immediately perceives Zeus's deal with Thetis and confronts him. Zeus responds with a threat: "Abide thou in silence and hearken to my bidding, lest all the gods that are in Olympus keep not off from thee my visitation, when I put forth my hands unapproachable against thee."[^il1-threat]

[^il1-binding]: "thou alone amid the immortals didst save the son of Kronos, lord of the storm-cloud, from shameful wreck, when all the other Olympians would have bound him, even Hera and Poseidon and Pallas Athene. Then didst thou, O goddess, enter in and loose him from his bonds, having with speed summoned to high Olympus him of the hundred arms whom gods call Briareus, but all men call Aigaion" (Iliad I.396-404, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il1-nod]: "Kronion spake, and bowed his dark brow, and the ambrosial locks waved from the king's immortal head; and he made great Olympus quake" (Iliad I.528-530)
[^il1-threat]: "Abide thou in silence and hearken to my bidding, lest all the gods that are in Olympus keep not off from thee my visitation, when I put forth my hands unapproachable against thee" (Iliad I.565-567)

### The Deceptive Dream (Book II)

Zeus sends a personified Dream to Agamemnon to deceive him: "Come now, thou baneful Dream, go to the Achaians' fleet ships, enter into the hut of Agamemnon son of Atreus, and tell him every word plainly as I charge thee. Bid him call to arms the flowing-haired Achaians with all speed, for that now he may take the wide-wayed city of the Trojans." The Dream takes the form of Nestor and delivers the false message. Agamemnon believed it — "fond man, in that he knew not the plans that Zeus had in mind."[^il2-dream]

Later, Agamemnon sacrifices to Zeus and prays for victory, "but not as yet would Kronion grant him fulfilment; he accepted the sacrifice, but made toil to wax increasingly."[^il2-sacrifice]

[^il2-dream]: "Come now, thou baneful Dream, go to the Achaians' fleet ships, enter into the hut of Agamemnon son of Atreus, and tell him every word plainly as I charge thee. Bid him call to arms the flowing-haired Achaians with all speed, for that now he may take the wide-wayed city of the Trojans" (Iliad II.793-800, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il2-sacrifice]: "not as yet would Kronion grant him fulfilment; he accepted the sacrifice, but made toil to wax increasingly" (Iliad II.1172-1173)
