[^theog-birth]: "Leto was joined in love with Zeus who holds the aegis, and bare Apollo and Artemis delighting in arrows, children lovely above all the sons of Heaven" (Theogony 918-920, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## The Huntress (Hymn XXVII)

[Homeric Hymn XXVII](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) gives a vivid description of Artemis in action: "Over the shadowy hills and windy peaks she draws her golden bow, rejoicing in the chase, and sends out grievous shafts. The tops of the high mountains tremble and the tangled wood echoes awesomely with the outcry of beasts."[^hh27-hunt]

After hunting, she goes to [Apollo](apollo.md)'s house at Delphi: "There she hangs up her curved bow and her arrows, and heads and leads the dances, gracefully arrayed, while all they utter their heavenly voice, singing how neat-ankled Leto bare children supreme among the immortals."[^hh27-delphi]

[^hh27-hunt]: "Over the shadowy hills and windy peaks she draws her golden bow, rejoicing in the chase, and sends out grievous shafts. The tops of the high mountains tremble and the tangled wood echoes awesomely with the outcry of beasts: earthquakes and the sea also where fishes shoal" (Homeric Hymn XXVII to Artemis 4-10, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^hh27-delphi]: "this huntress who delights in arrows slackens her supple bow and goes to the great house of her dear brother Phoebus Apollo, to the rich land of Delphi, there to order the lovely dance of the Muses and Graces. There she hangs up her curved bow and her arrows, and heads and leads the dances" (Homeric Hymn XXVII to Artemis 12-18)

## In the Iliad

### Slayer of Mortals (Book VI)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book VI, Artemis is named twice as the slayer of mortal women:

In Glaukos's account of Bellerophon, after Bellerophon's line was cursed: "his daughter was slain in wrath of gold-gleaming Artemis."[^il6-bellerophon] (The translation notes this may also be read as "Artemis of the golden reins.")

In Andromache's lament, she tells how Achilles destroyed her family but spared her mother for ransom: "but in her father's halls was she smitten by the Archer Artemis."[^il6-andromache]

Both passages show Artemis as a bringer of death to women, striking suddenly and without elaboration.

[^il6-bellerophon]: "his daughter was slain in wrath of gold-gleaming Artemis" (Iliad VI.3641-3642, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il6-andromache]: "in her father's halls was she smitten by the Archer Artemis" (Iliad VI.3859)
