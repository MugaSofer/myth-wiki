She is **"tall to look upon and enviable in mien"** — a rare physical description, from the Olympus scene in Hymn III (199).[^desc-tall]

In Hymn IX she drives an **"all-golden chariot"** through Smyrna to Claros.[^desc-chariot]

In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md), when Actaeon stumbles upon her bathing, her nymphs cluster around to shield her but "she stood head and shoulders taller than her guards.—as clouds bright-tinted by the slanting sun, or purple-dyed Aurora, so appeared Diana's countenance when she was seen."[^met-art-height]

In Hymn XXVII she is described as an active figure in the landscape: "Over the shadowy hills and windy peaks she draws her [golden bow](../objects/artemis-bow.md), rejoicing in the chase."[^desc-chase] After the hunt, she "hangs up her curved bow and her arrows, and heads and leads the dances, gracefully arrayed."[^desc-dance]

## Powers

- **Painless death for women:** As [Apollo](apollo.md)'s arrows bring death to men, Artemis's bring death to women. She slew Orion "with the visitation of her gentle shafts."[^od5-orion] Her [bow](../objects/artemis-bow.md) brings "the painless death of women" ([Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) XI).[^bow-painless]
- **Cosmic impact:** Her hunting shakes the earth itself: "The tops of the high mountains tremble and the tangled wood echoes awesomely with the outcry of beasts: earthquakes and the sea also where fishes shoal."[^hh27-hunt]
- **Transformation:** She turned Actaeon into a stag — "Diana made horns grow on his head, and he was devoured by his own dogs."[^hyg-180-punishment] In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md), she transforms Callisto into a bear.[^met-art-callisto]
- **Slayer of women:** [Hera](hera.md) characterises Artemis's role: "against women [Zeus](zeus.md) made thee a lion, and giveth thee to slay whomso of them thou wilt" ([Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) XXI.12176-12177).[^il21-lion]
- **Substitution and transport:** At Aulis, she "cast mist about" Iphigenia, "substituted a deer in her place," and "bore Iphigenia through the clouds to the Tauric land."[^hyg-98-substitution][^hyg-98-priestess]

[^il21-lion]: "against women Zeus made thee a lion, and giveth thee to slay whomso of them thou wilt" (Iliad XXI.12176-12177)
[^bow-painless]: See [Artemis's Bow](../objects/artemis-bow.md) for full citations.

## Birth

"Leto was joined in love with [Zeus](zeus.md) who holds the aegis, and bare [Apollo](apollo.md) and Artemis delighting in arrows, children lovely above all the sons of Heaven."[^theog-birth]

[^theog-birth]: "Leto was joined in love with Zeus who holds the aegis, and bare Apollo and Artemis delighting in arrows, children lovely above all the sons of Heaven" (Theogony 918-920, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## The Huntress (Hymn XXVII)

[Homeric Hymn XXVII](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) gives a vivid description of Artemis in action: "Over the shadowy hills and windy peaks she draws her golden bow, rejoicing in the chase, and sends out grievous shafts. The tops of the high mountains tremble and the tangled wood echoes awesomely with the outcry of beasts."[^hh27-hunt]

After hunting, she goes to [Apollo](apollo.md)'s house at Delphi: "There she hangs up her curved bow and her arrows, and heads and leads the dances, gracefully arrayed, while all they utter their heavenly voice, singing how neat-ankled Leto bare children supreme among the immortals."[^hh27-delphi]

[^hh27-hunt]: "Over the shadowy hills and windy peaks she draws her golden bow, rejoicing in the chase, and sends out grievous shafts. The tops of the high mountains tremble and the tangled wood echoes awesomely with the outcry of beasts: earthquakes and the sea also where fishes shoal" (Homeric Hymn XXVII to Artemis 4-10, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)
[^hh27-delphi]: "this huntress who delights in arrows slackens her supple bow and goes to the great house of her dear brother Phoebus Apollo, to the rich land of Delphi, there to order the lovely dance of the Muses and Graces. There she hangs up her curved bow and her arrows, and heads and leads the dances" (Homeric Hymn XXVII to Artemis 12-18)

## Immune to Aphrodite (Hymn V)

In the [Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) (V), Artemis is named as one of three goddesses immune to [Aphrodite](aphrodite.md)'s power: "Nor does laughter-loving Aphrodite ever tame in love Artemis, the huntress with shafts of gold; for she loves archery and the slaying of wild beasts in the mountains."[^hh5-immune]

[^hh5-immune]: "Nor does laughter-loving Aphrodite ever tame in love Artemis, the huntress with shafts of gold; for she loves archery and the slaying of wild beasts in the mountains" (Homeric Hymn V to Aphrodite 16-20, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## In the Fabulae

### Iphigenia Substituted (§98)

The [Fabulae](../sources/hyginus.md) tells the story of Artemis's (Diana's) intervention at Aulis. Agamemnon had "wounded a deer of hers in hunting, and had spoken rather haughtily against Diana."[^hyg-98-offense] Her response: "a storm kept them at Aulis because of the anger of Diana."[^hyg-98-storm]

The oracle demanded sacrifice: "When he had called together the soothsayers, and Calchas had declared that he could expiate in no other way than by sacrificing his daughter, Iphigenia, Agamemnon at first refused."[^hyg-98-calchas] Odysseus convinced him: "Then Ulysses by his advice won him over to a fine scheme. The same Ulysses along with Diomede was sent to get Iphigenia, and when he came to Clytemnestra her mother, he falsely said she was to be given in marriage to Achilles."[^hyg-98-ulysses]

At the moment of sacrifice, Artemis intervened: "When she was brought to Aulis, and her father was about to sacrifice her, Diana pitied the girl, cast mist about her, and substituted a deer in her place."[^hyg-98-substitution] The transport was divine: "She bore Iphigenia through the clouds to the Tauric land, and there made her a priestess of her temple."[^hyg-98-priestess]

[^hyg-98-offense]: "Agamemnon had wounded a deer of hers in hunting, and had spoken rather haughtily against Diana." (Fabulae §98, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-98-storm]: "a storm kept them at Aulis because of the anger of Diana." (Fabulae §98, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-98-calchas]: "When he had called together the soothsayers, and Calchas had declared that he could expiate in no other way than by sacrificing his daughter, Iphigenia, Agamemnon at first refused." (Fabulae §98, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-98-ulysses]: "Then Ulysses by his advice won him over to a fine scheme. The same Ulysses along with Diomede was sent to get Iphigenia, and when he came to Clytemnestra her mother, he falsely said she was to be given in marriage to Achilles." (Fabulae §98, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-98-substitution]: "When she was brought to Aulis, and her father was about to sacrifice her, Diana pitied the girl, cast mist about her, and substituted a deer in her place." (Fabulae §98, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-98-priestess]: "She bore Iphigenia through the clouds to the Tauric land, and there made her a priestess of her temple." (Fabulae §98, trans. Mary Grant)

### Actaeon (§180)

The Fabulae gives a brief account of Actaeon's punishment. "Actaeon, son of Aristaeus and Autonoe, a shepherd, saw Diana bathing and desired to ravish her."[^hyg-180-saw] The punishment was transformation: "Angry at this, Diana made horns grow on his head, and he was devoured by his own dogs."[^hyg-180-punishment]

[^hyg-180-saw]: "Actaeon, son of Aristaeus and Autonoe, a shepherd, saw Diana bathing and desired to ravish her." (Fabulae §180, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-180-punishment]: "Angry at this, Diana made horns grow on his head, and he was devoured by his own dogs." (Fabulae §180, trans. Mary Grant)

## In the Iliad

### Slayer of Mortals (Book VI)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book VI, Artemis is named twice as the slayer of mortal women:

In Glaukos's account of Bellerophon, after Bellerophon's line was cursed: "his daughter was slain in wrath of gold-gleaming Artemis."[^il6-bellerophon] (The translation notes this may also be read as "Artemis of the golden reins.")

In Andromache's lament, she tells how Achilles destroyed her family but spared her mother for ransom: "but in her father's halls was she smitten by the Archer Artemis."[^il6-andromache]

Both passages show Artemis as a bringer of death to women, striking suddenly and without elaboration.

[^il6-bellerophon]: "his daughter was slain in wrath of gold-gleaming Artemis" (Iliad VI.3641-3642, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il6-andromache]: "in her father's halls was she smitten by the Archer Artemis" (Iliad VI.3859)

## In the Bibliotheca

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) adds several significant details about Artemis.

### Birth and Midwifery

[Leto](leto.md) came to Delos and "brought forth first Artemis, by the help of whose midwifery she afterwards gave birth to [Apollo](apollo.md)."[^apd-art-midwife]

> **NEW DETAIL:** Artemis as midwife at Apollo's birth is not found in the [Homeric Hymn to Apollo](../sources/homeric-hymns.md), where Eileithyia serves as birth-goddess. Here Artemis, born first, assists with her twin's delivery.

### Virginity

"Artemis devoted herself to the chase and remained a maid."[^apd-art-maid]

### Slaying of Orion

Artemis slew Orion in Delos. The text gives two variant causes: "Orion was killed, as some say, for challenging Artemis to a match at quoits, but some say he was shot by Artemis for offering violence to Opis, one of the maidens who had come from the Hyperboreans."[^apd-art-orion]

> **VARIANT:** The [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) (V) says Artemis slew Orion in Ortygia after [Eos](eos.md) took him as a lover. The Bibliotheca places the killing in Delos and offers two different motives — a quoits challenge, or violence against the Hyperborean maiden Opis.

### In the Gigantomachy

During the [Gigantomachy](../creatures/giants.md), "Artemis slew Gration."[^apd-art-gration]

[^apd-art-midwife]: "she came to Delos and brought forth first Artemis, by the help of whose midwifery she afterwards gave birth to Apollo." (Bibliotheca 1.4.1, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-art-maid]: "Artemis devoted herself to the chase and remained a maid" (Bibliotheca 1.4.1, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-art-orion]: "Orion was killed, as some say, for challenging Artemis to a match at quoits, but some say he was shot by Artemis for offering violence to Opis, one of the maidens who had come from the Hyperboreans." (Bibliotheca 1.4.5, trans. Frazer)
[^apd-art-gration]: "Artemis slew Gration" (Bibliotheca 1.6.2, trans. Frazer)

## In the Bibliotheca (2.5.3)

### The Cerynitian Hind

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) describes the Cerynitian hind, the object of [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md)' third labour, as sacred to Artemis: "the hind was at Oenoe; it had golden horns and was sacred to Artemis."[^apd-art-hind-desc] Heracles hunted it for a full year without killing or wounding it. When he finally shot it crossing the river Ladon, "Artemis with [Apollo](apollo.md) met him, and would have wrested the hind from him, and rebuked him for attempting to kill her sacred animal."[^apd-art-hind] Heracles "appeased the anger of the goddess" by pleading necessity and blaming Eurystheus.

[^apd-art-hind-desc]: "the hind was at Oenoe; it had golden horns and was sacred to Artemis" (Bibliotheca 2.5.3, trans. J.G. Frazer)
[^apd-art-hind]: "Artemis with Apollo met him, and would have wrested the hind from him, and rebuked him for attempting to kill her sacred animal" (Bibliotheca 2.5.3, trans. J.G. Frazer)

## In the Odyssey

### Slaying Orion (Book V)

In Calypso's bitter speech against the gods' jealousy, Artemis is named as the instrument of Orion's death after [Eos](eos.md) took him as her lover: "Even so when rosy-fingered Dawn took Orion for her lover, ye gods that live at ease were jealous thereof, till chaste Artemis, of the golden throne, slew him in Ortygia with the visitation of her gentle shafts."[^od5-orion]

[^od5-orion]: "Even so when rosy-fingered Dawn took Orion for her lover, ye gods that live at ease were jealous thereof, till chaste Artemis, of the golden throne, slew him in Ortygia with the visitation of her gentle shafts" (Odyssey V.3095-3098, trans. Butcher and Lang)

## In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md)

### Actaeon (3.138-252)

Ovid's account of Actaeon's death emphasises the accidental nature of his transgression. While Actaeon's companions rested from the hunt, he "wandering through the unknown woods, entered the precincts of that sacred grove; with steps uncertain wandered he as fate directed."[^met-art-actaeon1] He stumbled upon Artemis (Diana) bathing in her grotto at Gargaphia. She stood "head and shoulders taller than her guards" as her nymphs rushed to shield her. Without her arrows at hand, she splashed water in his face and taunted: "Go tell it, if your tongue can tell the tale, your bold eyes saw me stripped of all my robes."[^met-art-actaeon2]

Immediately Actaeon sprouted stag horns, his hands and feet transformed, and "his courage turned to fear." His own pack of hounds — Ovid names dozens — tore him to pieces while his companions called his name, unaware that the stag before them was their master. "'Tis said Diana's fury raged with none abatement till the torn flesh ceased to live."[^met-art-actaeon3]

Ovid insists Actaeon's death was fortune's crime, not guilt: "who maintains mistakes are crimes?"

### Callisto (2.401-530)

[Zeus](zeus.md) seduced the nymph Callisto by disguising himself as Artemis — a detail unique to Ovid. Callisto's pregnancy was discovered when "in a clear brook she waded, loathe to wet her tender bosom; and she could not hide her secret shame."[^met-art-callisto] Artemis drove her from the company of virgins, and [Hera](hera.md) completed the punishment by transforming Callisto into a bear. Years later, when Callisto's son Arcas nearly killed her with a javelin, Zeus snatched both up and set them as the constellations Great and Little Bear.

### Niobe's Daughters (6.268-312)

After [Apollo](apollo.md) slew Niobe's seven sons, Artemis completed the punishment by shooting her seven daughters. The sisters fell as they mourned their brothers, and Niobe tried to shield the last one: "Leave me one, the littlest one!" But even as she prayed, the last daughter was struck down.[^met-art-niobe] Ovid describes Niobe hardened into stone by grief, weeping even as marble.

[^met-art-actaeon1]: "wandering through the unknown woods, entered the precincts of that sacred grove; with steps uncertain wandered he as fate directed" (Metamorphoses 3.174-177, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-art-actaeon2]: "Go tell it, if your tongue can tell the tale, your bold eyes saw me stripped of all my robes" (Metamorphoses 3.192-193, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-art-actaeon3]: "'Tis said Diana's fury raged with none abatement till the torn flesh ceased to live" (Metamorphoses 3.251-252, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-art-callisto]: "in a clear brook she waded, loathe to wet her tender bosom; and she could not hide her secret shame" (Metamorphoses 2.461-463, trans. Brookes More)
[^met-art-niobe]: "Leave me one, the littlest one!" (Metamorphoses 6.299, trans. Brookes More)

### The Calydonian Boar (Book IX)

In Phoenix's tale, Artemis punished King Oineus for failing to sacrifice to her: "Artemis of the golden throne had brought a plague upon them, in wrath that Oineus offered her not the harvest first-fruits on the fat of his garden land; for all the other gods had their feast of hecatombs, and only to the daughter of great [Zeus](zeus.md) offered he not, whether he forgat or marked it not; and therein sinned he sore in his heart. So the Archer-goddess was wroth and sent against him a creature of heaven, a fierce wild boar, white-tusked, that wrought sore ill continually on Oineus' garden land."[^il9-boar]

Meleager slew the boar "having gathered together from many cities huntsmen and hounds; for not of few men could the boar be slain, so mighty was he." Then Artemis "made much turmoil over him and tumult concerning the boar's head and shaggy hide," leading to war between the Kuretes and Aitolians.[^il9-aftermath]

[^il9-boar]: "Artemis of the golden throne had brought a plague upon them, in wrath that Oineus offered her not the harvest first-fruits on the fat of his garden land; for all the other gods had their feast of hecatombs, and only to the daughter of great Zeus offered he not, whether he forgat or marked it not; and therein sinned he sore in his heart.
