## Overview

**Asclepius** was the son of [Apollo](apollo.md) and the mortal Coronis, raised by [Chiron](../creatures/chiron.md) the centaur and taught the arts of healing. He became so skilled in medicine that he could raise the dead, for which [Zeus](zeus.md) destroyed him with a thunderbolt. After death he was worshipped as a god of healing; in the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md), his prophesied destiny was to go "from a god... to dust, and once again from dust become a God."

## In the [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md)

The Iliad refers to Asclepius only as the father of the Greek healers at Troy. "Asklepios' two sons were leaders, the cunning leeches Podaleirios and Machaon" who commanded thirty ships from Oichalia.[^il-sons] He is called "Asklepios the noble leech" and "Asklepios the good leech."[^il-leech]

[^il-sons]: "Asklepios' two sons were leaders, the cunning leeches Podaleirios and Machaon" (Iliad 2.1458-1459, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
[^il-leech]: "Machaon hither, the hero son of Asklepios the noble leech" (Iliad 4.2250-2251); "Machaon, son of Asklepios the good leech" (Iliad 11.6654-6655)

### Death by Thunderbolt (Fragment 90)

[Zeus](zeus.md) killed Asclepius for raising the dead: "the father of men and gods was wrath, and from Olympus he smote the son of Leto with a lurid thunderbolt and killed him, arousing the anger of Phoebus."[^cat-death]

## In the [Metamorphoses](../sources/metamorphoses.md)

### Birth and Prophecy (2.633-654)

After [Apollo](apollo.md) rescued the infant from Coronis's funeral pyre, [Chiron](../creatures/chiron.md) raised the child. Chiron's daughter Ocyroe, seized by prophetic frenzy, foretold Asclepius's destiny: "O thou who wilt bestow on all the world the blessed boon of health, increase in strength! To thee shall mortals often owe their lives: to thee is given the power to raise the dead."[^met-prophecy]

She also prophesied his destruction and apotheosis: "But when against the power of Deities thou shalt presume to dare thy mortal skill, the bolts of Jove will shatter thy great might, and health no more be thine from thence to grant. And from a god thou shalt return to dust, and once again from dust become a God; and thou shalt thus renew thy destiny."[^met-apotheosis]

### The Serpent of Epidaurus (15.622-744)

When plague ravaged Rome, envoys consulted the oracle at Delphi. [Apollo](apollo.md) directed them not to himself but to his son: "you do not need Apollo to relieve your wasting plague, you need Apollo's son. Go then to him with a good omen and invite his aid."[^met-oracle]

The Romans sailed to Epidaurus and petitioned the Greek elders for their god. While the council debated, Asclepius appeared in a dream to the Roman leader, "holding in his left hand a rustic staff. Stroking his long beard with his right," he promised: "I will come to you, and leave my altar. But now look well at the serpent with its binding folds entwined around this staff, and accurately mark it with your eyes that you may recognize it. I will transform myself into this shape but of a greater size."[^met-dream]

The next morning, the god manifested in his temple as a great serpent: "the god all glittering with gold and as a serpent, crest erect, sent forth a hissing as to notify a quick approach — and in his coming shook his statue and the altars and the doors, the marble pavement and the gilded roof."[^met-serpent] The priest recognized him: "Behold the god! It is the god."[^met-priest]

"Nodding well pleased and moving his great crest, the god at once assured them of his favor and hissed repeatedly with darting tongue."[^met-nod] He glided down the polished steps, gazed back at his old altars in farewell, and wound through the town to the harbor. He placed "his mighty body in the Ausonian ship, which plainly showed the great weight of the god."[^met-weight]

The serpent-god journeyed by sea along the coast of Italy, passing the Lacinian Cape, Scylacean coasts, and many other landmarks. He sailed past "the Cumaean [Sibyl](../heroes/sibyl.md)'s temple" and up the Tiber, where "all the people of Rome came rushing out — mothers and fathers and even those who tend your sacred fire, O Trojan goddess Vesta — and joyous shouted welcome to the god."[^met-rome] Altars lined both banks with frankincense and sacrificial blood.

Finally, "the serpent child of Phoebus left the Roman ship, took his own heavenly form, and brought the mourning city health once more."[^met-cure] He settled on an island in the Tiber where the river divides.

## In the [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md)

### Birth and Training (3.10.3)

[Apollo](apollo.md) "snatched the babe from the pyre and brought it to [Chiron](../creatures/chiron.md), the centaur, by whom he was brought up and taught the arts of healing and hunting."[^apd-birth] His surgical skill surpassed all others: "he not only prevented some from dying, but even raised up the dead."[^apd-skill]

Among those he was said to have raised: "Capaneus and Lycurgus... Hippolytus... and Tyndareus, Hymenaeus, and Glaucus son of Minos."[^apd-raised]

### Death (3.10.4)

"[Zeus](zeus.md), fearing that men might acquire the healing art from him and so come to the rescue of each other, smote him with a thunderbolt."[^apd-death] This provoked Apollo to slay the [Cyclopes](../creatures/cyclopes.md) who forged the bolt. Zeus would have hurled Apollo into [Tartarus](../places/tartarus.md), but [Leto](../deities/leto.md) interceded, and Apollo was ordered to serve Admetus at Pherae for a year.[^apd-aftermath]

## In the [Fabulae](../sources/hyginus.md)

### Raising the Dead (§49)

"Aesculapius, son of Apollo, is said to have restored life either to Glaucus, son of Minos, or to Hippolytus, and Jupiter because of this struck him with a thunderbolt."[^hyg-death]

[^hyg-death]: "Aesculapius, son of Apollo, is said to have restored life either to Glaucus, son of Minos, or to Hippolytus, and Jupiter because of this struck him with a thunderbolt" (Fabulae §49, trans. Mary Grant)

## In [Pindar](../sources/pindar.md)

### Birth and the Death of Koronis (Pythian III)

Pindar's Pythian III gives the fullest poetic account of Asclepius's origins. His mother was Koronis, "the daughter of Phlegyas of goodly steeds," who was already pregnant by [Apollo](apollo.md) when she took a second lover, Ischys son of Elatos of Arcady.[^pin-koronis]

Apollo's omniscience is given particular emphasis here: "he gave heed to his own wisdom, his mind that knoweth all things; in lies it hath no part, neither in act or thought may god or man deceive him."[^pin-omniscient] Apollo sent [Artemis](artemis.md) to slay Koronis at Lakereia, "by the steep shores of the Boibian lake." Many neighbours perished with her: "so doth a fire that from one spark has leapt upon a mountain lay waste wide space of wood."[^pin-lakereia]

When her kin placed Koronis on the funeral pyre, Apollo relented at the last moment: "Not any longer may I endure in my soul to slay mine own seed by a most cruel death in company with its mother's grievous fate."[^pin-relent] He acted with divine swiftness: "at the first stride he was there, and from the corpse caught up the child, and the blaze of the burning fiery pile was cloven before him asunder in the midst."[^pin-rescue] He then brought the child to [Chiron](../creatures/chiron.md) to be trained.

### Healing Arts (Pythian III)

Chiron taught Asclepius "to be a healer of the many-plaguing maladies of men." Those who came to him — "whether plagued with self-grown sores or with limbs wounded by the lustrous bronze or stone far-hurled, or marred by summer heat or winter cold" — he delivered from their afflictions "some with emollient spells and some by kindly potions, or else he hung their limbs with charms, or by surgery he raised them up to health."[^pin-healing]

### Death by Thunderbolt (Pythian III)

Pindar records the bribery and its consequence: "Yet hath even wisdom been led captive of desire of gain. Even him did gold in his hands glittering beguile for a great reward to bring back from death a man already prisoner thereto: wherefore the hands of the son of Kronos smote the twain of them through the midst, and bereft their breasts of breath, and the bright lightning dealt them doom."[^pin-death] The "twain" refers to Asclepius and the man he raised.

### Brief Mention (Nemean III)

In Nemean III, Chiron's rearing of Asclepius is mentioned alongside that of Jason: "within his cavern of stone did deep-counselled Cheiron rear Jason, and next Asklepios, whom he taught to apportion healing drugs with gentle hand."[^pin-nem3]

[^pin-koronis]: "the daughter of Phlegyas of goodly steeds not yet delivered by Eileithuia aid of mothers, ere by the golden bow she was slain at the hands of Artemis... she had lain with Phoibos of the unshorn hair, and bare within her the seed of a very god... for she lay in the couch of a stranger that was come from Arcady" (Pindar, Pythian III, trans. Ernest Myers)
[^pin-omniscient]: "he gave heed to his own wisdom, his mind that knoweth all things; in lies it hath no part, neither in act or thought may god or man deceive him" (Pindar, Pythian III, trans. Ernest Myers)
[^pin-lakereia]: "he sent his sister fierce with terrible wrath to go to Lakereia--for by the steep shores of the Boibian lake was the home of her virginity--and thus a doom adverse blasted her life and smote her down: and of her neighbours many fared ill therefore and perished with her: so doth a fire that from one spark has leapt upon a mountain lay waste wide space of wood" (Pindar, Pythian III, trans. Ernest Myers)
[^pin-relent]: "Not any longer may I endure in my soul to slay mine own seed by a most cruel death in company with its mother's grievous fate" (Pindar, Pythian III, trans. Ernest Myers)
[^pin-rescue]: "at the first stride he was there, and from the corpse caught up the child, and the blaze of the burning fiery pile was cloven before him asunder in the midst" (Pindar, Pythian III, trans. Ernest Myers)
[^pin-healing]: "all that came unto him whether plagued with self-grown sores or with limbs wounded by the lustrous bronze or stone far-hurled, or marred by summer heat or winter cold--these he delivered, loosing each from his several infirmity, some with emollient spells and some by kindly potions, or else he hung their limbs with charms, or by surgery he raised them up to health" (Pindar, Pythian III, trans. Ernest Myers)
[^pin-death]: "Yet hath even wisdom been led captive of desire of gain. Even him did gold in his hands glittering beguile for a great reward to bring back from death a man already prisoner thereto: wherefore the hands of the son of Kronos smote the twain of them through the midst, and bereft their breasts of breath, and the bright lightning dealt them doom" (Pindar, Pythian III, trans.

## Variant Traditions

The sources differ on whom Asclepius raised from the dead. The Bibliotheca gives a long list including Capaneus, Lycurgus, Hippolytus, Tyndareus, Hymenaeus, and Glaucus. The Fabulae gives only two candidates — "either Glaucus, son of Minos, or Hippolytus" — expressing uncertainty between them.
