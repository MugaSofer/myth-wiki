## Overview

**Calypso** is a goddess who detained [Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md) on the remote isle of Ogygia for seven years, offering him immortality if he would remain as her husband. She is best known from [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) Book V, where [Zeus](zeus.md) sends [Hermes](hermes.md) to command her to release Odysseus. Her parentage is disputed: the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) calls her "the daughter of [Atlas](atlas.md)," while the [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md) lists her among the Oceanids, daughters of Ocean and Tethys.

## Appearance

Calypso is more beautiful than mortal women. When she proposes that Odysseus stay, she says: "Not in sooth that I avow me to be less noble than she in form or fashion, for it is in no wise meet that mortal women should match them with immortals, in shape and comeliness."[^od5-form] Odysseus concedes the point: "wise [Penelope](../heroes/penelope.md) is meaner to look upon than thou, in comeliness and stature. But she is mortal and thou knowest not age nor death."[^od5-penelope]

Her clothing is described when she goes to find Odysseus after Hermes's visit: she "clad her in a great shining robe, light of woof and gracious, and about her waist she cast a fair golden girdle, and a veil withal upon her head."[^od5-attire]

[^od5-form]: "Not in sooth that I avow me to be less noble than she in form or fashion, for it is in no wise meet that mortal women should match them with immortals, in shape and comeliness" (Odyssey V.3190-3192)
[^od5-penelope]: "wise Penelope is meaner to look upon than thou, in comeliness and stature. But she is mortal and thou knowest not age nor death" (Odyssey V.3196-3197)
[^od5-attire]: "the nymph clad her in a great shining robe, light of woof and gracious, and about her waist she cast a fair golden girdle, and a veil withal upon her head" (Odyssey V.3209-3211)

## Powers

- **Offer of immortality:** She claimed the power to make Odysseus immortal and ageless: "I said that I would make him to know not death and age for ever."[^od5-immortality]
- **Weaving:** She wove "with a shuttle of gold."[^od5-weaving]
- **Navigation:** She instructed Odysseus in celestial navigation, telling him to keep the Bear on his left as he crossed the sea.[^od5-navigation]

[^od5-weaving]: "the nymph within was singing with a sweet voice as she fared to and fro before the loom, and wove with a shuttle of gold" (Odyssey V.3041-3042)
[^od5-navigation]: "This star, Calypso, the fair goddess, bade him to keep ever on the left as he traversed the deep" (Odyssey V.3248-3249)

## Her Island

Ogygia is remote — [Hermes](hermes.md) complains that no mortal cities are near — but beautiful enough to make even a god marvel. When Hermes arrives:

"On the hearth there was a great fire burning, and from afar through the isle was smelt the fragrance of cleft cedar blazing, and of sandal wood. And the nymph within was singing with a sweet voice as she fared to and fro before the loom, and wove with a shuttle of gold. And round about the cave there was a wood blossoming, alder and poplar and sweet-smelling cypress. And therein roosted birds long of wing, owls and falcons and chattering sea-crows, which have their business in the waters. And lo, there about the hollow cave trailed a gadding garden vine, all rich with clusters. And fountains four set orderly were running with clear water, hard by one another, turned each to his own course. And all around soft meadows bloomed of violets and parsley, yea, even a deathless god who came thither might wonder at the sight and be glad at heart."[^od5-ogygia]

[^od5-ogygia]: (Odyssey V.3038-3051, trans. Butcher and Lang)

## In the Odyssey

### Detaining Odysseus (Books I, V)

In [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) Book I, Calypso is introduced holding Odysseus captive: "the lady nymph Calypso held, that fair goddess, in her hollow caves, longing to have him for her lord."[^od1-lady] All the gods pitied Odysseus "save [Poseidon](poseidon.md), who raged continually against godlike Odysseus."[^od1-poseidon]

[Athena](athena.md) describes his plight to [Zeus](zeus.md): "he lieth in an island suffering strong pains, in the halls of the nymph Calypso, who holdeth him perforce; so he may not reach his own country, for he hath no ships by him with oars."[^od5-perforce]

Odysseus himself, when found by Hermes, "sat weeping on the shore even as aforetime, straining his soul with tears, and groans, and griefs, and as he wept he looked wistfully over the unharvested deep." By night "he would sleep by her, as needs he must, in the hollow caves, unwilling lover by a willing lady."[^od5-unwilling]

[^od1-poseidon]: "all the gods had pity on him save Poseidon, who raged continually against godlike Odysseus, till he came to his own country" (Odyssey I.747-748)
[^od5-perforce]: "he lieth in an island suffering strong pains, in the halls of the nymph Calypso, who holdeth him perforce" (Odyssey V.2995-2996)
[^od5-unwilling]: "by night he would sleep by her, as needs he must, in the hollow caves, unwilling lover by a willing lady. And in the day-time he would sit on the rocks and on the beach, straining his soul with tears, and groans, and griefs" (Odyssey V.3129-3132)

### The Gods' Jealousy (Book V)

When [Hermes](hermes.md) delivers [Zeus](zeus.md)'s command, Calypso delivers a bitter speech against the gods' double standard. She protests that the gods grudge goddesses their mortal lovers, citing [Eos](eos.md) and Orion (killed by [Artemis](artemis.md)) and [Demeter](demeter.md) and Iasion (killed by Zeus's thunderbolt).[^od5-jealousy] She asserts her own claim: "Him I saved as he went all alone bestriding the keel of a bark, for that Zeus had crushed and cleft his swift ship with a white bolt in the midst of the wine-dark deep... And him have I loved and cherished."[^od5-loved]

Yet she yields: "forasmuch as it is no wise possible for another god to go beyond, or make void the purpose of Zeus, lord of the aegis, let him away over the unharvested seas."[^od5-yield]

[^od5-jealousy]: "Hard are ye gods and jealous exceeding, who ever grudge goddesses openly to mate with men, if any make a mortal her dear bed-fellow" (Odyssey V.3093-3094)
[^od5-loved]: "Him I saved as he went all alone bestriding the keel of a bark... And him have I loved and cherished, and I said that I would make him to know not death and age for ever" (Odyssey V.3102-3108)
[^od5-yield]: "forasmuch as it is no wise possible for another god to go beyond, or make void the purpose of Zeus, lord of the aegis, let him away over the unharvested seas" (Odyssey V.3108-3110)

### The Farewell (Book V)

Calypso tells Odysseus he may go, offering to help him build a raft. When he suspects a trick, she swears a great oath by the Styx and reveals something of her character: "I too have a righteous mind, and my heart within me is not of iron, but pitiful even as thine."[^od5-pitiful]

She makes one last attempt to dissuade him, comparing herself to [Penelope](../heroes/penelope.md) and warning of the suffering ahead. Odysseus's response is both gracious and final: "Be not wroth with me hereat, goddess and queen. Myself I know it well, how wise Penelope is meaner to look upon than thou, in comeliness and stature. But she is mortal and thou knowest not age nor death. Yet even so, I wish and long day by day to fare homeward."[^od5-farewell]

She then helps him practically: showing him where tall trees grow, providing augers and web of cloth for sails, bathing him, clothing him in fragrant attire, provisioning the raft with wine, water, and corn, and sending a warm and gentle wind.[^od5-provisions]

[^od5-pitiful]: "I too have a righteous mind, and my heart within me is not of iron, but pitiful even as thine" (Odyssey V.3165-3166)
[^od5-farewell]: "Myself I know it well, how wise Penelope is meaner to look upon than thou, in comeliness and stature. But she is mortal and thou knowest not age nor death. Yet even so, I wish and long day by day to fare homeward and see the day of my returning" (Odyssey V.3196-3199)
[^od5-provisions]: "the fair Calypso sent him on his way from the island, when she had bathed him and clad him in fragrant attire. Moreover, the goddess placed on board the ship two skins, one of dark wine, and another, a great one, of water, and corn too in a wallet, and she set therein a store of dainties to his heart's desire, and sent forth a warm and gentle wind to blow" (Odyssey V.3238-3243)

### Other References

Odysseus recalls Calypso when telling the Phaeacians his story: "there dwells the daughter of [Atlas](atlas.md), crafty Calypso, of the braided tresses, an awful goddess, nor is any either of gods or mortals conversant with her." He says she "cherished me and gave me sustenance, and said that she would make me to know not death nor age for all my days; but never did she win my heart within me."[^od7-recall]

Later, in Book IX, he compares Calypso and [Circe](circe.md): "Verily Calypso, the fair goddess, would fain have kept me with her in her hollow caves, longing to have me for her lord; and likewise too, guileful Circe of Aia, would have stayed me in her halls, longing to have me for her lord. But never did they prevail upon my heart within my breast."[^od9-compare]

In Book XII, Odysseus reports that Calypso told him of [Zeus](zeus.md)'s vow to destroy his ship: "This I heard from Calypso of the fair hair; and she said that she herself had heard it from [Hermes](hermes.md) the Messenger."[^od12-fairhair]

[^od7-recall]: "crafty Calypso, of the braided tresses, an awful goddess, nor is any either of gods or mortals conversant with her... She took me in, and with all care she cherished me and gave me sustenance, and said that she would make me to know not death nor age for all my days; but never did she win my heart within me" (Odyssey VII.4040-4050)
[^od9-compare]: "Verily Calypso, the fair goddess, would fain have kept me with her in her hollow caves, longing to have me for her lord; and likewise too, guileful Circe of Aia, would have stayed me in her halls, longing to have me for her lord. But never did they prevail upon my heart within my breast" (Odyssey IX.4760-4764)

## In the Theogony

The [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md) lists Calypso twice. She first appears in the catalogue of Oceanids, daughters of Ocean and Tethys: "charming Calypso" is named among "the eldest daughters that sprang from Ocean and Tethys."[^theog-oceanid]

Later, she appears in the catalogue of goddesses who bore children to mortal men: "the bright goddess Calypso was joined to Odysseus in sweet love, and bare him Nausithous and Nausinous."[^theog-bright]

[^theog-oceanid]: "Asia and charming Calypso, Eudora, and Tyche, Amphirho, and Ocyrrhoe, and Styx who is the chiefest of them all. These are the eldest daughters that sprang from Ocean and Tethys" (Theogony 359-362, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## In the Bibliotheca

The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) gives a compressed account. After Odysseus's ship was wrecked, "Calypso, daughter of [Atlas](atlas.md), received him, and bedding with him bore a son Latinus. He stayed with her five years, and then made a raft and sailed away."[^apd-calypso]

> **VARIANT:** The Bibliotheca says Odysseus stayed five years (E.7.24), the [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) says seven (VII.4051), and the [Fabulae](../sources/hyginus.md) says one year (§125). The child named here — Latinus — differs from the Theogony's Nausithous and Nausinous.

[^apd-calypso]: "There Calypso, daughter of Atlas, received him, and bedding with him bore a son Latinus. He stayed with her five years, and then made a raft and sailed away" (Bibliotheca E.7.24, trans. J.G. Frazer)

## In the Fabulae

In the [Fabulae](../sources/hyginus.md), Calypso appears in the Odyssey summary (§125): "the nymph Calypso, daughter of [Atlas](atlas.md), lived. She enamoured of the handsome form of Ulysses, kept him a whole year, and was unwilling to release him until [Hermes](hermes.md), by [Zeus](zeus.md)'s command, bade her release him."[^hyg-125]

She is also listed among women who committed suicide: "Calypso, daughter of [Atlas](atlas.md), out of love for Ulysses, killed herself."[^hyg-243]

> **VARIANT:** The Fabulae says Calypso kept Odysseus only one year (§125), far shorter than the Odyssey's seven or the Bibliotheca's five. The claim that she killed herself for love (§243) has no parallel in the other sources.

In the genealogical preface, Hyginus lists Calypso among the children of [Atlas](atlas.md) and Pleione, alongside the Pleiades (Maia, Alcyone, Merope, Electra, Celaeno).[^hyg-gen]

[^hyg-125]: "the nymph Calypso, daughter of Atlas, lived. She enamoured of the handsome form of Ulysses, kept him a whole year, and was unwilling to release him until Mercury, by Jove's command, bade her release him" (Fabulae §125, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-243]: "Calypso, daughter of Atlas, out of love for Ulysses, killed herself" (Fabulae §243, trans. Mary Grant)
[^hyg-gen]: "From Atlas and Pleione, Maia, Calypso, Alcyone, Merope, Electra, Celaeno" (Fabulae, Genealogies §p.9, trans. Mary Grant)

## Variant Traditions

### Parentage

Calypso's parentage is reported differently across sources. The [Theogony](../sources/theogony.md) lists her among the Oceanids, daughters of Ocean and Tethys (359). The [Odyssey](../sources/odyssey.md) calls her "the daughter of [Atlas](atlas.md)" (VII.4040). The [Fabulae](../sources/hyginus.md) lists her among the children of Atlas and Pleione (§p.9), grouping her with the Pleiades. The [Bibliotheca](../sources/apollodorus.md) also calls her "daughter of Atlas" (E.7.24).
