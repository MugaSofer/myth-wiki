## Overview

**Eileithyia** is the goddess of childbirth, daughter of [Zeus](zeus.md) and [Hera](hera.md). She appears both as a single goddess and in plural form (the Eilithyiai), and her presence or absence determines whether a birth can proceed.

## Birth

[Hera](hera.md) "was joined in love with the king of gods and men, and brought forth [Hebe](hebe.md) and [Ares](ares.md) and Eileithyia."[^theog-birth]

[^theog-birth]: "she was joined in love with the king of gods and men, and brought forth Hebe and Ares and Eileithyia" (Theogony 921-923, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Opposing Apollo's Birth (Hymn to Apollo)

In the [Homeric Hymn to Apollo](../sources/homeric-hymns.md) (III), [Hera](hera.md) deliberately kept Eileithyia away from [Leto](leto.md) during her labour on Delos: "Only Eilithyia, goddess of sore travail, had not heard of Leto's trouble, for she sat on the top of Olympus beneath golden clouds by white-armed Hera's contriving, who kept her close through envy, because Leto with the lovely tresses was soon to bear a son faultless and strong."[^hh3-envy]

The other goddesses sent [Iris](iris.md) to fetch her. When Eileithyia arrived, "the pains of birth seized Leto, and she longed to bring forth; so she cast her arms about a palm tree and kneeled on the soft meadow while the earth laughed for joy beneath. Then the child leaped forth to the light."[^hh3-birth]

[^hh3-envy]: "Only Eilithyia, goddess of sore travail, had not heard of Leto's trouble, for she sat on the top of Olympus beneath golden clouds by white-armed Hera's contriving, who kept her close through envy" (Homeric Hymn III to Apollo 97-100)
[^hh3-birth]: "the pains of birth seized Leto, and she longed to bring forth; so she cast her arms about a palm tree and kneeled on the soft meadow while the earth laughed for joy beneath. Then the child leaped forth to the light, and all the goddesses washed you purely and cleanly with sweet water" (Homeric Hymn III to Apollo 115-120)

## In the Iliad

### The Eilithyiai as Daughters of Hera (Book XI)

In [Iliad](../sources/iliad.md) Book XI, when Agamemnon is wounded, his pain is compared to the pangs of childbirth sent by the Eilithyiai, who are identified as [Hera](hera.md)'s daughters: "even as when the keen shaft cometh upon a woman in her travail, the piercing shaft that the goddesses of the birth-pangs send, even the Eilithyiai, the daughters of Hera that have bitter pangs in their gift."[^il11-eilithyiai]

This passage uses the plural form, treating the Eilithyiai as multiple birth-goddesses rather than a single deity.

[^il11-eilithyiai]: "even as when the keen shaft cometh upon a woman in her travail, the piercing shaft that the goddesses of the birth-pangs send, even the Eilithyiai, the daughters of Hera that have bitter pangs in their gift" (Iliad 11.269-272, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)

### Delaying Heracles' Birth (Book XIX)

In Agamemnon's speech about Ate, [Hera](hera.md) is recalled tricking [Zeus](zeus.md) over [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md)' birth. Zeus swore that the child born that day of his lineage would rule, and Hera delayed Alkmene's labour while hastening Eurystheus's birth, so that Eurystheus was born first and gained lordship over Heracles.[^il19-heracles]

[^il19-heracles]: Hera delayed Alkmene and hastened Eurystheus's birth; Zeus groaned "when he beheld his beloved son in cruel travail at Eurystheus' hest" (Iliad XIX, trans. Lang, Leaf, and Myers)
