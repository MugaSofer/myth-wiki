## Overview

**Oceanus** is the eldest of the [Titans](titans.md), a deep-swirling river that encircles the world.

## Birth

Oceanus is listed first among the children of [Gaia](gaia.md) and [Uranus](uranus.md): "she lay with Heaven and bare deep-swirling Oceanus, [Coeus](coeus.md) and [Crius](crius.md) and [Hyperion](hyperion.md) and [Iapetus](iapetus.md), [Theia](theia.md) and [Rhea](rhea.md), [Themis](themis.md) and [Mnemosyne](mnemosyne.md) and gold-crowned [Phoebe](phoebe.md) and lovely [Tethys](tethys.md)."[^theog-birth]

[^theog-birth]: "she lay with Heaven and bare deep-swirling Oceanus, Coeus and Crius and Hyperion and Iapetus, Theia and Rhea, Themis and Mnemosyne and gold-crowned Phoebe and lovely Tethys" (Theogony 132-136, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## Children

[Tethys](tethys.md) bare to Oceanus eddying rivers and a "holy company of daughters" — three thousand Oceanids "who are dispersed far and wide, and in every place alike serve the earth and the deep waters."[^theog-children]

[^theog-children]: "Tethys bare to Ocean eddying rivers, Nilus, and Alpheus, and deep-swirling Eridanus..." and "there are three thousand neat-ankled daughters of Ocean who are dispersed far and wide, and in every place alike serve the earth and the deep waters, children who are glorious among goddesses" (Theogony 334-370, trans. H.G. Evelyn-White)

## In Aeschylus' [Prometheus Bound](../sources/aeschylus-prometheus-bound.md)

Oceanus arrives mounted on a griffin to visit [Prometheus](prometheus.md) on his rock. He is characterized as well-meaning but cautious, urging Prometheus to submit: "A despot rules, harsh, resolute, supreme, whose law is will. Yet shall I go to him, with all endeavour to relieve thy plight — so thou wilt curb the tempest of thy tongue!"[^pb-oceanus-counsel] He offers to intercede with [Zeus](zeus.md) and insists: "I, Oceanus, am best of all thy friends, and trustiest."[^pb-oceanus-friend]

Prometheus rejects his help, fearing the consequences for Oceanus and not wanting others drawn into his punishment: "I will not ease my woe by base relief in knowing others too involved therein."[^pb-oceanus-reject] He warns Oceanus to remember [Atlas](atlas.md)'s fate and [Typho](../creatures/typhoeus.md)'s doom. Oceanus departs on his "hippogriff," persuaded to return home.

The Chorus identifies Prometheus's bride Hesione as one of their sisters — making Oceanus Prometheus's father-in-law in this tradition.

[^pb-oceanus-counsel]: "A despot rules, harsh, resolute, supreme, whose law is will. Yet shall I go to him, with all endeavour to relieve thy plight" (Prometheus Bound ~300-305, trans. E.D.A. Morshead)
[^pb-oceanus-friend]: "I, Oceanus, am best of all thy friends, and trustiest" (Prometheus Bound ~290, trans. E.D.A. Morshead)
