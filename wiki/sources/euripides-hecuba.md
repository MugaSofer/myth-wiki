## Overview

Euripides' Hecuba dramatizes two connected tragedies for the fallen queen of [Troy](../places/troy.md): the sacrifice of her daughter Polyxena at [Achilles](../heroes/achilles.md)' tomb, and the murder of her son Polydorus by the Thracian king Polymestor for gold. The play centers on questions of [justice](../concepts/justice.md), guest-friendship (xenia), and whether extreme suffering justifies savage revenge.

## Contents

### Prologue: Ghost of Polydorus (1-58)
The ghost of Polydorus, youngest son of Priam and [Hecuba](../heroes/hecuba.md), speaks from beyond death. His father sent him secretly to Polymestor in Thrace with gold for safekeeping. After Troy fell, Polymestor murdered him for the gold and cast his body into the sea. Achilles' ghost has appeared above his tomb demanding Polyxena as a sacrifice.

### Hecuba's Dream and the Chorus (59-215)
Hecuba recounts a terrifying dream — a dappled hind torn by a wolf's fang. The Chorus of captive Trojan women reports the Greek army's debate: [Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md) persuaded them to sacrifice Polyxena to honor Achilles.

### Hecuba and Odysseus (216-443)
Hecuba reminds Odysseus that she once saved his life when he came as a spy to Troy — Helen recognized him, but Hecuba kept his secret. She appeals to xenia and to his debt. Odysseus acknowledges the debt but insists Achilles must be honored. Polyxena delivers a speech refusing to beg, declaring she would rather die free than live a slave.

### Talthybius's Report: Polyxena's Sacrifice (518-582)
The herald Talthybius reports Polyxena's death. She volunteered to die freely, tore open her robe to bare her breast, and spoke: "Lo! strike, if this bosom thou desirest, O youth; or wouldest thou rather under the neck, here is this throat prepared." She died showing care "to fall decently, and to veil from the eyes of men what ought to be concealed." The Greek soldiers honored her with leaves, offerings, and praise.

### Discovery of Polydorus (658-720)
While fetching water to wash Polyxena's body, Hecuba's attendant finds Polydorus's corpse on the shore. Hecuba realizes her dream's meaning and identifies the murderer as Polymestor, her supposed friend.

### Appeal to Agamemnon (726-904)
Hecuba begs Agamemnon for help in avenging Polymestor's violation of guest-friendship. She appeals to law, justice, the gods, and to Agamemnon's relationship with her daughter Cassandra. Agamemnon agrees to allow her revenge but will not act openly.

### The Revenge (953-1022)
Hecuba lures Polymestor into the captive women's tent with a story of hidden Trojan gold. The Trojan women kill his two sons with hidden daggers and gouge out his eyes with their brooches.

### Trial before Agamemnon (1109-1292)
Polymestor claims he killed Polydorus to help the Greeks. Hecuba argues he killed for gold, since he acted only after Troy fell. Agamemnon rules in Hecuba's favor.

### Polymestor's Prophecy (1259-1295)
Polymestor prophesies that Hecuba will be transformed into a dog — "Thou shalt become a dog with a fiery aspect" — and her tomb will be called "the tomb of the wretched dog, a mark to mariners." He also prophesies that Cassandra will die and that Agamemnon will be murdered by his wife: "the murderous bath at Argos awaits thee."
