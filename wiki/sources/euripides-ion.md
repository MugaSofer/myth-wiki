## Overview

The *Ion* tells how [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) raped [Creusa](../heroes/creusa.md), daughter of [Erechtheus](../heroes/erechtheus.md) king of [Athens](../places/athens.md), and she bore a son in secret, exposing him in a cave. Apollo had [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md) carry the infant to [Delphi](../places/delphi.md), where he was raised as a temple servant. Years later, Creusa and her husband Xuthus come to Delphi seeking children. Apollo gives Ion to Xuthus as his "son," but Creusa — not knowing Ion is her lost child — tries to poison him. After a near-fatal recognition scene, [Athena](../deities/athena.md) appears as deus ex machina to reveal the truth: Ion is Apollo's son, destined to found the Ionian race.

The play is notable for its sharp criticism of Apollo's conduct, its exploration of Athenian autochthonous identity, and the repeated motif of mortals questioning divine justice.

## Contents

### Hermes's Prologue
[Hermes](../deities/hermes.md) introduces himself as the son of Maia and [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md), "attendant on the king." He explains the backstory: [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) raped Creusa, daughter of [Erechtheus](../heroes/erechtheus.md), at the cave called Macrai beneath the Athenian Acropolis. She bore a son in secret and exposed him in "a well-compacted ark of circular form," observing the customs of [Erichthonius](../heroes/erichthonius.md) — her ancestor whom [Athena](../deities/athena.md) had raised from the earth and given to the daughters of Aglauros with dragon-guards. Creusa hung her ornaments on the infant and left him to die.

Apollo sent Hermes to retrieve the child: "From the cave deep in the hollow rock a new-born babe, laid as he is, and all his vestments with him; bring to thy brother to my shrine." Hermes carried the ark to Delphi and placed it at the temple entrance. The Priestess found and raised the infant, who grew up tending Apollo's shrine. Meanwhile Creusa married Xuthus, an Aeolian descended from [Aeolus](../heroes/aeolus.md) son of Zeus, who won her hand by helping Athens defeat Euboea. Childless, they come to Delphi. Hermes reveals Apollo's plan: he will give Ion to Xuthus as his son, so Ion may eventually be recognised by Creusa and "through all the states of Greece named Ion, founder of the colonies on the Asiatic coast."

### Ion's Morning Song
Ion enters at dawn to sweep the temple with laurel boughs, sprinkle holy water, and chase birds from the shrine. He sings of his devotion to Apollo — "Phoebus is to me a sire" — and his ignorance of his parents: "A mother's fondness, and a father's care I never knew: the temple of the god claims then my service, for it nurtured me."

### The Temple Decorations
The Chorus of Creusa's handmaidens admire the temple carvings. Ion identifies scenes for them: [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) slaying the Lernean [Hydra](../creatures/hydra.md) with [Iolaus](../heroes/iolaus.md); [Bellerophon](../heroes/bellerophon.md) on [Pegasus](../creatures/pegasus.md) conquering the "triple-bodied monster" (the [Chimaera](../creatures/chimaera.md)); the battle of the [Giants](../creatures/giants.md) — Athena shaking "her gorgon shield" against Enceladus, Zeus launching his thunderbolt against Mimas, and "[Dionysus](../deities/dionysus.md)" (Bacchus) felling "another earth-born monster" with "the wand of Bacchus wreathed with ivy round, no martial spear."

### Creusa and Ion
Creusa enters weeping at the sight of the temple. In conversation with Ion, she reveals the Erechtheid genealogy: Erichthonius raised from the earth by Athena; the daughters of Cecrops who opened the forbidden chest and died; Erechtheus who sacrificed his daughters for their country and was swallowed by the earth, smitten by [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md)'s trident. She speaks of a "friend" who was raped by Apollo and bore a son, now lost — all clearly her own story. Ion is sceptical that Apollo would answer questions about his own misconduct: "How shall the god what he would hide reveal?"

### Ion's Moral Speech
Left alone, Ion reflects on divine injustice: "I must blame the god, if thus perforce he mounts the bed of virgins, and by stealth becomes a father, leaving then his children to die, regardless of them." He argues that if gods punish mortals for crimes, they should hold themselves to the same standard — "if to mortals you shall pay the penalty of forced embraces, thou, Neptune, and Jove, that reigns supreme in heaven, will leave your temples treasureless by paying the mulcts of your injustice."

### Xuthus and the Oracle
Xuthus returns from consulting Trophonius, who told him he would not leave Delphi childless. He enters Apollo's shrine and receives the oracle: the first person he meets on exiting will be his son. He meets Ion and embraces him, to Ion's alarm. Xuthus concludes Ion was conceived during a drunken Bacchic revel at Delphi years ago. Ion resists — he fears the hostility of autochthonous Athens to a foreigner's bastard son — but accepts. Xuthus names him "Ion" for having met him first ("for that he first advanced to meet him"), and orders the Chorus to keep silent on pain of death.

### The Chorus's Dismay
The Chorus laments that Creusa will be childless while her husband has a son: "never may one of alien blood disgrace the imperial honours of that high-born race!" They invoke the Macrai caves and Pan.

### Creusa's Revelation
Creusa's aged Tutor, learning the news, concludes Xuthus has been deceiving her — that Ion is a bastard son he secretly raised. The Tutor urges violence: burn the temple, kill Xuthus, kill Ion. Creusa finally breaks her silence and tells the full truth of Apollo's rape in the Macrai cave: "Thou camest to me, with gold thy locks all glittering, as the vermeil flowers I gather'd in my vest... in my white hand thy hand enlocking, to the cavern'd rock thou led'st me; naught avail'd my cries, that call'd my mother." She exposed her son and believes him dead — "rent by ravenous vultures." She accuses Apollo directly: "Nor here, nor there, O Phoebus, art thou just."

### The Gorgon Blood
Creusa reveals a family heirloom: two drops of blood from the [Gorgon](../creatures/gorgons.md), given by Athena to [Erichthonius](../heroes/erichthonius.md) — "The one works death, the other heals disease." She gives the deadly drop to the Tutor to poison Ion's wine at the feast.

### The Failed Assassination
The Tutor poisons Ion's goblet at the feast, but Ion, superstitious about an ill-omened word, pours his wine on the ground as a libation. A dove drinks the spilled wine and dies in convulsions — "stretching out her scarlet legs, she died." Ion discovers the plot, seizes the Tutor, and the Delphian council sentences Creusa to death by stoning.

### The Recognition
Creusa takes refuge at Apollo's altar. Ion confronts her furiously — "Bull-visaged sire Cephisus, what a viper hast thou produced?" — but the Priestess of Apollo intervenes, bringing the ark in which she found the infant Ion long ago. Creusa recognises it: "I behold the ark, wherein of old I laid thee, O my son." She proves her claim by correctly describing the tokens inside without seeing them: a cloth woven with a Gorgon "like an aegis edged with serpents round" (her own virgin needlework), two golden dragons (Athena's gift, in the tradition of Erichthonius), and a branch of olive from Athena's tree that "never fades." Mother and son are reunited.

### Athena's Epiphany
[Athena](../deities/athena.md) appears as deus ex machina, sent by Apollo — who "unmeet he deems it to show himself before you, lest with blame the past be mention'd." She confirms that Ion is the son of Apollo and Creusa, and that Apollo gave him to Xuthus "not as to the author of thy being... but to the inheritance of a noble house." She prophesies Ion's destiny: "from his root four sons shall spring" — Geleon, Hopletes, Argades, and Aegicores — who will give their names to the four Athenian tribes. The Ionians will colonise the Aegean islands and both continents, "and shall boast their name Ionians, from the honour'd Ion call'd." Creusa and Xuthus will also have a son, Dorus (ancestor of the Dorians), and a grandson Achaeus (ancestor of the Achaeans). Athena concludes: "Well hath Apollo quitted him in all."

Creusa, reconciled, praises Apollo: "My son he now restores, of whom till now I deem'd him heedless. Now these gates are beauteous to mine eyes." The Chorus closes: "the good at length obtain the meed of virtue; but the unholy wretch (such is his nature) never can be happy."
