## Overview

The *Eumenides* (also known as *The Furies*) is the final play of the Oresteia trilogy. It follows [Orestes](../heroes/orestes.md) from [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md)'s temple at [Delphi](../places/delphi.md) to [Athens](../places/athens.md), where [Athena](../deities/athena.md) establishes the court of the [Areopagus](../places/areopagus.md) to try his case. The play resolves the cycle of blood-vengeance through the institution of civic justice and transforms the [Furies](../creatures/erinyes.md) from pursuers of blood-guilt into benevolent guardian spirits of Athens—the Eumenides ("Kindly Ones").

## Contents

### Prologue (~1-63)
The Pythian priestess at [Delphi](../places/delphi.md) recounts the succession of the oracle's holders: [Earth](../deities/gaia.md), Themis, Phoebe, then [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) (given as a birthday gift from Phoebe). She enters the temple and returns in terror, describing [Orestes](../heroes/orestes.md) crouching at the altar, sword in hand, with a band of sleeping creatures around him—"wingless, black," resembling neither Gorgons nor Harpies, dripping poison from their eyes.

### First Episode (~64-234)
Apollo stands over the sleeping [Furies](../creatures/erinyes.md) and tells Orestes to flee to Athens and embrace [Athena](../deities/athena.md)'s statue. He sends [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md) as Orestes' guide. The ghost of [Clytemnestra](../heroes/clytemnestra.md) rises and rouses the sleeping Furies, rebuking them for letting their quarry escape. The Furies awaken and confront Apollo, who drives them from his temple. They argue: the Furies claim matricide is their domain; Apollo argues that Clytemnestra's murder of her husband was equally grave, since marriage is sanctified by [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) and [Hera](../deities/hera.md).

### Parodos (~235-396)
The scene shifts to Athens. Orestes clings to Athena's statue. The Furies arrive, tracking him by the scent of blood. They sing the "binding song"—a chant declaring their ancient office as punishers of those who shed kindred blood: "We are the children of eternal Night."

### Second Episode (~397-489)
Athena arrives, summoned from the Troad where she was claiming land granted to her by the Greek leaders. She questions both parties and declares the matter too great for any single judge—even herself. She will impanel citizens of Athens as jurors, establishing a court on the Hill of [Ares](../deities/ares.md).

### Second Stasimon (~490-565)
The Furies warn that if the old laws of blood-vengeance are overthrown, violence will go unpunished. They praise the "middle way" between tyranny and anarchy.

### The Trial (~566-753)
Apollo appears as Orestes' advocate. The Furies cross-examine: Orestes admits to the killing. Apollo argues that Zeus commanded the vengeance, that Agamemnon's death as a king outweighed all other claims, and—most controversially—that "not the true parent is the woman's womb that bears the child; she doth but nurse the seed new-sown: the male is parent," citing Athena's motherless birth as proof. Athena casts the deciding vote for acquittal, declaring herself "a father's child alone." The votes are tied; Orestes is freed.

### Third Episode (~754-891)
Orestes pledges eternal alliance between [Argos](../places/argos.md) and Athens, then departs. The Furies rage, threatening to blight the land with pestilence. Athena patiently persuades them with the offer of an honoured shrine in Athens, where they will receive worship and ensure the city's prosperity. She reveals that she alone among gods can access Zeus' thunderbolts, but prefers persuasion over force.

### Exodos (~892-1047)
The Furies accept Athena's offer and are transformed into the Eumenides ("Kindly Ones"). They pronounce blessings on Athens: fertility, fair weather, prosperity, and freedom from civil war. Athena leads them in torchlit procession to their new underground shrine beneath the Areopagus.
