## Overview

**Oedipus the King** is a tragedy by Sophocles, widely considered the finest of the Greek tragedies. It dramatizes the moment when Oedipus, king of [Thebes](../places/thebes.md), discovers that he has unknowingly killed his father [Laius](../heroes/laius.md) and married his mother [Jocasta](../heroes/jocasta.md), fulfilling the oracle he had tried to escape. The play opens with Thebes in the grip of a plague and ends with Oedipus blinded by his own hand.

## Contents

### Prologue (1-150)

[Oedipus](../heroes/oedipus.md) addresses Theban suppliants at his palace. A priest of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) describes the plague devastating the city: "A blight is on our harvest in the ear, / A blight upon the grazing flocks and herds, / A blight on wives in travail" (25-27). Oedipus has already sent [Creon](../heroes/creon.md) to [Delphi](../places/delphi.md). Creon returns with [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md)'s command: the city must drive out the murderer of Laius to end the plague.

### First Episode (216-462)

Oedipus pronounces a solemn curse on the unknown murderer: "On his head / I lay this curse: for murderer undetected, / Be he one man, be he a gang, / May he be worn by evil, wretched and forlorn" (246-249). He summons [Teiresias](../heroes/tiresias.md), the blind prophet, who at first refuses to speak. When goaded, Teiresias declares: "Thou art the man, / Thou the accursed polluter of this land" (353-354). Oedipus accuses Teiresias and Creon of conspiracy.

### Second Episode (513-862)

Creon defends himself. Jocasta intervenes and, attempting to discredit prophecy, inadvertently reveals that Laius was killed "at a spot where three roads meet" (716). This triggers Oedipus's fear — he recalls killing a man at such a place. Jocasta recounts the old oracle to Laius: "An oracle / Once came to Laius... / His doom it was to perish by the hand / Of his own child" (711-714). She says the child was exposed on a mountain with pierced ankles.

### Third Episode (911-1085)

A messenger from [Corinth](../places/corinth.md) arrives to announce that Polybus, Oedipus's supposed father, has died of natural causes. Oedipus and Jocasta rejoice — the oracle seems disproved. But the messenger reveals he himself gave the infant Oedipus to Polybus, having received the child from a Theban shepherd on [Cithaeron](../places/cithaeron.md): "thy ankles should attest. / ... / From this affliction thou deriv'st the name / Of Oedipus" (1032-1036). Jocasta, understanding the truth, begs Oedipus to stop his inquiry and flees.

### Fourth Episode (1110-1185)

The old herdsman is brought. Under threat of torture, he confesses: "The child was called his [Laius's] ... / 'Twas I that found thee on Cithaeron's slopes" (1171-1173). He confirms he gave the infant to the Corinthian to save it from death, since "it was foretold that he should slay his sire" (1175).

### Exodos (1186-1530)

A second messenger reports what has happened within: Jocasta has hanged herself. Oedipus, finding her, "from her garment tore / The golden brooches that she wore, / And lifting them struck full upon the balls / Of his own eyes" (1268-1271), crying that his eyes "should see no more / Such horrors as he suffered and had caused" (1272-1273). Blinded Oedipus appears onstage, lamenting. He begs Creon to exile him and care for his daughters [Antigone](../heroes/antigone.md) and [Ismene](../heroes/ismene.md), who are brought to him. The Chorus concludes: "Therefore, look to the end, and count no mortal blest / Until he pass the goal of suffering without a tear" (1528-1530).
