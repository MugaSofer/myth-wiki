## Overview

The **Epic Cycle** is a collection of lost epic poems that together with the [Iliad](iliad.md) and Odyssey formed a complete narrative of the Trojan War and related myths. They survive only in summaries (mainly by Proclus) and quoted fragments. The Evelyn-White collection also includes fragments of the Theban Cycle.

## The Trojan Cycle

### Cypria (attributed to Stasinus)

**Scope:** From the origins of the war to the beginning of the [Iliad](iliad.md).

- [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) plans the Trojan War with [Themis](../deities/themis.md) to depopulate the earth: "Zeus saw it and had pity and in his wise heart resolved to relieve the all-nurturing earth of men by causing the great struggle of the Ilian war, that the load of death might empty the world."[^cyp-zeus]
- **The Judgment of Paris**: Strife arrives at the wedding of Peleus and [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md); [Hera](../deities/hera.md), [Athena](../deities/athena.md), and [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md) dispute which is fairest; [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md) leads them to Paris (Alexandrus) on Mount Ida; Paris chooses Aphrodite, who promises him Helen.[^cyp-judgment]
- **Thetis's marriage**: "Thetis, to please [Hera](../deities/hera.md), avoided union with [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md), at which he was enraged and swore that she should be the wife of a mortal."[^cyp-thetis] At the wedding, Cheiron gave Peleus an ash spear-shaft, [Athena](../deities/athena.md) polished it, and [Hephaestus](../deities/hephaestus.md) fitted it with a head.[^cyp-spear]
- **Helen's birth**: Helen was born of [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) and Nemesis, who "tried to escape him and liked not to lie in love with her father Zeus... for shame and indignation vexed her heart: therefore she fled him over the land and fruitless dark water." She took forms of fish and "dread creatures" to escape, but Zeus pursued.[^cyp-nemesis]
- **Aphrodite's garments**: "She clothed herself with garments which the [Graces](../deities/graces.md) and [Hours](../deities/horae.md) had made for her and dyed in flowers of spring — such flowers as the Seasons wear — in crocus and hyacinth and flourishing violet and the rose's lovely bloom."[^cyp-aphrodite]
- **Castor and Polydeuces**: While stealing cattle, Castor was killed by Idas; Polydeuces killed both Idas and Lynceus. "[Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) gave them immortality every other day."[^cyp-dioscuri]
- **Iphigeneia at Aulis**: Agamemnon shot a stag and boasted he surpassed [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md); "the goddess was so angry that she sent stormy winds and prevented them from sailing." They were told to sacrifice Iphigeneia, but [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md) "snatched her away and transported her to the Tauri, making her immortal, and putting a stag in place of the girl upon the altar."[^cyp-iphigeneia]
- **The death of Achilles foretold**: Paris and [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) will slay Achilles (consistent with [Iliad](iliad.md) XXII).
- **The Gorgons**: "By him she conceived and bare the Gorgons, fearful monsters who lived in Sarpedon, a rocky island in deep-eddying Oceanus."[^cyp-gorgons]

[^cyp-zeus]: "Zeus saw it and had pity and in his wise heart resolved to relieve the all-nurturing earth of men by causing the great struggle of the Ilian war, that the load of death might empty the world. And so the heroes were slain in Troy, and the plan of Zeus came to pass" (Cypria, Fragment 3)

[^cyp-aphrodite]: "She clothed herself with garments which the Graces and Hours had made for her and dyed in flowers of spring—such flowers as the Seasons wear—in crocus and hyacinth and flourishing violet and the rose's lovely bloom, so sweet and delicious, and heavenly buds, the flowers of the narcissus and lily" (Cypria, Fragment 6)
[^cyp-dioscuri]: Cypria, summary by Proclus: "Castor was killed by Idas, and Lynceus and Idas by Polydeuces. Zeus gave them immortality every other day"

[^cyp-gorgons]: "By him she conceived and bare the Gorgons, fearful monsters who lived in Sarpedon, a rocky island in deep-eddying Oceanus" (Cypria, Fragment 21)
