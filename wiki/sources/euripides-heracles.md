## Overview

The *Heracles* (also titled *Hercules Distracted* or *Heracles Mainomenos*) dramatises the most devastating episode in [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md)' life. While he is in the underworld fetching [Cerberus](../creatures/cerberus.md), the usurper Lycus seizes [Thebes](../places/thebes.md) and threatens to kill [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md)' wife Megara, their children, and his father [Amphitryon](../heroes/amphitryon.md). Heracles returns just in time to kill Lycus, but [Hera](../deities/hera.md) then sends [Iris](../deities/iris.md) and the goddess Lyssa (Madness) to drive him insane. In his frenzy Heracles kills Megara and all three of his sons. The play's final act shows [Theseus](../heroes/theseus.md) persuading Heracles not to commit suicide, and leading him to Athens.

The play is notable for Heracles' theological speech rejecting myths of divine immorality ("by some lying bard / Those miserable fables were devised"), his decision to endure life as an act of courage rather than die, and the portrait of friendship between Heracles and Theseus.

## Contents

### Prologue (1-106)

[Amphitryon](../heroes/amphitryon.md) explains the situation: Heracles descended to [Hades](../deities/hades.md) to fetch [Cerberus](../creatures/cerberus.md) as his final labour and has not returned. In his absence, Lycus has killed Creon and seized [Thebes](../places/thebes.md), and now threatens to kill Heracles' family.

### First Episode (107-347)

Megara resigns herself to death. Lycus mocks Heracles as merely an archer. Amphitryon delivers a passionate defence of archery as the wisest form of warfare.

### First Stasimon (348-435)

The Chorus catalogues Heracles' labours: the Nemean lion, the Centaurs, the golden hind, Diomedes' horses, Cycnus, the Hesperides, the Amazon belt, the Hydra, and Geryon.

### Second Episode (523-636)

Heracles returns from the underworld with [Cerberus](../creatures/cerberus.md). He reveals he also rescued [Theseus](../heroes/theseus.md) from Hades. He kills Lycus offstage.

### Third Stasimon (637-700)

The Chorus celebrates the restoration of justice. Meditation on youth and old age.

### Iris and Lyssa (815-874)

[Iris](../deities/iris.md) and the goddess Lyssa (Madness, daughter of [Night](../deities/night.md)) appear above the palace. Iris announces [Hera](../deities/hera.md)'s command. Lyssa reluctantly obeys, calling Heracles a benefactor of gods and men, but Iris insists.

### Messenger Speech (922-1015)

A messenger describes the murders. At the sacrificial altar, Heracles went suddenly still, then believed he was attacking [Eurystheus](../heroes/eurystheus.md) and his family. He killed his first son with an arrow, the second with his club, and the third alongside Megara with an arrow. [Athena](../deities/athena.md) intervened by hurling a rock at his chest, knocking him unconscious.

### Exodos (1089-1428)

Heracles awakens bound to a pillar. He discovers the bodies and learns the truth from Amphitryon. He contemplates suicide. [Theseus](../heroes/theseus.md) arrives and persuades him to endure life. Heracles rejects myths of divine immorality and departs for Athens with Theseus.
