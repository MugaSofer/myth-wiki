## Overview

**Trachiniae** is a tragedy by Sophocles named after its chorus of maidens from Trachis. The play dramatises the final destruction of [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) through the poisoned robe given to him unwittingly by his wife [Deianira](../heroes/deianira.md). The centaur [Nessus](../creatures/centaurs.md), dying from Heracles' arrow, had told Deianira to keep his blood as a love-charm. When Heracles sends home [Iole](../heroes/iole.md), the captive princess of Oechalia, Deianira smears a robe with the blood to reclaim his affection — but the blood, poisoned by the [Hydra](../creatures/hydra.md)'s venom, destroys Heracles.

The action takes place before Heracles' temporary home in Trachis. Deianira dominates the first half, Heracles the second.

## Contents

### Prologue (Deianira)

[Deianira](../heroes/deianira.md) recalls her early life: the river-god Achelous courted her "in three forms" — bull, serpent, and man with bovine front — until [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) came and defeated him. Since then she has lived in constant anxiety for her husband, who is always being sent on new labours. He has now been away fifteen months, leaving behind a scroll prophesying that either he will die at this task or live in peace thereafter. This oracle came from the oak of Zeus at Dodona.

### Lichas and the Captives

A messenger announces Heracles' victory at Oechalia. The herald Lichas arrives with captive women, including the silent [Iole](../heroes/iole.md). He tells a false story: Heracles was enslaved to Omphale in Lydia as punishment for killing Iphitus, and subsequently sacked Oechalia in revenge against Eurytus.

The messenger contradicts Lichas, revealing that Lichas had publicly said Heracles sacked Oechalia solely for love of Iole. Confronted, Lichas admits the truth. Deianira responds with remarkable composure: "Love leads even Immortals at his will, and me. Then how not others, like to me?" She does not blame Heracles.

### The Robe of Nessus

Privately, Deianira reveals her plan. She has kept the blood of the centaur [Nessus](../creatures/centaurs.md), who had ferried her across the river Evenus and attempted to violate her. Heracles shot him, and the dying centaur told her to collect his blood as a love-charm. She has smeared a robe with it and sends it to Heracles via Lichas.

But then she notices the tuft of wool she used to apply the blood: exposed to sunlight, it has dissolved into foam and dust. She realises with horror that the centaur's "charm" was poison: "wherefore should the Centaur, for what end, show kindness to the cause for whom he died?"

### Hyllus's Report

[Hyllus](../heroes/hyllus.md) returns and accuses his mother of murder. He describes the scene at Cape Cenaeum: Heracles put on the robe at sacrifice, and when the flames warmed it, "close to every limb clung, like stone-drapery from the craftsman's hand, the garment, glued unto his side." In agony, Heracles seized the herald Lichas by the ankle and hurled him onto a sea-reef, dashing out his brains. Convulsed and screaming, he begged Hyllus to carry him away.

### Deianira's Suicide

The nurse reports that Deianira, hearing Hyllus's accusation, went silently through the house, touching familiar objects and weeping. She sat on the marriage bed, crying "Farewell, my bridal bed, for never more shalt thou give me the comfort I have known thee give." Then she stabbed herself with a sword. Hyllus, learning too late that his mother had acted innocently from the centaur's deceit, wept over her body.

### Heracles' Agony and Final Commands

Heracles is carried in on a litter, raving in pain. He catalogues the labours conquered by his mighty arms — the Nemean lion, the [Hydra](../creatures/hydra.md), the [centaurs](../creatures/centaurs.md), the Erymanthian boar, [Cerberus](../creatures/cerberus.md), the dragon guarding golden apples — and laments that "a soft woman without manhood's strain alone and weaponless hath conquered me."

When Hyllus tells him of Nessus and Deianira's innocence, Heracles recognises the fulfilment of two prophecies: his father [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) had foretold he would die "by none who lived and breathed, but from the will of one now dwelling in the house of death" — the dead centaur. And the oak at Dodona had prophesied that his labours would end at this time — which he had taken to mean rest, but which meant death.

He commands Hyllus to carry him to Mount Oeta and burn him on a pyre of oak and wild olive, without tears. He also commands Hyllus to marry Iole — a demand Hyllus finds repugnant but obeys under his father's curse. The play ends as Heracles is carried toward the pyre.
