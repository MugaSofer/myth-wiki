## Overview

**Electra** is a tragedy by Sophocles treating the same myth as Aeschylus's [Libation-Bearers](aeschylus-libation-bearers.md) and Euripides' [Electra](euripides-electra.md) — the return of [Orestes](../heroes/orestes.md) to Mycenae to avenge his father [Agamemnon](../heroes/agamemnon.md)'s murder by [Clytemnestra](../heroes/clytemnestra.md) and [Aegisthus](../heroes/aegisthus.md). Sophocles' version centres the drama firmly on Electra's suffering, endurance, and moral force, making her the emotional core of the play.

A key structural difference from Aeschylus: the matricide occurs first, with Aegisthus killed second. The play ends without the arrival of the [Erinyes](../creatures/erinyes.md), leaving Orestes triumphant rather than pursued.

## Contents

### Prologue (Orestes, Old Man, Pylades)

[Orestes](../heroes/orestes.md) returns to Mycenae with his old tutor (the man who saved him as a child) and his friend [Pylades](../heroes/pylades.md), who does not speak. Orestes reveals [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md)'s oracle commanding vengeance: "No shielded host, but thine own craft, O King! The righteous death-blow to thine arm shall bring." The tutor will enter the palace claiming to be a Phocian messenger with news of Orestes' death; Orestes will follow with an urn supposedly containing his ashes. They hear Electra's cry from within.

### Electra's Monody and Parodos

[Electra](../heroes/electra.md) emerges, lamenting her father's murder in an extended lyric. She invokes [Hades](../deities/hades.md), [Persephone](../deities/persephone.md), [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md), the Curse, and the [Erinyes](../creatures/erinyes.md), asking them to send Orestes to avenge their father. The chorus of Argive women urges moderation, but Electra refuses to cease mourning.

### Electra's Condition

Electra describes her life under Clytemnestra and Aegisthus: she is kept like a slave in her own father's house, "thus meanly attired, and starved, a table-serving thrall." She watches Aegisthus sit on Agamemnon's throne, wear his robes, and share Clytemnestra's bed. Clytemnestra celebrates the monthly anniversary of the murder with feasting and sacrifice. Electra lives only for the hope of Orestes' return.

### Chrysothemis

[Chrysothemis](../heroes/chrysothemis.md), Electra's sister, enters. She sympathises with Electra but has chosen submission over resistance: "in misfortune I have chosen to sail with lowered canvas." She warns that Aegisthus plans to entomb Electra in a rock-hewn chamber if she continues mourning. She also reports that Clytemnestra has been frightened by a dream: Agamemnon's spirit returned, planted his sceptre on the hearth, and from it a shoot grew that "shadowed all the ground of loved Mycenae." Clytemnestra has sent Chrysothemis with offerings to Agamemnon's tomb. Electra persuades her to replace them with their own offerings — locks of hair and Electra's girdle — and pray for Orestes' return.

### Clytemnestra vs. Electra

[Clytemnestra](../heroes/clytemnestra.md) confronts Electra. She justifies killing Agamemnon: he sacrificed [Iphigenia](../heroes/iphigenia.md) to [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md) for the sake of Menelaus's war. Electra retorts that Agamemnon acted under compulsion from the goddess, and that Clytemnestra's true motive was Aegisthus: "Tell me, I pray, what cause thou dost uphold in doing now the basest deed of all, chambered with the blood-guilty." She warns that if blood for blood is law, Clytemnestra should be the next to die.

Clytemnestra prays to [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) for protection and release from her fears.

### The False Report of Orestes' Death

The tutor enters claiming to be a messenger from Phanoteus of Phocis, and delivers an elaborate false narrative of Orestes' death in a chariot race at the Pythian games. Orestes dominated every event but was killed when his chariot struck the turning-post, the axle shattered, and he was dragged by the reins. His ashes are in a bronze urn.

Clytemnestra receives the news with mixed emotions: "To be a mother hath a marvellous power: no injury can make one hate one's child." But she is ultimately relieved: the threat to her life is gone. Electra is devastated.

### Electra's Resolve

Believing Orestes dead, Electra determines to kill Aegisthus herself, alone. She urges Chrysothemis to join her, but Chrysothemis refuses. Electra declares she will act alone: "I, all alone and with a single hand, must do this."

### The Recognition

Orestes arrives carrying the urn, still disguised. Electra asks to hold it and delivers a famous lament over what she believes are her brother's ashes: "How cold in this thy welcome is the hope wherein I decked thee as I sent thee forth!" She recalls how she nursed him, was called "sister, sister" by him. She begs to be taken into the urn: "receive me to thyself, hide me in this thy covering, there to dwell, me who am nothing, with thy nothingness, for ever!"

Orestes, overcome, reveals himself. He shows his father's signet ring as proof. Electra's joy is ecstatic: "Have my arms caught thee?" — "Hold me so for aye!"

### The Revenge

Orestes and Pylades enter the palace. Clytemnestra's cries are heard from within: "O son, have pity! Pity the womb that bare thee." Electra, standing at the door, responds: "Thou hadst none for him, nor for his father, in that day." When Clytemnestra cries "Oh, I am smitten!", Electra calls out: "Give a second stroke, if thou hast power."

Orestes emerges with bloodied hands. Aegisthus then arrives, expecting to view Orestes' body, but discovers Clytemnestra's corpse instead. Orestes forces him to the spot where Agamemnon was killed and takes him inside to die. The chorus declares: "O seed of Atreus! how triumphantly through grief and hardness thou hast freedom found."
