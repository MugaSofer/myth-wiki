## Overview

The **Fabulae** (or **Fables**) is a Latin collection of approximately 277 mythological narratives and genealogical lists, traditionally attributed to Gaius Julius Hyginus, a freedman of Augustus and director of the Palatine Library. The poor quality of the surviving text suggests it is either wrongly attributed or a later abridgement by a 2nd-century grammarian.

Despite its often corrupt text and compressed style, the Fabulae preserves many myths and variant traditions not found elsewhere. It is particularly valuable for its systematic catalogue entries (lists of Argonauts, suitors, labours, etc.) and for preserving plot summaries of lost Greek tragedies.

## Structure

- **Preface**: Cosmogonic genealogy from Mist and Chaos through the Olympians
- **Fabulae 1-49**: Athamas/Ino cycle, Argonauts, Trojan War preliminaries, Theban cycle
