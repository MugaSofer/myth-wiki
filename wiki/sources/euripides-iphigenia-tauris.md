## Overview

*Iphigenia in Tauris* dramatizes the reunion of [Iphigenia](../heroes/iphigenia.md) and [Orestes](../heroes/orestes.md) in the land of the Taurians, where Iphigenia serves as priestess of [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md), preparing Greek strangers for sacrifice. Orestes, still pursued by the Erinyes after killing [Clytemnestra](../heroes/clytemnestra.md), has been commanded by [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) to steal Artemis's sacred image from Tauris and bring it to Athens. The siblings recognize each other, devise a plan to escape with the image, and are ultimately rescued by [Athena](../deities/athena.md)'s intervention.

## Contents

### 1. Prologue: Iphigenia in Exile (lines ~1-66)
Iphigenia traces her genealogy (Pelops → Atreus → [Agamemnon](../heroes/agamemnon.md)) and recounts her sacrifice at Aulis, where "Diana, giving to the Greeks a stag in my stead, stole me away, and, sending me through the clear ether, she settled me in this land of the Tauri." She now serves as priestess, performing the ritual preparation of Greek strangers for sacrifice. A dream has convinced her that Orestes is dead — a single pillar of her father's house, streaming with golden hair and receiving a human voice, which she interprets as his death.

### 2. Orestes and Pylades Arrive (lines ~67-235)
Orestes and Pylades arrive, sent by Apollo's oracle. Orestes complains that Apollo "has driven me as far as possible from Greece, in shame of his former prophecies." He must steal the heaven-sent image to gain respite from madness. A herdsman reports their capture: Orestes suffered a fit of madness on the shore, seeing Furies — "Pylades, dost thou behold this? Dost not behold this snake of Hades, how she would fain slay me, armed against me with horrid vipers?" He attacked the cattle, believing them to be Furies. The pair fought bravely but were overwhelmed.

### 3. Iphigenia's Theological Critique (lines ~236-390)
Iphigenia delivers a remarkable speech questioning Artemis's character: the goddess deems anyone who touches a corpse impure, "but yet herself takes pleasure in man-slaying sacrifices. It can not be that the consort of Jove, Latona, hath brought forth so much ignorance." She attributes the practice to local barbarian custom, not divine will: "I deem that those in this land, being themselves man-slayers, charge the Goddess with their own baseness, for I think not that any one of the Gods is bad."

### 4. The Recognition (lines ~391-680)
Iphigenia questions the stranger (Orestes, unnamed) about Greece: she learns Troy has fallen, Helen has returned to Sparta, Calchas died at Mycenae, [Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md) has not returned, [Achilles](../heroes/achilles.md) is dead ("In vain he held his wedding in Aulis"), Agamemnon was killed by his wife, and his son killed her in return. She offers to spare one stranger to carry a letter to Argos. The letter is addressed to Orestes — and Pylades delivers it directly to him. Orestes proves his identity by recalling the tapestry of the golden lamb and the sun's reversal, and "the ancient spear of Pelops in my father's house, which brandishing in his hand, he won Hippodameia, having slain Oenomaus."

### 5. The Escape and Athena's Intervention (lines ~681-end)
Iphigenia devises a ruse: she tells King Thoas the strangers are polluted with matricide and the image must be purified in the sea. At the shore, Orestes carries her and the image aboard his ship. A storm drives the ship back toward shore, but Athena appears as deus ex machina. She commands Thoas to let them go, reveals that [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) "has already, for my sake, rendered the surface of the sea waveless," and establishes cult regulations: the image shall be enshrined at Halae in Attica ("named after the Tauric land"); at its festival, "let them apply the sword to the neck of a man, and let blood flow on account of the holy Goddess." Iphigenia is commanded to be "guardian of the temple of this Goddess at the hallowed ascent of Brauron; where also thou shalt be buried at thy death."

## Key Mythological Content

### Iphigenia's Critique of Artemis
Iphigenia's theological argument that the gods cannot truly desire human sacrifice is striking: she believes the Taurians "being themselves man-slayers, charge the Goddess with their own baseness, for I think not that any one of the Gods is bad." She extends this rationalism to Tantalus's banquet: "I even disbelieve the banquets of Tantalus set before the Gods, as that they should be pleased with feeding on a boy."

### Orestes' Trial at Athens
Orestes recounts his trial at the Areopagus: "I indeed occupying one seat, but the eldest of the Erinnyes the other, having spoken and heard respecting my mother's death, Phoebus saved me by bearing witness, but Pallas counted out for me the equal votes with her hand, and I came off victor in the bloody trial." He explains that the Choes festival at Athens originated from his quarantine: Athenians served him separately, and "my misfortunes have been made a festival at Athens."

### The Cult Foundations
Athena establishes two cult sites: (1) At Halae near Athens, the image shall be enshrined and a ritual of drawing blood from a man's neck performed at its festival; (2) At Brauron, Iphigenia shall serve as temple guardian and be buried there, with "rich woven vestments, which women, dying in childbed, may leave in their houses" offered to her.

### Apollo and the Delphic Oracle
The Chorus sings of Apollo's conquest of the Delphic oracle: as an infant he slew the Python and displaced [Themis](../deities/themis.md) from the prophetic seat. Earth retaliated by sending dream-oracles to mortals. Apollo appealed to [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md), who "laughed, because his son had come quickly to him, wishing to obtain the wealthy office, and he shook his hair, and put an end to the nightly dreams," restoring Apollo's oracular monopoly.

### Pelops's Spear
Among the proofs of Orestes' identity is "the ancient spear of Pelops in my father's house, which brandishing in his hand, he won Hippodameia, having slain Oenomaus" — kept hidden in Iphigenia's virgin chamber.
