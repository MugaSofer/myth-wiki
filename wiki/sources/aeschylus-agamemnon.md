## Overview

The *Agamemnon* is the first play of Aeschylus's Oresteia trilogy, which won first prize at the Dionysia in 458 BCE. It dramatizes the return of King [Agamemnon](../heroes/agamemnon.md) from the [Trojan War](../events/trojan-war.md) and his murder at the hands of his wife [Clytemnestra](../heroes/clytemnestra.md), aided by her lover [Aegisthus](../heroes/aegisthus.md). The play explores themes of justice, vengeance, the curse on the house of [Atreus](../heroes/atreus.md), and the moral consequences of the sacrifice of [Iphigenia](../heroes/iphigenia.md).

## Contents

### Watchman's Prologue (~1-39)
A watchman on the palace roof at [Argos](../places/argos.md) has kept vigil for a year awaiting the beacon signal that [Troy](../places/troy.md) has fallen. He sees the fire and rejoices, but hints darkly at troubles within the house.

### Parodos: Chorus of Argive Elders (~40-257)
The Chorus recounts the expedition against Troy, the omen of two eagles devouring a pregnant hare (interpreted by [Calchas](../heroes/calchas.md) as foretelling Troy's fall but provoking [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md)' wrath), and the sacrifice of [Iphigenia](../heroes/iphigenia.md) at Aulis. They sing the famous hymn to [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md): "Men shall learn wisdom, by affliction schooled."

### First Episode (~258-354)
[Clytemnestra](../heroes/clytemnestra.md) describes the relay of beacon fires from Troy to Argos and imagines the scenes of victory and plunder at Troy.

### First Stasimon (~355-488)
The Chorus meditates on [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md)' justice and the cost of the war, reflecting on [Helen](../heroes/helen.md)'s departure and the grief of those who sent men to die for another's wife.

### Second Episode (~489-680)
A Herald arrives confirming Troy's fall, describing the army's sufferings. He reports that [Menelaus](../heroes/menelaus.md)' ship was lost in a storm and his fate is unknown.

### Second Stasimon (~681-782)
The Chorus tells the parable of the lion cub raised in a household, at first gentle but growing to reveal its savage nature—a metaphor for [Helen](../heroes/helen.md) at Troy.

### Third Episode (~783-974)
[Agamemnon](../heroes/agamemnon.md) arrives in a chariot with [Cassandra](../heroes/cassandra.md) as his war-prize. Clytemnestra greets him with an elaborate speech and lays out purple tapestries for him to walk upon. Despite misgivings about the hubris of treading on such finery, Agamemnon yields and enters the palace.

### Third Stasimon (~975-1034)
The Chorus sings of nameless foreboding and dread.

### Fourth Episode: Cassandra Scene (~1035-1330)
[Cassandra](../heroes/cassandra.md), cursed by [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) so that her prophecies are never believed, reveals in a visionary frenzy the history of the house—[Thyestes](../heroes/thyestes.md)' children served as food by [Atreus](../heroes/atreus.md)—and foresees Agamemnon's murder and her own death. She enters the palace knowingly going to her doom.

### Fifth Episode (~1331-1576)
Agamemnon's death-cries are heard from within. Clytemnestra emerges, blood-spattered, and reveals the bodies. She describes how she trapped him in a robe-net and struck him three times. She justifies the murder as vengeance for Iphigenia and claims to be an instrument of the ancient curse.

### Exodos (~1577-1673)
[Aegisthus](../heroes/aegisthus.md) enters and exults over the corpse, telling how his father [Thyestes](../heroes/thyestes.md) was tricked by [Atreus](../heroes/atreus.md) into eating his own children, and how this murder is his rightful vengeance. The Chorus defies Aegisthus and places hope in [Orestes](../heroes/orestes.md)' return. Clytemnestra ends the play asserting that she and Aegisthus will rule together.
