## Overview

The *Argonautica* is an epic poem by Apollonius of Rhodes telling the story of [Jason](../heroes/jason.md) and the crew of the Argo sailing to Colchis at the eastern end of the Black Sea to retrieve the [Golden Fleece](../objects/golden-fleece.md). It is the only surviving Hellenistic epic and the most detailed ancient account of the Argonaut myth. The first two books describe the outward voyage, the third centres on [Medea](../heroes/medea.md)'s love for Jason, and the fourth covers the trials at Colchis and the return voyage.

The poem draws on earlier traditions including [Pindar](pindar.md)'s Pythian IV, but greatly expands the narrative with local legends, geographical detail, and an extended psychological portrayal of Medea that anticipates Virgil's [Dido](../heroes/dido.md).

## Contents

### Book I: The Outward Voyage Begins

Invocation to [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md). Pelias received an oracle to beware the one-sandalled man; [Jason](../heroes/jason.md) lost a sandal crossing the river Anaurus. **Catalogue of the Argonauts** (~50 heroes with parentage and abilities): [Orpheus](../heroes/orpheus.md) (son of [Calliope](../deities/muses.md) and Oeagrus, charmed rocks and rivers with song), Polyphemus the Lapith, [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) (carrying the Erymanthian boar), [Castor and Polydeuces](../heroes/dioscuri.md), [Peleus](../heroes/peleus.md) and Telamon (exiled for killing Phocus), Idas and Lynceus (Lynceus could see beneath the earth), Periclymenus (shape-shifting from [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md)), Euphemus (son of Poseidon, could run on water), Meleager, Zetes and Calais (winged sons of [Boreas](../deities/boreas.md)), Tiphys (helmsman, urged by [Athena](../deities/athena.md)), Argus (built the ship with Athena's counsel), Idmon (true son of Apollo, foresaw his own death), and many others. The [Argo](../objects/argo.md) built by Argus with Athena; beam of Dodonian oak fitted in the stem.

Jason's farewell to his mother Alcimede. Departure compared to [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md). [Chiron](../creatures/chiron.md) comes to shore with infant [Achilles](../heroes/achilles.md) to show him to [Peleus](../heroes/peleus.md). Orpheus sings a cosmogony: Ophion and Eurynome held [Olympus](../places/olympus.md) before [Cronos](../deities/cronos.md) and [Rhea](../deities/rhea.md); [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) as child in the Dictaean cave; [Cyclopes](../creatures/cyclopes.md) not yet having armed him.

**Lemnos episode**: The women killed all men ([Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md)'s wrath for dishonoring her); Hypsipyle spared her father Thoas; Argonauts stayed and consorted with the women; Heracles rebuked them to leave.

**Cyzicus episode**: Welcomed by King Cyzicus of the Doliones; Heracles killed the six-armed Earthborn monsters; tragic night-battle where the Argonauts accidentally killed Cyzicus and his people; Cleite hanged herself and nymphs made a fountain from her tears; twelve-day storm; ritual to [Rhea](../deities/rhea.md)/Cybele on Mt Dindymum.

**Hylas episode**: At Mysia, Hylas was taken by a water-nymph at a spring; [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) searched frantically; the Argo sailed without them at dawn. Glaucus rose from the sea and explained: Heracles must complete labours for Eurystheus, Polyphemus must found a city at Cius, Hylas was taken by a nymph as husband. Telamon accused Jason of treachery; Jason graciously accepted his apology.

### Book II: The Voyage to Colchis

**Amycus and Polydeuces**: At the land of the Bebrycians, Amycus (son of [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) and nymph Bithynian Melie) forced all strangers to box. Polydeuces accepted the challenge, and killed him with a blow above the ear. Battle followed; the Bebrycians were routed.

**Phineus and the [Harpies](../creatures/harpies.md)**: Phineus, son of Agenor, was a blind prophet punished by [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) for revealing the divine will too completely. The Harpies snatched his food and left a loathsome stench. Zetes and Calais chased them away; [Iris](../deities/iris.md) intervened, swearing the Harpies would never return. Phineus prophesied the Argonauts' route: the Clashing Rocks (Symplegades), the coasts of the Black Sea — Mariandyni, Amazons, Chalybes (ironworkers), Tibareni (couvade custom), Mossynoeci (inverted customs), the island of [Ares](../deities/ares.md), and finally Colchis. He urged them to trust in "the artful aid of the Cyprian goddess" ([Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md)).

**Digression on Aristaeus**: Son of [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) and Cyrene. Apollo carried Cyrene from the river Peneus to Libya. Aristaeus raised by [Chiron](../creatures/chiron.md), taught by the [Muses](../deities/muses.md). Summoned to Ceos to end a pestilence from Sirius; sacrificed to Zeus Icmaeus — origin of the Etesian winds.

**The Symplegades**: Euphemus released a dove between the clashing rocks; it passed through, losing only its tail feathers. [Athena](../deities/athena.md) physically pushed the Argo through with her hands, shearing off the stern ornament. The rocks then became fixed forever. Tiphys credited Athena for the ship's divine strength.

**Jason's despair and rallying**: Jason confessed he constantly fears for his comrades and groans through every night; the crew cheered him and his courage returned.

**Deaths of Idmon and Tiphys**: Idmon (the seer) was killed by a white-tusked boar; Peleus and Idas killed the boar. Tiphys died of illness. Ancaeus (son of Poseidon and Astypalaea) took over as helmsman.

**Apollo's epiphany at Thynias**: Apollo appeared passing from Lycia to the Hyperboreans — golden locks, silver bow, quiver; the island quaked; none could look at his face. Orpheus named the island "sacred isle of Apollo of the Dawn" and sang of Apollo slaying Delphyne at [Parnassus](../places/delphi.md). Temple to Concord built.

**Ghost of Sthenelus**: Sthenelus, comrade of Heracles, killed by an Amazon arrow; his ghost rose from his barrow to gaze at the ship. Orpheus dedicated his lyre at the tomb — place named Lyra.

**Sinope**: [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) promised her anything she desired; she asked for virginity. She deceived Apollo and the river Halys the same way.

**The Amazons**: Three tribes — Themiscyreians (under Hippolyte), Lycastians, dart-throwing Chadesians. Daughters of Ares and nymph Harmonia. Heracles captured Melanippe; Hippolyte gave her girdle as ransom.

**Island of Ares**: Birds shot feather-shafts. Amphidamas recalled Heracles at the Stymphalian lake and devised a shield-wall defense. **Sons of Phrixus** (Argus, Cytissorus, Phrontis, Melas) shipwrecked; rescued by the Argonauts; they are Jason's kinsmen (Cretheus and Athamas were brothers). Temple of Ares on the island — black stone altar where Amazons sacrificed horses.

**Philyra island**: [Cronos](../deities/cronos.md) lay with Philyra, deceiving [Rhea](../deities/rhea.md); caught in the act, he leapt up as a horse. Philyra bore [Chiron](../creatures/chiron.md), "half like a horse, half like a god."

**[Prometheus](../deities/prometheus.md) on the Caucasus**: Bound by bronze fetters on the rocks. The eagle that fed on his liver flew over the ship; they heard his screams.

**Arrival at Colchis**: They entered the river Phasis and saw the city of Aea, the plain of Ares, and the sacred grove where the serpent guarded the fleece on an oak.

### Book III: Medea's Love

Invocation to Erato. [Hera](../deities/hera.md) and [Athena](../deities/athena.md) conspired to help Jason; they went to [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md) and asked her to send [Eros](../deities/eros.md) to make [Medea](../heroes/medea.md) fall in love with Jason. Aphrodite found Eros playing dice with [Ganymede](../deities/zeus.md) in Zeus's orchard, cheating and winning. She bribed him with Zeus's golden ball (made by his nurse Adrasteia in the Idaean cave).

**Aeetes' palace**: Four magical fountains ([Hephaestus](../deities/hephaestus.md)'s work) gushing milk, wine, oil, and water. Bronze-footed fire-breathing bulls (Hephaestus made them for Aeetes in thanks to [Helius](../deities/helius.md)). Aeetes described as son of Helius; rode in chariot to visit his sister [Circe](../deities/circe.md) in the west. His son Apsyrtus (also called Phaethon) was by a Caucasian nymph Asterodeia; his queen was Eidyia, youngest daughter of [Tethys](../deities/tethys.md) and [Oceanus](../deities/oceanus.md). Two daughters: Chalciope and Medea. Medea was priestess of [Hecate](../deities/hecate.md).

**Colchian customs**: Dead men were not buried or burned but wrapped in untanned oxhides and suspended from trees; women were buried in earth.

Eros shot Medea; the bolt "burnt deep down in the maiden's heart like a flame." Aeetes set Jason's task: yoke two bronze-footed fire-breathing bulls, plough four plough-gates of the field of Ares, sow dragon's teeth, and slay the armed men that spring up — all in one day. Jason accepted despite despair. Telamon's anger was checked by Jason.

**Medea's inner conflict**: Extended psychological portrait. She debated helping Jason vs. loyalty to her father through the night, considered suicide with poison ("she brought a casket wherein lay many drugs, some for healing, others for killing"), but was turned back by "a deadly fear of hateful Hades" and "all the delightful things that are among the living." [Hera](../deities/hera.md) strengthened her resolve.

**The charm of Prometheus**: A plant that sprang from the blood-like ichor that dripped from Prometheus's wound when the eagle fed. "Its flower appeared a cubit above ground in colour like the Corycian crocus, rising on twin stalks; but in the earth the root was like newly-cut flesh." Medea had gathered it after bathing in seven streams and calling seven times on Brimo ([Hecate](../deities/hecate.md)), "night-wandering Brimo, of the underworld, queen among the dead."

**Meeting at the temple of Hecate**: Jason compared to [Sirius](../deities/apollo.md); Medea's heart stopped at the sight of him. Jason invoked the precedent of [Ariadne](../heroes/ariadne.md) helping [Theseus](../heroes/theseus.md), and Medea asked about Ariadne (her kinswoman through [Pasiphae](../heroes/minos.md), sister of Aeetes). She gave him the charm and instructions for propitiating Hecate. They exchanged promises. Jason told her of his homeland Haemonia (Thessaly) and how Prometheus's son Deucalion founded cities there. The dragon's teeth were originally from the Aonian dragon which [Cadmus](../heroes/cadmus.md) slew at Theban Ares' spring; Athena (Tritonian goddess) gave half to Aeetes and half to Cadmus.

**Jason's trial**: He sacrificed to [Hecate](../deities/hecate.md) at midnight; the goddess came "from the uttermost depths" with serpents, torches, and the howling hounds of hell. The charm made Jason invulnerable — his comrades could not bend his spear; Idas hacked at it with a sword and the blade bounced off. Jason yoked the fire-breathing bulls, ploughed four plough-gates, sowed the teeth, threw a massive stone among the springing warriors (as Medea instructed), and they killed each other; he slew the rest. Aeetes retreated, planning treachery.

### Book IV: The Fleece and the Return

Invocation to the Muse. Medea, fearing discovery, nearly poisoned herself again but Hera stopped her. She fled to the Argo, leaving a lock of hair for her mother. Bolts opened at her magic song. She promised to lull the guardian serpent.

**Winning the fleece**: Jason and Medea went to the sacred grove. The serpent hissed so loud it woke mothers far across the Colchian land. Medea sang it to sleep and sprinkled its eyes with juniper and "untempered charms." Jason snatched the fleece from the oak; "from the shimmering of the flocks of wool there settled on his fair cheeks and brow a red flush like a flame." The fleece was "great as is the hide of a yearling ox" and "heavy, thickly clustered with flocks."

**Pursuit and murder of Apsyrtus**: Aeetes sent the Colchian fleet. The Argonauts fled up the Ister (Danube). Apsyrtus led one group of Colchians and cut them off. A truce was proposed — the fleece was justly won, but Medea's fate would be judged by a king. Medea furiously reminded Jason of his oaths. She then proposed luring Apsyrtus: "I will beguile Apsyrtus to come into thy hands... slay him." Jason ambushed and killed Apsyrtus at a temple of [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md) on the Brygean isles; he "cut off the extremities of the dead man, and thrice licked up some blood and thrice spat the pollution from his teeth, as it is right for the slayer to do, to atone for a treacherous murder." The Fury beheld the deed.

**The speaking ship and Circe's purification**: [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) ordained purification by [Circe](../deities/circe.md). The beam of Dodonian oak spoke with human voice, telling them to seek Circe. They sailed the Eridanus (where [Phaethon](../heroes/phaethon.md) fell — the daughters of [Helius](../deities/helius.md) wept amber tears), the Rhodanus, past the Stoechades, to Aeaea. Circe bathed in the sea, surrounded by her monstrous beasts. She purified them with the blood of a young sow, atonement-cakes, and prayers to Zeus the Cleanser and the [Furies](../creatures/erinyes.md). She recognized Medea as kin by the far-flashing of their eyes (mark of Helius's race). She condemned Medea: "an evil and shameful return hast thou planned," but honored the suppliant bond and sent them away.

**Hera's plan for the return**: [Hera](../deities/hera.md) sent [Iris](../deities/iris.md) to summon [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md) from the sea, to still [Hephaestus](../deities/hephaestus.md)'s fires, and to bid [Aeolus](../deities/aeolus.md) calm all winds except the west. Hera revealed to Thetis that [Achilles](../heroes/achilles.md) was destined to wed Medea in the Elysian fields. Thetis's backstory: she refused Zeus's bed; Themis prophesied she would bear a son mightier than his sire; Zeus gave her to Peleus. Thetis tried to make infant Achilles immortal by fire and ambrosia, but Peleus interrupted; she left in fury and never returned.

**[Sirens](../creatures/sirens.md)**: Daughters of [Achelous](../deities/achelous.md) and [Terpsichore](../deities/muses.md) (a Muse); once attendants of [Persephone](../deities/persephone.md) ("tended Demeter's noble daughter still unwed"); "fashioned in part like birds and in part like maidens." [Orpheus](../heroes/orpheus.md) drowned out their song with his lyre; only Butes leapt overboard, rescued by Aphrodite.

**Scylla and the Wandering Rocks**: Scylla called daughter of Hecate (who is called Crataeis) and Phorcys. The Nereids lifted and passed the Argo through the Wandering Rocks like maidens tossing a ball.

**Phaeacia and the marriage**: At Drepane (Corcyra), the Colchians demanded Medea. [Alcinous](../heroes/odysseus.md) judged: if she were a maid, return her to her father; if she shared a husband's bed, she stays with Jason. Arete warned Jason through a herald. They married in the sacred cave of Macris (nurse of [Dionysus](../deities/dionysus.md)), with the Golden Fleece spread on the bridal couch; nymphs gathered flowers.

**Libya**: Swept to the Syrtis; the heroes nearly died of despair in the desert. Libyan heroine-nymphs appeared and gave a riddle: "when Amphitrite has loosed Poseidon's car, pay your mother recompense for her travail." A horse leapt from the sea; Peleus interpreted: their "mother" was the ship — they carried the Argo overland for twelve days. They found the garden of the [Hesperides](../deities/atlas.md) where Heracles had killed the serpent Ladon the previous day, and the Hesperides turned into trees (Hespere a poplar, Eretheis an elm, Aegle a willow). Heracles had struck a rock to make a spring. Canthus was killed by Caphaurus (grandson of Apollo). Mopsus died from a serpent bite — one of the serpents born from the blood of the Gorgon's head when [Perseus](../heroes/perseus.md) flew over Libya.

**Lake Tritonis**: Triton, son of [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md), appeared in the form of a youth and gave Euphemus a clod of earth. He guided the Argo to the sea; his body was human above and fish-tailed below.

**Talos on Crete**: Talos, man of bronze, "of the stock of bronze, of the men sprung from ash-trees, the last left among the sons of the gods." [Cronos](../deities/cronos.md) gave him to Europa. He strode round Crete three times daily. Invulnerable except for a blood-red vein beneath the sinew by his ankle. Medea bewitched him with songs and invocations of the Death-spirits; he grazed his ankle on a crag, the ichor gushed out, and he fell like a half-hewn pine.

**Darkness and Anaphe**: Total darkness engulfed them; Jason prayed to Apollo, who appeared with his golden bow on the Melantian rocks, revealing the isle of Anaphe. Medea's handmaids mocked the heroes during a makeshift sacrifice — origin of ritual jesting.

**Euphemus's dream and Thera**: Euphemus dreamed the clod from Triton became an island; Jason interpreted it as a prophecy — his descendants would inhabit it. Euphemus cast the clod into the sea; it became Calliste (later Thera). The Argonauts reached Aegina, then sailed home to Pagasae.
