## Overview

The *Helen* is Euripides' most sustained exploration of the phantom Helen tradition — the claim that the real Helen never went to Troy, but was replaced by a phantom made of ether while the real Helen waited in Egypt. Built on a premise attributed to the lyric poet Stesichorus, the play uses it to question the meaning of war, identity, and divine justice. It is sometimes classified as a "romance" or "escape tragedy" rather than a conventional tragedy, since it ends in the reunited couple's escape and the promise of Helen's deification.

The play is set at the tomb of Proteus in Egypt. Proteus is dead; his son Theoclymenus, who kills any Greek he finds, pursues Helen for marriage. The couple must deceive Theoclymenus and secure the help of Proteus's prophetic daughter Theonoe to escape.

## Contents

### Prologue (Helen's monologue)
Helen establishes the setting and the phantom tradition. She identifies herself as the daughter of Tyndareus and Leda, born from Zeus in the form of a swan. Three goddesses came to Paris on Ida; Aphrodite promised Helen and won the beauty contest; but Hera, enraged at her defeat, gave Paris not Helen herself but "in my semblance formed a living image composed of ether." Zeus added to the misery by bringing war on Greece and Troy to lighten the overpopulated earth. Hermes carried the real Helen to Egypt, to the house of Proteus. Now Proteus is dead and his son Theoclymenus presses her to marry him; she clings to Proteus's tomb as a suppliant.

### Teucer scene
Teucer arrives, banished by his father Telamon for returning from Troy without Ajax. He mistakes Helen for the infamous woman and nearly stones her. He brings devastating news: Troy has fallen; Menelaus and Helen are rumoured dead at sea; Leda has hanged herself from shame; Castor and Pollux are said to be either dead by suicide or transformed into stars. Teucer seeks the prophetess Theonoe for guidance to Cyprus, where Apollo has told him to found a new Salamis. Helen warns him to flee before Theoclymenus finds him.

### Parodos (Choral entry)
Helen laments. She invokes the Sirens ("ye syrens, winged daughters of the earth") to aid her grief. The Chorus of Greek women, captives in Egypt, recount how they heard her wailing. Helen grieves for Troy destroyed in her name, Leda dead, her brothers vanished, Menelaus lost. She mentions her birth from an egg as a "prodigy which wondering mortals gaze at."

### Theonoe consultation (offstage)
The Chorus advises Helen to consult Theonoe about whether Menelaus lives. Helen enters the palace; the Chorus reports that Theonoe has confirmed Menelaus lives, wandering at sea, not yet home.

### Menelaus's arrival
Menelaus enters as a shipwrecked beggar in rags, his fleet destroyed. He traces his lineage to Pelops, Atreus, and Agamemnon. He has left "Helen" (the phantom) and his surviving crew in a cave while he seeks provisions. A Female Servant turns him away, warning that Theoclymenus kills Greeks, and tells him — to his bewilderment — that "Jove's daughter Helen dwells" within the palace. She has been there since before the war.

### Recognition scene
Helen returns from consulting Theonoe and encounters Menelaus at the tomb. They recognise each other's likeness but Menelaus refuses to believe, since he has another Helen in a cave. A Messenger arrives with astonishing news: the phantom Helen has dissolved into air, speaking as she ascended: "O ye sons of hapless Phrygia, and of Greece: for me beside Scamander's conscious stream ye died, through Juno's arts." Only then does Menelaus accept the real Helen. They embrace.

### Messenger's speech on prophecy
The old Messenger denounces divination: Calchas never told the Greeks they were fighting for a cloud. "The best of seers are Prudence and Discernment."

### Theonoe scene
Theonoe enters with attendants bearing lustral torches. She reveals that a divine council is debating Menelaus's fate: Hera now favours his return (so Greece will learn the Judgment of Paris was a fraud); Aphrodite opposes it (to conceal that she bought her victory with Helen's name). The decision falls to Theonoe — she can save them by concealing Menelaus's presence, or destroy them by telling her brother.

Helen and Menelaus both plead. Helen invokes justice, her father Proteus's trust, and the moral law. Menelaus appeals to Proteus's tomb and refuses to weep or grovel, saying it would dishonour Troy's conqueror — but threatens to kill Helen and himself on the tomb if refused. Theonoe decides in their favour, citing her inheritance of justice from her father Proteus and grandfather Nereus: "from my birth, hath justice in this bosom fixed her shrine."

### The escape plot
Helen devises the plan: she will tell Theoclymenus that Menelaus is dead (Menelaus himself, disguised, will bring the news) and request a ship for Greek funerary rites at sea — offerings cast into the waves. Theoclymenus is completely deceived. He provides a Phoenician vessel with fifty oars and places it under Menelaus's command.

### The escape (Messenger speech)
Helen and Menelaus board the funeral ship with hidden Greek survivors. Once at sea, Menelaus sacrifices the bull to Poseidon, then signals his men to attack. Helen cheers them from the poop: "Where is the renown ye gained at Troy? display 'gainst these barbarians the same undaunted prowess." They overpower the Egyptian crew. Menelaus seizes the rudder and sails for Greece.

### Theoclymenus's rage and the Dioscuri
Theoclymenus discovers the deception and moves to kill his sister Theonoe for helping the Greeks. The Chorus physically blocks him. Castor and Pollux appear as gods and command him to stop: Helen was never destined for his bed; Theonoe acted rightly; his anger is unjust. They prophesy Helen's deification ("you shall be called a goddess") and Menelaus's passage to the Islands of the Blessed. An island near Athens will be named "Helen" — the place where Hermes first set her down. Theoclymenus yields.
