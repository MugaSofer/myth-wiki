## Overview

The Bacchae is Euripides' final masterpiece, produced posthumously. It tells of [Dionysus](../deities/dionysus.md)'s return to [Thebes](../places/thebes.md) — his mother Semele's birthplace — to establish his worship. When King Pentheus resists, Dionysus drives him mad, lures him to spy on the Bacchic rites, and has him torn apart by his own mother Agave.

## Contents

### Prologue (1-63)
Dionysus arrives at Thebes in mortal disguise, explains his purpose: to vindicate his mother Semele and establish his worship. He has already driven Semele's sisters mad, and they sit on Cithaeron in Bacchic frenzy. He threatens to lead the Maenads in battle if Thebes resists.

### Parodos — Chorus of Asian Bacchants (64-169)
The Chorus celebrates Dionysus's birth from [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md)'s thigh, describes the Bacchic rites: the earth flows with milk, wine, and honey; torches blaze on thyrsi; the mountain revels.

### Tiresias and [Cadmus](../heroes/cadmus.md) (170-369)
[Tiresias](../heroes/tiresias.md) and old Cadmus dress in fawnskins and ivy, preparing to dance for Dionysus. Pentheus arrives and is outraged at their Bacchic costume. Tiresias delivers a speech defending Dionysus: he is one of two supreme powers (alongside Demeter), he invented wine, he is a prophet, and he shares qualities of [Ares](../deities/ares.md). Cadmus pragmatically urges Pentheus to accept the god. Pentheus orders the stranger hunted down.

### Dionysus Captured and Interrogated (434-518)
A servant brings the disguised Dionysus, who came willingly and smiling. The imprisoned Bacchants escaped supernaturally — "of their own accord the fetters were loosed from their feet, and the keys opened the doors without mortal hand." Pentheus interrogates Dionysus about his appearance, his rites, and his claims.

### The Palace Miracle (576-641)
Dionysus calls from within the prison; the palace shakes; fire blazes from Semele's tomb. The Chorus falls to the ground. Dionysus emerges, explaining he tricked Pentheus into binding a bull instead of him, while Bacchus shook the house and Pentheus stabbed at empty air.

### First Messenger Speech (660-774)
A herdsman reports what he saw on Cithaeron: the Bacchants sleeping modestly (not debauched as Pentheus claimed); Agave rousing them; miraculous springs of water, wine, milk, and honey from the ground and thyrsi; women nursing wolf cubs and fawns; superhuman strength tearing bulls apart with bare hands; immunity to weapons (spears could not wound them, but their thyrsi drew blood); fire in their hair that did not burn.

### The Persuasion (810-861)
Dionysus persuades Pentheus to spy on the Bacchants. Pentheus must wear women's clothes — linen garments, a turban, a thyrsus, and deer-skin.

### The Dressing Scene (912-976)
Pentheus emerges in Bacchic dress, already half-mad — he sees two suns, twin Thebes, and Dionysus appears to him as a bull with horns. Dionysus adjusts his costume. Pentheus, now raving, believes he could carry Mount Cithaeron on his shoulders.

### Second Messenger Speech (1024-1152)
The messenger describes Pentheus's death. Dionysus bent a pine tree to the earth with supernatural strength — "doing no mortal's deed" — and placed Pentheus atop it. A voice from the sky called out: "O youthful women, I bring you him who made you and me and my orgies a laughing-stock: but punish ye him." Holy fire blazed between heaven and earth. Agave led the attack; Pentheus pleaded "I, indeed, O mother, am thy child" but she was possessed by Bacchus and tore off his shoulder. Ino and Autonoe completed the dismemberment. Agave carried his head on a thyrsus, believing it a lion's.

### Agave's Recognition (1168-1221)
Agave returns with Pentheus's head, boasting of her "lion" kill. Cadmus, who has gathered Pentheus's scattered body from the mountain, gradually brings her to sanity. She recognizes the head as her son's.

### Dionysus's Judgment (1330-1392)
Dionysus appears as himself (a lacuna in the text precedes this). He decrees that Cadmus and Harmonia will be transformed into serpents and will lead a barbarian army against Greek cities. Their army will sack the oracle of [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) but have a miserable return, until [Ares](../deities/ares.md) rescues them to the Islands of the Blessed. Cadmus protests: "It is not right for Gods to resemble mortals in anger." Dionysus replies: "My father, Jove, long ago decreed this."
