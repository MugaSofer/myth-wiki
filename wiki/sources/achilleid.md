## Overview

The **Achilleid** is an unfinished epic by Statius, intended to cover the entire life of [Achilles](../heroes/achilles.md) but breaking off early in Book 2. What survives covers: [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md)'s attempt to prevent Achilles from going to the [Trojan War](../events/trojan-war.md) by hiding him among the daughters of King Lycomedes on [Scyros](../places/scyros.md); his discovery by [Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md) and [Diomedes](../heroes/diomedes.md); and the beginning of his journey to Troy.

The poem is the only surviving ancient text that explicitly describes Thetis dipping the infant Achilles in the waters of [Styx](../deities/styx.md) to make him invulnerable — the famous tradition of the vulnerable heel. It also provides the fullest account of Achilles' training under [Chiron](../creatures/chiron.md) and his relationship with [Deidamia](../heroes/deidamia.md).

## Contents

### Book 1 (960 lines)

- **1-19**: Invocation. Statius announces his subject: "great-hearted Aeacides," the whole story of the hero.
- **20-94**: Thetis sees Paris's fleet and panics. She begs Neptune to sink the ships; he refuses, saying the war is fated by Jupiter, but promises she will have her revenge on the Greek return voyage.
- **95-197**: Thetis goes to Chiron's cave on Pelion. Finds Achilles returning from a hunt — radiant, carrying lion cubs, already tall enough to equal his mother. Patroclus follows him, "bound to him even then by a strong affection." She asks to take Achilles for a purification rite (lying about her true purpose).
- **198-241**: Thetis carries the sleeping Achilles by dolphin-chariot across the sea to Scyros. Chiron watches them disappear; the nymphs of Thessaly mourn.
- **242-396**: On Scyros, Thetis disguises Achilles as a maiden. He resists, but seeing Deidamia among the princesses, is persuaded by desire. Thetis presents "her daughter" to King Lycomedes. She prays for the island's silence, comparing it to Crete sheltering the infant Zeus.
- **397-466**: Greece mobilises for war. Detailed catalogue of preparations. "Thessaly alone bewails her indolent repose."
- **467-559**: At Aulis, Protesilaus demands Calchas find the missing Achilles. Calchas is seized by prophetic frenzy: "Whither bearest thou, O Nereid, by thy woman's guile great Chiron's mighty pupil?" He reveals Achilles is hidden among maidens on Scyros. Odysseus and Diomedes are sent.
- **560-591**: Achilles courts Deidamia in disguise. She suspects but does not confront him.
- **592-674**: During a Bacchic festival, Achilles rapes Deidamia. She conceals the pregnancy with her nurse's help and bears a son (Pyrrhus/Neoptolemus).
- **675-808**: Odysseus and Diomedes arrive at Scyros. At the banquet, Odysseus scans the maidens and suspects one who sits with "head erect and wandering gaze" — but Deidamia covers Achilles' bare arms and restrains him. Odysseus goads him with tales of glory.
- **809-884**: The trap. Diomedes lays out gifts: feminine trinkets mixed with a shield and spear. The princesses choose the trinkets; Achilles seizes the arms. Agyrtes blows the war-trumpet. Achilles stands revealed, towering over Odysseus and Diomedes. "The daughter of Peleus is sought in vain."
- **885-960**: Achilles reveals himself to Lycomedes, asks for Deidamia's hand, presents his son. Lycomedes consents. Deidamia's lament at parting: "Go, and be cautious, and remember that the fears of Thetis were not vain; go, and good luck be with thee, and come back mine!"

### Book 2 (167 lines — unfinished)

- **1-22**: Achilles departs, sacrificing a bull to Neptune, a heifer to his mother. "Mother, I have obeyed thee, though thy commands were hard to bear."
- **23-84**: At sea, Odysseus tells Achilles the story of the Judgement of Paris and Helen's abduction. Achilles' hand flies to his sword when Odysseus asks "What if someone now were to carry off Deidamia?"
- **86-167**: Diomedes asks Achilles about his training. Achilles describes his upbringing under Chiron: fed on lion's entrails and wolf's bowels, trained to outrun deer and horses, sent against bears and tigers, taught to stand against raging rivers, master of every weapon and style of warfare, and instructed in medicine and "divine justice." The poem breaks off: "So much do I remember, friends, of the training of my earliest years, and sweet is their remembrance; the rest my mother knows."
