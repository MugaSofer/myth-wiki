## Overview

The *Prometheus Bound* dramatizes the punishment of [Prometheus](../deities/prometheus.md) for stealing fire and giving it to humanity. Chained to a crag in Scythia by [Hephaestus](../deities/hephaestus.md) at [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md)'s command, Prometheus receives a succession of visitors — the Oceanides (chorus), [Oceanus](../deities/oceanus.md), the wandering [Io](../heroes/io.md), and finally [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md) — and reveals both his past services to humanity and his secret knowledge of Zeus's eventual downfall. The play ends with Prometheus buried under the shattered crag by Zeus's earthquake and lightning, still defiant. It was the first play of a trilogy (the lost *Prometheus Unbound* and *Prometheus the Fire-Bearer* followed).

## Contents

- **Prologue (~1-87)**: Strength (Kratos) and Force (Bia) bring Prometheus to the Scythian rock. [Hephaestus](../deities/hephaestus.md), reluctant but obedient, chains him with iron bonds. Prometheus is silent throughout.
- **Prometheus's monologue (~88-127)**: Left alone, Prometheus calls on the elements to witness his suffering. "I am he who in a fennel-stalk, by stealthy sleight, purveyed the fount of fire."
- **Parodos (~128-192)**: The Chorus of Oceanides arrives in winged cars, drawn by the sound of Hephaestus's hammering. They weep at the sight.
- **First Episode (~193-396)**: Prometheus tells how he sided with Zeus against the [Titans](../deities/groups/titans.md), following his mother [Themis](../deities/themis.md)'s counsel. He describes Zeus's plan to destroy humanity and his own opposition: he gave mortals blind hope, fire, and all arts. He speaks of his brother [Atlas](../deities/atlas.md)'s burden and [Typho](../creatures/typhoeus.md)'s defeat.
- **First Stasimon (~397-435)**: The Chorus laments Prometheus's fate and sings of Atlas.
- **Second Episode (~436-525)**: [Oceanus](../deities/oceanus.md) arrives on a griffin, offering to intercede with Zeus. Prometheus warns him to stay out of it. Prometheus catalogues his gifts to humanity: number, writing, animal domestication, sailing, medicine, divination, mining. "All arts, for mortals' use, Prometheus gave."
- **Second Stasimon (~526-560)**: The Chorus sings of Prometheus's wedding to Hesione; then Io enters.
- **Third Episode (~561-886)**: [Io](../heroes/io.md), horned and maddened by the gadfly, arrives. She tells of Zeus's desire, the oracle that drove her from her father [Inachus](../heroes/inachus.md), and her transformation. Prometheus prophesies her future wanderings through Scythia, the Caucasus, the Amazons, the Bosporus (named for her), and finally to Egypt, where Zeus will restore her by touch. She will bear Epaphus; from his line will come the fifty [Danaids](../heroes/danaids.md), and from Hypermnestra's son, a royal line whose thirteenth generation will produce the archer-hero ([Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md)) who will free Prometheus.
- **Third Stasimon (~887-907)**: The Chorus prays never to be wooed by Zeus.
- **Fourth Episode (~908-1035)**: Prometheus declares Zeus will fall through a marriage that produces a child mightier than the father. [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md) arrives, demanding Zeus's secret. Prometheus refuses with contempt: "I loathe all gods that are." Hermes warns of burial in rock and an eagle devouring his liver daily.
- **Exodos (~1036-1093)**: The Chorus refuses to abandon Prometheus. Thunder and lightning strike; the rocks shatter and bury Prometheus, who calls on Earth and Sky to witness his wrong.
