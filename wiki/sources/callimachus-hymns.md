## Overview

Callimachus was a Greek poet and scholar of the Library of Alexandria. Of his voluminous output, only six hymns and sixty-three epigrams survive complete. The hymns are learned, allusive compositions that weave mythological narrative with cultic ritual and Alexandrian literary polish. They draw on earlier traditions but frequently present distinctive versions of myths.

## Contents

### Hymn I. To Zeus (96 lines)

Zeus's birth in Arcadia (not Crete — "Cretans are ever liars"). [Rheia](../deities/rhea.md) bore him in Parrhasia, smote a mountain with her staff to produce water. The nymph Neda carried the infant to Crete, where the [Curetes](../creatures/curetes.md) danced around him, [Adrasteia](../deities/adrasteia.md) laid him in a golden cradle, and the she-goat [Amaltheia](../creatures/amaltheia.md) suckled him. Zeus's sovereignty came not by lot-casting but by might — a variant from Homer and Apollodorus. Zeus chose kings for his portion. Closes with praise of Ptolemy Philadelphus.

### Hymn II. To Apollo (113 lines)

[Apollo](../deities/apollo.md)'s epiphany at his shrine. His appearance: golden tunic, mantle, lyre, bow, quiver, and sandals; "ever beautiful and ever young"; locks that "distil fragrant oils upon the ground." His skills: archery, song, divination, medicine. His service as herdsman to [Admetus](../heroes/admetus.md). Built his first altar of horns on Ortygia (Delos) at age four. His slaying of the Python at Pytho. Various cult epithets: Nomius, Boëdromius, Clarius, Carneius. Closes with Apollo spurning Envy.

### Hymn III. To Artemis (268 lines)

The longest and narratively richest hymn. [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md) as a little child on [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md)'s knee, requesting her gifts: eternal maidenhood, bow and arrows, sixty Ocean-nymph attendants, all mountains, and the role of Bringer of Light and helper in childbirth. Zeus grants all gladly. She visits the [Cyclopes](../creatures/cyclopes.md) at their forge (vivid physical description), commissions her bow, and at age three plucks hair from Brontes's chest. She gets hunting dogs from [Pan](../deities/pan.md). Captures four golden-horned deer; the fifth escapes for [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md)' labour. Extended account of her favourite haunts, companions ([Britomartis](../heroes/britomartis.md)/Dictyna, Cyrene, Procris, Anticleia, [Atalanta](../heroes/atalanta.md)), the Amazon founding of her temple at Ephesus, and the punishments of Oeneus and Agamemnon. A comic portrait of Heracles as insatiable glutton waiting for Artemis's game at the gates of Olympus.

### Hymn IV. To Delos (326 lines)

The longest hymn by line count. The birth of [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) on [Delos](../places/delos.md). The island was formerly Asteria, who leapt from heaven into the sea to escape Zeus's advances. [Hera](../deities/hera.md)'s persecution of [Leto](../deities/leto.md): Ares watches the continent from Thracian Haemus, Iris watches the islands from Mimas. All lands flee from Leto. Apollo prophesies from the womb against Thebes (for Niobe's future insult). The river Peneius offers compassion despite Hera's threats; Ares threatens to destroy him. Asteria/Delos alone receives Leto. Leto gives birth leaning on a palm tree by the stream Inopus. Seven swans circle — hence the seven strings of the lyre. Delos becomes golden and rooted in place. Hera's mixed reaction: anger at Leto, but honour for Asteria who "did not desecrate my bed, but instead of Zeus preferred the sea."

### Hymn V. On the Bath of Pallas (142 lines)

Set during the ritual bathing of [Athena](../deities/athena.md)'s image at Argos. Athena's character: spurns perfume, uses only olive oil; "Always her face is fair." Reference to the Judgment of Paris: Athena did not look in a mirror, but [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md) "took the shining bronze and often altered and again altered the same lock." The central narrative is the **blinding of [Teiresias](../heroes/teiresias.md)**: young Teiresias accidentally saw Athena bathing at the Fountain of the Horse on Helicon. Athena blinded him instantly. His mother Chariclo (Athena's beloved companion) lamented, but Athena explained it was the law of Zeus: whoever sees an immortal uninvited pays a heavy price. She compensated Teiresias with the gift of prophecy, a guiding staff, long life, and understanding even in death. Athena contrasts his fate with the worse one awaiting [Actaeon](../heroes/actaeon.md), who will see [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md) bathing and be devoured by his own dogs. Confirms Athena's birth: "no mother bare that goddess, but the head of Zeus."

### Hymn VI. To Demeter (138 lines)

Set during a procession of [Demeter](../deities/demeter.md)'s sacred basket. Brief allusion to Demeter's search for [Persephone](../deities/persephone.md) — wandering to the West, to the land of the "black men," fasting and unwashed. Triptolemus taught agriculture. The main narrative is the **punishment of Erysichthon**, son of Triopas. He cut trees in Demeter's sacred grove at Dotium despite the goddess's warning (disguised as her priestess Nicippe). Demeter revealed her true form — "Her steps touched the earth, but her head reached unto Olympus" — and cursed him with insatiable hunger. He devoured everything: twenty men prepared his banquet, his parents' herds, mules, the heifer for Hestia, racing horses, even the cat. His parents invented excuses to keep him from society. Finally he begged at crossroads. His father Triopas appealed to Poseidon (Triopas's divine father through Canace) in vain.
