## Overview

The **Iliad** is an epic poem attributed to Homer, set during the final year of the Trojan War. It focuses on the wrath of Achilles and its consequences — his quarrel with Agamemnon, his withdrawal from battle, and the devastating effects on the Greek army. The gods are active participants throughout, intervening on both sides of the conflict.
