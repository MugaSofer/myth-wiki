## Overview

**Works and Days** is a didactic poem by Hesiod addressed to his brother Perses, covering themes of justice, honest labour, and the proper ordering of life. Unlike the [Theogony](theogony.md), which narrates divine genealogy, Works and Days is concerned with the human world — but its opening sections contain significant mythological material, including a second (and different) account of [Prometheus](../deities/prometheus.md) and the creation of [Pandora](#pandora), and the myth of the Five Ages of Man.

## Relationship to the Theogony

Works and Days retells the Prometheus myth with significant differences:

- In the [Theogony](theogony.md), the first woman is unnamed and the focus is on the trick at Mecone. In Works and Days, she is named **Pandora** and the focus is on the jar of evils.
- The Theogony describes [Prometheus](../deities/prometheus.md)'s punishment (bound, eagle eating his liver). Works and Days focuses on humanity's punishment through Pandora.
- Both agree that [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) hid fire and the means of life from men in anger at Prometheus's deception.
