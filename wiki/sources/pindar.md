## Overview

The **Odes** of Pindar are choral victory songs composed for winners at the four great Panhellenic games: Olympian (at Olympia), Pythian (at Delphi), Nemean (at Nemea), and Isthmian (at Corinth). Each ode celebrates a specific athletic victory but typically includes extended mythological narratives as digressions — retellings or allusions to the myths of heroes and gods, often connected thematically to the victor, his city, or the games' founding.

Pindar's mythological retellings are distinctive: he frequently challenges received versions, explicitly rejecting stories he considers unworthy of the gods (most famously the cannibal feast of Tantalus in Olympian I). His versions often differ from other sources and provide valuable variant traditions.

### Olympian Odes

- **I** (For Hieron of Syracuse, horse-race): The [Pelops](../heroes/pelops.md) myth — Pindar rejects the cannibal feast of Tantalus; instead, [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) loved Pelops and snatched him to heaven (parallel to Ganymede); ivory shoulder from birth; Tantalus punished for stealing nectar/ambrosia; Pelops returns to earth, prays to Poseidon at night by the sea; given golden car and winged steeds; defeats Oinomaos; wins Hippodameia; founds the Olympic games; six sons; honoured at his tomb beside Alpheos
- **II** (For Theron of Akragas, chariot-race): Afterlife theology — the righteous enjoy sunlit rest; those steadfast through three lives reach the Islands of the Blessed; golden flowers, Ocean-breezes, Rhadamanthys judges beside [Cronos](../deities/cronos.md); Peleus, [Kadmos](../heroes/cadmus.md), and [Achilles](../heroes/achilles.md) dwell there (Thetis brought Achilles when she moved Zeus's heart). Also: Kadmos's daughters — Semele lives among Olympians, Ino immortal among sea-maids of Nereus. Theban genealogy: Laios slain by [Oedipus](../heroes/oedipus.md); Erinys slew his sons; Thersander lived and won honour.
- **III** (For Theron, chariot-race): [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) founded the Olympic games; brought the olive from the Hyperboreans (who serve [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md)); Leto's horse-loving daughter ([Artemis](../deities/artemis.md)) received him during the hind labour; Taygete vowed the golden-horned hind to Artemis; Dioskouroi (Kastor and Polydeukes) charged with overseeing the games

## Translation Notes

Myers's translation is in elevated prose, fairly literal but sometimes archaic. Names generally follow Greek forms (Kronos, Poseidon, Herakles) rather than Latin.
