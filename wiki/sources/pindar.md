## Overview

The **Odes** of Pindar are choral victory songs composed for winners at the four great Panhellenic games: Olympian (at Olympia), Pythian (at Delphi), Nemean (at Nemea), and Isthmian (at Corinth). Each ode celebrates a specific athletic victory but typically includes extended mythological narratives as digressions — retellings or allusions to the myths of heroes and gods, often connected thematically to the victor, his city, or the games' founding.

Pindar's mythological retellings are distinctive: he frequently challenges received versions, explicitly rejecting stories he considers unworthy of the gods (most famously the cannibal feast of Tantalus in Olympian I). His versions often differ from other sources and provide valuable variant traditions.

Myers's translation is in elevated prose, fairly literal but sometimes archaic. Names generally follow Greek forms (Kronos, Poseidon, Herakles) rather than Latin.
