## Overview

**Philoctetes** is a tragedy by Sophocles, produced in 409 BCE and awarded first prize. The play dramatises the mission of [Neoptolemus](../heroes/neoptolemus.md) and [Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md) to retrieve [Philoctetes](../heroes/philoctetes.md) — who has been marooned on [Lemnos](../places/lemnos.md) for ten years with an agonising, festering wound — because the prophet [Helenus](../heroes/helenus.md) has declared Troy cannot fall without [Heracles'](../heroes/heracles.md) bow. The central drama is moral rather than martial: Neoptolemus must choose between Odysseus's pragmatic deceit and his own instinct for honesty and compassion.

The play is resolved by the appearance of [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) as deus ex machina, who commands Philoctetes to go willingly to Troy.

## Contents

### Prologue (Odysseus and Neoptolemus)

[Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md) and [Neoptolemus](../heroes/neoptolemus.md) arrive on [Lemnos](../places/lemnos.md). Odysseus identifies the cave where he left [Philoctetes](../heroes/philoctetes.md) ten years before: a crude bed of leaves, a wooden cup, rags drying in the sun. He tells Neoptolemus the plan: he must deceive Philoctetes with a false story, gain his trust, and win the bow. Neoptolemus objects: "'Tis not my nature, no, nor, as they tell, my father's, to work aught by craft and guile." Odysseus counters: "Words and not deeds give mastery over men," and reminds him that Troy cannot be taken otherwise. Neoptolemus reluctantly agrees.

### Philoctetes' Appearance

The chorus of Neoptolemus's sailors arrive. Philoctetes emerges from his cave — dishevelled, in pain, clad in rags. He is overjoyed to hear Greek voices after years of isolation. Learning that Neoptolemus is [Achilles'](../heroes/achilles.md) son, he tells of his abandonment: bitten by a serpent, his wound festering and stinking, the Greeks left him here at Odysseus's instigation and under [Agamemnon](../heroes/agamemnon.md)'s orders.

### The False Story

Neoptolemus tells a fabricated tale: he sailed to Troy to claim his father's arms after [Achilles'](../heroes/achilles.md) death, but the Atreidae and Odysseus refused him, giving the arms to Odysseus instead. Furious, he left for home. Philoctetes recognises a kindred spirit — one wronged by the same men. He asks after the war's dead: [Ajax](../heroes/ajax.md) dead, [Patroclus](../heroes/patroclus.md) dead, [Antilochus](../heroes/antilochus.md) dead. "War doth not willingly snatch off the wicked, but still takes the good." He asks about Thersites and is told he lives — "He must be: for no evil yet was crushed."

Philoctetes begs Neoptolemus to take him home. The chorus urges pity.

### The Merchant's Warning

A man disguised as a merchant (sent by Odysseus) arrives claiming that Phoenix and others are pursuing Neoptolemus, and that Odysseus and [Diomedes](../heroes/diomedes.md) have sailed to fetch Philoctetes by force. He reveals the prophecy of [Helenus](../heroes/helenus.md): the Trojan prince, captured by Odysseus, foretold that Troy could not fall without Philoctetes and the bow. Philoctetes resolves to leave at once.

### The Bow

Philoctetes shows Neoptolemus [Heracles'](../heroes/heracles.md) bow — "Here in my hand. The world hath only one." Neoptolemus asks to hold it reverently, "as on a thing from Heaven." Philoctetes grants this: "Thou, that hast given me light and life... may'st vaunt alone of mortals for thine excellence to have held this in thy touch."

### The Paroxysm

As they prepare to leave, Philoctetes' wound erupts in agonising pain. He screams, begs Neoptolemus to cut off his foot, calls on death. He entrusts the bow to Neoptolemus for safekeeping, making him swear not to surrender it. He collapses into exhausted sleep. The chorus urges Neoptolemus to take the bow and flee — but Neoptolemus refuses: "He must sail with us. So the god hath said."

### Neoptolemus's Crisis

When Philoctetes wakes, grateful for Neoptolemus's faithfulness, Neoptolemus breaks down: "My baseness will appear. That wrings my soul." He reveals the truth — Philoctetes must go to Troy, not home. Philoctetes is devastated: "Me miserable! I am betrayed, undone!" He demands his bow back.

### Odysseus Intervenes

[Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md) appears and claims the bow will go to Troy with or without Philoctetes. He invokes Zeus's authority: "'Tis Zeus, I tell thee, monarch of this isle, who thus hath willed. I am his minister." He declares they have Teucer and himself to wield the bow — Philoctetes is dispensable. He leaves with the bow, ordering Neoptolemus to follow.

### Philoctetes' Monody

Left alone, Philoctetes laments in lyric: he will starve without his bow, unable to hunt; the creatures he once preyed upon will now prey on him. He calls for death.

### The Return of the Bow

Neoptolemus returns, defying Odysseus. He intends to give the bow back. Odysseus threatens him with the army's wrath; Neoptolemus responds: "In doing right I fear not them nor thee." They nearly draw swords before Odysseus retreats. Neoptolemus returns the bow to Philoctetes and reveals the full prophecy: Philoctetes bears his wound by divine doom for approaching the serpent-guardian of Chrysa's shrine; the sons of [Asclepius](../heroes/asclepius.md) will heal him at Troy; he and the bow will take the city.

Philoctetes still refuses. He asks Neoptolemus to take him home instead. Neoptolemus, bound by his promise, agrees.

### Heracles Ex Machina

As they prepare to depart, [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) appears from above. He tells Philoctetes of his own path from toils to immortal glory: "after my long toils by strange adventure I have found and won immortal glory... and the like lot, I tell thee, shall be thine." He commands Philoctetes to sail to Troy, where he will be healed, kill [Paris](../heroes/paris.md) with the bow, and capture Troy. He tells Neoptolemus that neither can conquer without the other: "like twin lions hunting the same hill, guard thou him, and he thee!" He warns them to hold the gods in awe: "our great Father counteth piety far above all."

Philoctetes obeys: "Thy dear voice is law to me." He bids farewell to Lemnos — the cave, the nymphs, the headland, the fountains — and they depart.
