## Overview

The *Cyclops* is the only complete satyr play to survive from ancient Greece. It dramatises the same episode as [Odyssey](odyssey.md) Book IX — [Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md)'s encounter with Polyphemus in his cave — but adds [Silenus](../heroes/silenus.md) and a Chorus of Satyrs as comic characters enslaved by the Cyclops and desperate to return to [Dionysus](../deities/dionysus.md). The play follows the Homeric plot (arrival, cannibalism, intoxication, "Noman" ruse, blinding, escape) while introducing extensive comic business, philosophical speeches, and the Satyrs' cowardice.

## Contents

### Silenus's Prologue
[Silenus](../heroes/silenus.md), father of the Satyrs, explains how he and his sons came to be enslaved. They had set out to rescue [Dionysus](../deities/dionysus.md) when he was kidnapped by Tyrrhenian pirates. A storm drove them to Sicily — "Mount Ætna's promontory" — where the one-eyed sons of [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md), the [Cyclopes](../creatures/cyclopes.md), captured them. Silenus tends Polyphemus's flocks while the Satyrs herd on the mountains, longing to return to Bacchus's revels.

### Arrival of Odysseus
[Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md) arrives with his crew seeking provisions. He has come from [Troy](../places/troy.md), blown off course to Sicily. Silenus, overjoyed to meet Greeks, immediately offers to trade Polyphemus's cheese, lambs, and milk for wine. When he tastes the wine — "a perfume exquisitely sweet" — he dances with delight: "shall I not drink just one cup? as it drinks, it winks at me, it beckons me."

### Odysseus's Appeal to Xenia
Odysseus offers gold and wine. When Silenus warns that Polyphemus "feeds on strangers," Odysseus is unafraid: he survived the sack of Troy and the hardships of the sea. He appeals to the principles of [xenia](../concepts/xenia.md): "you who dwell upon the borders of the Ætnaean rock receive the sea-tossed wanderers, and afford them shelter."

### Polyphemus's Arrival
The Cyclops returns and finds strangers in his cave. Silenus immediately lies, claiming the strangers attacked him and stole the food by force — though the Chorus contradicts him. Polyphemus asks about the strangers' origin; when told they are Greeks returning from Troy, he scorns them for waging war "for one woman."

### Rejection of the Gods
Odysseus appeals to divine law: they are suppliants who have served [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) by preserving his temples at [Troy](../places/troy.md). Polyphemus delivers a striking speech rejecting all divine authority: "Wealth is the deity the wise adore; all other objects I as trifles scorn, as the vain sayings of vain men deride." He denies fearing [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md)'s thunderbolt: when it thunders, he shelters in his cave and eats, and "when the north wind pours down snow, I wrap me in the skins of beasts, kindle a fire, and scorn the snow." He declares that he sacrifices to no god but himself — "to the greatest of all gods — this belly."[^eur-cyc-belly]

### The Cannibal Feast
Polyphemus seizes two of Odysseus's companions and drags them into the cave. Odysseus emerges to describe the horror: one man was dashed against a rock "like a whelp against the sharp and craggy stones," the other held by his ankle and butchered. "This dismal scene I saw with weeping eyes, and waited on the Cyclops: others clung, like birds with terror, to the craggy cliffs, their bodies drained of colour."[^eur-cyc-feast]

### The Blinding Plan
Odysseus tells the Chorus his plan: get Polyphemus drunk on the wine, then drive the heated olive-wood brand into his eye while he sleeps. The Satyrs enthusiastically agree: "with courage whirl the brand, delay not to scorch out the eye of him who banquets on the stranger's flesh."

### The Intoxication
Polyphemus emerges drunk and content — "like a well-freighted ship my stomach's with abundant viands stowed up to my very chin." Odysseus plies him with wine while Silenus keeps sneaking drinks, claiming "the gentle Bacchus gave that kiss, because I look so blooming." In a comic exchange, Polyphemus sees visions: "the very heavens whirl round mingled with earth. I view Jove's throne sublime, and the whole synod of encircling gods." He drunkenly declares he would not kiss all the Graces — "Ganymede himself appears in matchless beauty" — and drags Silenus inside as his "Ganymede."

### The "Noman" Ruse
Asked his name, Odysseus replies: "Noman is my name." Polyphemus promises his reward: "The last of all the crew will I devour."

### The Satyrs' Cowardice
When the moment comes to carry the brand, the Satyrs find excuses — they are "not tall enough," they are suddenly lame, their eyes are "filled with dust or ashes." One claims to know "a magic incantation devised by Orpheus, which hath such effect, that of its own accord the brand shall pierce the skull of him, the one-eyed son of earth." Odysseus, disgusted, relies on his own men: "these allies of mine are worthless cowards."[^eur-cyc-cowards]

### The Blinding
Odysseus invokes [Hephaestus](../deities/hephaestus.md) ("Vulcan, king of Ætna") and Sleep. Polyphemus screams from within: "by burning coals I am deprived of eyesight!" The Chorus mocks him: "That was a melodious pæan: to me, O Cyclops, sing th' enchanting strain."

### "Noman" Wordplay
Blinded, Polyphemus rages: "Noman hath ruined me." The Chorus exploits the pun: "To you then no one hath offered any wrong... How can no man put out your eye?... He is nowhere, Cyclops." They deliberately misdirect the blinded giant, sending him crashing into rocks.

### Odysseus's Revelation and Prophecy
Odysseus reveals his true identity and proclaims divine justice: "It was destined you should suffer a just requital for your impious feast; for I in vain had with consuming flames laid Ilion waste, had I forborne t' avenge on you the murder of my valiant friends." Polyphemus recalls "that ancient oracle... which foretold, that I by thee, on thy return from Troy, should be deprived of sight" but counters that Odysseus too "shalt be punished, and full long endure the beating of tempestuous waves."[^eur-cyc-prophecy] Polyphemus threatens to hurl rocks; the Chorus declares itself "blest partners in Ulysses' voyage" who "henceforth the laws of Bacchus will obey."

[^eur-cyc-cowards]: "These allies of mine are worthless cowards" (Cyclops, trans. Michael Wodhull)
[^eur-cyc-prophecy]: "Now is that ancient oracle, alas! accomplished, which foretold, that I by thee, on thy return from Troy, should be deprived of sight: but that thou also for a deed so cruel, shalt be punished, and full long endure the beating of tempestuous waves" (Cyclops, trans. Michael Wodhull)
