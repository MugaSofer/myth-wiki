## Overview

The *Andromache* dramatises the aftermath of the Trojan War through two crises in the household of [Neoptolemus](../heroes/neoptolemus.md). In the first half, [Andromache](../heroes/andromache.md) — Neoptolemus's war-prize and concubine, who has borne him a son, Molossus — is threatened with death by [Hermione](../heroes/hermione.md) (Neoptolemus's barren wife) and [Menelaus](../heroes/menelaus.md). In the second half, [Orestes](../heroes/orestes.md) arrives, takes Hermione away, and reveals he has arranged Neoptolemus's murder at Delphi. [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md) appears as deus ex machina to prophesy the future: Andromache will marry Helenus in Molossia, founding a royal line; [Peleus](../heroes/peleus.md) will be made immortal and dwell with Thetis in the sea.

The play is set at [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md)'s temple between Phthia and Pharsalia in Thessaly. Neoptolemus is absent throughout, having gone to Delphi to atone for previously demanding Apollo compensate him for [Achilles](../heroes/achilles.md)' death.

## Contents

### Prologue (Andromache)
Andromache recalls her fall: daughter of Eetion, wife of [Hector](../heroes/hector.md), she watched Hector killed by Achilles and her son Astyanax thrown from Troy's walls. Given to Neoptolemus as a war-prize, she bore him Molossus. Now Hermione persecutes her, accusing her of using drugs to cause barrenness and hatred. Andromache has taken sanctuary at Thetis's temple; she has secretly sent Molossus away and dispatched messengers to Peleus for help.

### Andromache–Hermione confrontation
Hermione arrives, adorned in Spartan gold, and demands Andromache leave the temple. She accuses Andromache of bewitching her husband and making her barren: "thy drugs have made me odious." She insults Andromache for sleeping with the son of her husband's killer: "thou dar'st to sleep e'en with the son of him who slew thy husband." Andromache responds with dignity, arguing that Hermione's barrenness comes from her own character, not magic: "Not beauty, but the virtues, O woman, to the partners of our bed afford delight." She contrasts her own conduct as Hector's wife — even nursing his children by other women — with Hermione's jealousy.

### Menelaus's coercion
Menelaus arrives with the captured Molossus and forces Andromache to choose: die herself and save the child, or watch him killed. Andromache delivers a scathing speech denouncing Menelaus's fame as hollow — he destroyed Troy over a worthless woman, yet bullies a helpless captive. She leaves the altar to save her son. Menelaus immediately betrays the deal: he will kill both. "I proposed to slay your son, that you might leave that hallowed altar of Thetis, and thus craftily induced you to fall into my hands."

### Peleus's rescue
Peleus arrives and rescues Andromache and Molossus. He delivers the play's most famous speech attacking Menelaus: Spartan women run around with bare legs and loose clothing wrestling with young men, so it's no wonder they prove unchaste; Helen was worthless and Menelaus should have abandoned her rather than waging war; Menelaus came home from Troy unwounded while real heroes died; Menelaus sacrificed Iphigenia out of fear of losing Helen; and when he finally had Helen in his power after the sack, he saw her breast and dropped his sword. Menelaus retreats, claiming a war in Sparta demands his return.

### Hermione's panic and Orestes
After Menelaus abandons her, Hermione realizes the consequences of her plot. She tries to hang herself and seize a sword; her Nurse restrains her. She confesses that "vile women" inflamed her jealousy with destructive counsel: "Never, never should wedded men let women have a free access, and visit their consort."

Orestes arrives. He reveals he was betrothed to Hermione before Menelaus gave her to Neoptolemus as a war-prize. He has already arranged Neoptolemus's murder: confederates are stationed at Delphi to ambush him with the help of the Delphian citizens, whom Orestes has incited by whispering that Neoptolemus has come to plunder Apollo's temple. He takes Hermione away.

### Messenger speech: Neoptolemus's death
A Messenger describes the killing at Delphi. Neoptolemus stood at the altar offering prayers and sacrifices when armed men hidden behind the laurels attacked him. He snatched arms from the temple wall and fought spectacularly — driving his attackers like doves — but a voice from the inner sanctuary rallied them. He was struck through the flank and overwhelmed, his body disfigured with countless wounds and cast from the temple.

### Thetis as deus ex machina
Thetis descends and commands: Neoptolemus is to be buried at Delphi, "so shall his tomb declare the murderous violence Orestes' band committed." Andromache must marry Helenus and settle in Molossia, where Molossus will found a dynasty: "from him in long succession shall a race of happy kings Molossia's sceptre wield." Peleus is promised immortality: Thetis will make him a god and take him to Nereus's underwater palace, where he will see Achilles "inhabiting that isle whose chalky coasts are laved by the surrounding Euxine deep" (the White Island, Leuke).
