## Overview

The *Heraclidae* dramatizes the aftermath of [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md)' death. His aged companion [Iolaus](../heroes/iolaus.md), together with [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md)' mother [Alcmena](../heroes/alcmena.md) and his young children, have been driven from city to city by [Eurystheus](../heroes/eurystheus.md), king of Mycenae, who fears the children will grow up to avenge their father. They take refuge as suppliants in Athens, where Demophoon (son of [Theseus](../heroes/theseus.md)) defends them against Eurystheus's herald Copreus.

When oracles demand the sacrifice of a noble virgin to [Persephone](../deities/persephone.md) (called "the daughter of Ceres") for victory, [Macaria](../heroes/macaria.md), daughter of [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md), volunteers willingly. The Athenians defeat the Argives in battle. [Iolaus](../heroes/iolaus.md), miraculously rejuvenated by [Hera](../deities/hera.md) and [Hebe](../deities/hebe.md), captures [Eurystheus](../heroes/eurystheus.md) at the Scironian rocks. [Alcmena](../heroes/alcmena.md) demands his execution despite Athenian law against killing prisoners. [Eurystheus](../heroes/eurystheus.md) prophesies that his buried body will protect Athens against future invasions by the Heraclidae's descendants.

## Contents

### Prologue (1–72)
[Iolaus](../heroes/iolaus.md) describes their plight as fugitives, driven from every Greek city by [Eurystheus](../heroes/eurystheus.md). They have come as suppliants to Marathon, near Athens. Copreus, Eurystheus's herald, arrives to drag them away.

### Parodos and Confrontation (73–287)
The Chorus of old Marathonians intervenes. Demophoon, son of [Theseus](../heroes/theseus.md), arrives and hears both sides. Copreus argues the suppliants belong to Argos; [Iolaus](../heroes/iolaus.md) appeals to kinship (Heracles saved [Theseus](../heroes/theseus.md) from the underworld) and the sanctity of suppliancy. Demophoon accepts the suppliants and dismisses the herald, who threatens war.

### The Oracle and Macaria's Sacrifice (288–629)
Demophoon reports that oracles demand the sacrifice of a noble-born virgin to "the daughter of Ceres" for victory. He refuses to sacrifice his own daughter or any citizen's child. [Macaria](../heroes/macaria.md), daughter of [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md), overhears and volunteers: "not caring for life, I have found this most glorious thing to find, namely, to leave life gloriously." She refuses to draw lots, insisting on a willing death, and asks to die at the hands of women rather than men.

### Preparation for Battle (630–747)
[Hyllus](../heroes/hyllus.md), eldest son of [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md), arrives with an allied army. The elderly [Iolaus](../heroes/iolaus.md) insists on joining the battle despite his age, taking captured arms from a temple.

### Messenger Speech: The Battle (748–891)
[Hyllus](../heroes/hyllus.md) challenges [Eurystheus](../heroes/eurystheus.md) to single combat; Eurystheus refuses. Battle is joined. The Athenians prevail. [Iolaus](../heroes/iolaus.md), pursuing Eurystheus's chariot, prays to [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) and [Hera](../deities/hera.md) to be young for one day. Two stars appear on his chariot, concealing it in cloud — identified as [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) and [Hebe](../deities/hebe.md). [Iolaus](../heroes/iolaus.md) emerges miraculously rejuvenated and captures [Eurystheus](../heroes/eurystheus.md) at the Scironian rocks.

### Eurystheus's Capture and Death (892–1055)
[Alcmena](../heroes/alcmena.md) confronts the captured [Eurystheus](../heroes/eurystheus.md), who claims [Hera](../deities/hera.md) compelled his enmity against [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) and his children. A messenger reports that Athenian law forbids killing prisoners of war. Alcmena insists on executing him regardless. Eurystheus prophesies that his body, buried before the temple of Athena at Pallene, will protect Athens against future invasions by the descendants of the Heraclidae. Alcmena orders him killed and his body given to the dogs.
