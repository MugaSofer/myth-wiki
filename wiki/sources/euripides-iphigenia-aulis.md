## Overview

*Iphigenia in Aulis* is one of Euripides' last plays, produced posthumously along with the *Bacchae*. It dramatizes the crisis at Aulis where the Greek fleet, becalmed by [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md), can only sail for [Troy](../places/troy.md) if [Agamemnon](../heroes/agamemnon.md) sacrifices his daughter [Iphigenia](../heroes/iphigenia.md). Agamemnon lures her with a false promise of marriage to [Achilles](../heroes/achilles.md), but the deception unravels. The play culminates in Iphigenia's voluntary self-sacrifice and her miraculous substitution by a stag.

## Contents

### 1. Prologue: Agamemnon's Dilemma (lines ~1-163)
Agamemnon, sleepless at night, tells the Old Man the background: the oath of [Helen](../heroes/helen.md)'s suitors, Paris's abduction, the fleet assembled at Aulis, [Calchas](../heroes/calchas.md)'s prophecy that Artemis demands Iphigenia's sacrifice. He had sent for Iphigenia under the pretext of marriage to Achilles, but now writes a second letter to stop her coming.

### 2. The Chorus's Catalogue (lines ~164-302)
The Chorus of Chalcidian women describes the Greek fleet at Aulis — a catalogue of ships and heroes echoing Homer. They observe Achilles racing in full armour against Eumelus's chariot along the shore, and enumerate the contingents: Myrmidons with Nereid figureheads, Argives under Sthenelus, Athenians under Theseus's son with Pallas on the prow, Boeotians with golden-dragon figureheads, Ajax of Salamis, and others.

### 3. The Brothers' Quarrel and Reversal (lines ~303-530)
[Menelaus](../heroes/menelaus.md) intercepts the letter. The brothers quarrel bitterly — Menelaus accuses Agamemnon of inconsistency and cowardice, Agamemnon retorts that Menelaus wants to recover a bad wife at his daughter's expense. But when news arrives that [Clytemnestra](../heroes/clytemnestra.md) and Iphigenia have already arrived, Menelaus reverses course and urges Agamemnon not to sacrifice her. Agamemnon replies it is too late — Calchas and [Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md) will rouse the army.

### 4. Achilles, Clytemnestra, and the Revelation (lines ~531-900)
Clytemnestra arrives expecting a wedding. She questions Agamemnon about Achilles' genealogy (Aegina → Aeacus → Peleus → Achilles; raised by [Chiron](../creatures/chiron.md)). When she meets Achilles, he knows nothing of any marriage. The Old Man reveals the truth: Agamemnon plans to sacrifice Iphigenia to Artemis. Achilles is outraged at his name being used and pledges to protect Iphigenia. Clytemnestra reveals that Agamemnon killed her first husband Tantalus and her infant child, and was saved from her brothers' vengeance by Tyndareus.

### 5. Iphigenia's Sacrifice and the Divine Substitution (lines ~901-1145)
Iphigenia first pleads with her father not to kill her. Agamemnon replies that Greece compels him. Achilles reports the army — even his own Myrmidons — demand the sacrifice and threatened to stone him. Iphigenia then reverses her plea and volunteers to die for Greece: "I give my body for Greece. Sacrifice it, and sack Troy." She bids farewell to her mother and young [Orestes](../heroes/orestes.md). At the altar, as the priest strikes, Iphigenia vanishes and a stag appears in her place. Calchas declares Artemis has accepted the substitution. Agamemnon tells Clytemnestra their daughter "really possesses a companionship with the Gods."

## Key Mythological Content

### Clytemnestra's First Marriage
Clytemnestra reveals that Agamemnon "didst wed me unwilling, and obtain me by force, having slain Tantalus, my former husband, and having dashed my infant living to the ground." The Dioscuri made war on Agamemnon but Tyndareus saved him. This tradition of Clytemnestra's first marriage to a Tantalus (not the famous Tantalus of Sipylus, but a son of Thyestes per Apollodorus) provides backstory for her eventual murder of Agamemnon.

### Odysseus as "Son of Sisyphus"
Both Agamemnon and Clytemnestra refer to Odysseus as "the son of Sisyphus" — reflecting the alternate tradition that Sisyphus, not Laertes, was Odysseus's true father. This was a common slander in tragedy.

### The Wedding of Peleus and Thetis
The Chorus sings of the wedding of Peleus and Thetis on Mount Pelion: the Muses came "striking their feet with golden sandals against the ground"; Ganymede poured nectar; the fifty Nereids danced; Centaurs attended; Chiron prophesied that Achilles would come to Troy in golden arms wrought by Hephaestus.

### Iphigenia's Sacrifice Speech
Iphigenia's transformation from terrified victim to willing martyr is the dramatic heart of the play. She declares: "I have determined to die, and this I would fain do gloriously... Greece, the greatest of cities, is now all looking upon me, and there rests in me both the passage of the ships and the destruction of Troy." She forbids her mother from mourning: "The altar of the Goddess, daughter of Jove, will be my memorial."

### The Divine Substitution
At the sacrifice, "every one could clearly perceive the sound of the blow, but beheld not the virgin, where on earth she had vanished." In her place "a stag lay panting on the ground, of mighty size to see and beautiful in appearance, with whose blood the altar of the Goddess was abundantly wetted." Calchas declares Artemis accepted the stag willingly. The messenger tells Clytemnestra "thy child has evidently flown to the Gods."

### The Judgement of Paris
Iphigenia recounts the Judgement: Pallas, "artful Venus," and Juno came to Paris, "Venus indeed, vaunting herself in charms, and Pallas in the spear, and Juno in the royal nuptials of king Jove." Paris's choice led to the war that now demands her death.
