## Overview

The **Homeric Hymns** are a collection of 33 anonymous Greek hymns, each addressed to a particular god. Despite their traditional attribution to Homer, they are by various authors from different periods. The four longest hymns — to [Demeter](../deities/demeter.md) (II), [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) (III), [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md) (IV), and [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md) (V) — are substantial narrative poems. The shorter hymns are brief invocations.
