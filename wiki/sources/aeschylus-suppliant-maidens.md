## Overview

The *Suppliant Maidens* dramatizes the arrival of the fifty daughters of [Danaus](../heroes/danaus.md) (the Danaids) in [Argos](../places/argos.md), fleeing forced marriage to their cousins, the fifty sons of Aegyptus. The play centers on the asylum dilemma: the Danaids claim Argive kinship through [Io](../heroes/io.md) and invoke [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) as protector of suppliants, while King Pelasgus must weigh their sacred claim against the risk of war with Egypt. The Argive assembly votes to protect the maidens. An Egyptian herald attempts to drag them from the altar by force but is confronted and expelled by Pelasgus. The play ends with the Danaids settled in Argos but fearing the war to come.

The play was part of a connected tetralogy (followed by *Egyptians* and *Danaids*, both lost, and the satyr play *Amymone*, also lost). Together they told the full story of the Danaids — their flight, the forced marriages, the murder of the bridegrooms on the wedding night (all except Hypermnestra who spared Lynceus), and some form of resolution.

## Contents

- **Argument**: The genealogy from Io through Epaphus, Libya, Belus, to Aegyptus and Danaus.
- **Parodos (~1-175)**: The Chorus of Danaids arrives at Argos, sitting as suppliants at an altar-mound sacred to multiple gods. They invoke Zeus, claim descent from Io, and recount her story — priestess of [Hera](../deities/hera.md), transformed into a cow, driven by a gadfly to Egypt, where Zeus restored her with his touch and she bore Epaphus.
- **First Episode (~176-233)**: Danaus advises his daughters to be reverent and cautious. He spots the approach of armed men.
- **Second Episode (~234-523)**: King Pelasgus of Argos arrives and questions the Danaids' identity. In stichomythia, they retell Io's story: her priesthood, Zeus's pursuit, Hera's jealousy, the transformation, [Argus](../creatures/argus-panoptes.md) the all-seeing herdsman, his death, the gadfly, and Io's flight to Egypt. Pelasgus faces a dilemma — protecting the suppliants risks war with Aegyptus's sons, but rejecting them would anger Zeus Hikesios (protector of suppliants). The Danaids threaten to hang themselves from the gods' statues. Pelasgus resolves to put the matter to the Argive assembly.
- **Second Stasimon (~524-599)**: The Chorus invokes Zeus's power and the precedent of Io's deliverance.
- **Third Episode (~600-624)**: Pelasgus departs for the assembly.
- **Third Stasimon (~625-709)**: The Chorus sings a hymn retelling Io's wanderings in detail — the gadfly's pursuit, her passage through many lands, Zeus's healing touch in Egypt, and the birth of Epaphus ("child of the Touch").
- **Fourth Episode (~710-775)**: Danaus returns with news: the Argive assembly has voted unanimously to protect the suppliants. "No force shall bear away the maiden band."
- **Fourth Stasimon (~776-824)**: The Chorus blesses Argos with prayers for prosperity, health, and peace, invoking Zeus, [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md), and [Ares](../deities/ares.md).
- **Fifth Episode (~825-910)**: Danaus spots the Egyptian ships approaching. The Chorus panics; Danaus calms them and leaves to fetch armed help. The Chorus sings of preferring death to forced marriage.
- **Herald Scene (~911-1013)**: The Herald of Aegyptus arrives and attempts to drag the Danaids from the altar by force. King Pelasgus intervenes, confronting the Herald: "No force shall bear away the maiden band." The Herald threatens war and departs.
- **Exodos (~1014-1073)**: Pelasgus offers the maidens lodging in the city. Danaus returns and advises chastity and modesty. The final chorus divides into semi-choruses: one honors [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md), Desire, Persuasion, and Harmonia; the other prays for deliverance from the forced marriage, invoking Io's precedent: "It was thou didst release mine ancestress Io from sorrow."
