## Overview

The *Phoenissae* is Euripides' treatment of the Theban saga, covering the civil war between [Oedipus](../heroes/oedipus.md)'s sons Eteocles and Polynices. [Jocasta](../heroes/jocasta.md), still alive in this version, opens the play with a long prologue tracing the curse from [Cadmus](../heroes/cadmus.md) through Laius, Oedipus, and the present generation. Polynices, exiled by Eteocles who refuses to share the throne, returns with an Argive army. Jocasta attempts to mediate but fails. [Tiresias](../heroes/tiresias.md) prophesies that [Creon](../heroes/creon.md)'s son Menoeceus must be sacrificed to [Ares](../deities/ares.md) at the lair of the dragon to save [Thebes](../places/thebes.md). Menoeceus willingly dies. The Argive assault fails (Capaneus struck by [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md)'s thunderbolt on the walls). The brothers kill each other in single combat. Jocasta kills herself over their bodies. Creon seizes power, refuses burial to Polynices, and banishes [Oedipus](../heroes/oedipus.md). [Antigone](../heroes/antigone.md) chooses exile with her father, vowing to bury Polynices secretly.

## Contents

### Prologue (1–87)
Jocasta traces the lineage from Cadmus (who married Harmonia, daughter of [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md)) through Polydorus, Labdacus, and Laius. Apollo's oracle warned Laius not to beget children. Oedipus was exposed on Cithaeron, raised by Polybus, killed his father at the crossroads in Phocis, solved the Sphinx's riddle, married his mother. After discovering the truth, Oedipus blinded himself. His sons locked him away; he cursed them to divide the house "with the sharpened sword."

### Teichoscopia (88–201)
Antigone surveys the Argive army from the walls with an old Tutor. They identify the Seven champions: Hippomedon, Tydeus, Parthenopaeus (son of Atalanta), Polynices, Amphiaraus, Capaneus, and Adrastus.

### Jocasta's Mediation (202–637)
Polynices enters the city under truce. Jocasta's reunion with her son includes a famous passage on exile: "What is the being deprived of one's country? A great ill... not to have the liberty of speaking." The oracle that Adrastus should marry his daughters to "a boar and a lion" brought Polynices and Tydeus to Argos. Eteocles refuses to yield the throne; Polynices demands his share; Jocasta's mediation fails.

### Tiresias's Prophecy and Menoeceus's Sacrifice (638–1066)
Tiresias prophesies that Creon's son Menoeceus must die at the dragon's cave as a libation to Ares, who "avenges the slaughter of the earth-born dragon" by Cadmus. Only one of the Sown Men's pure descendants can satisfy this. Creon tries to save his son, but Menoeceus volunteers and kills himself on the battlements.

### The Battle and Seven Champions (1067–1283)
A messenger describes the assault on the seven gates. Each champion bears a distinctive shield device. Capaneus scales the walls boasting that "not even the hallowed fire of Jove should hinder him" — Zeus strikes him with a thunderbolt, hurling his limbs apart. The Thebans rout the Argives.

### The Duel and Triple Death (1284–1581)
Eteocles and Polynices fight in single combat. Eteocles uses "a Thessalian stratagem" to wound Polynices through the navel. But Polynices, dying, drives his sword into Eteocles' heart. Both die. Jocasta finds their bodies, and "snatched the sword from the dead body, and perpetrated a deed of horror; for she drove the steel through the middle of her throat, and lies dead on those most dear to her."

### Creon's Decrees and Oedipus's Exile (1582–1766)
Creon seizes power. He decrees that Polynices shall be unburied, and banishes Oedipus (as Tiresias commanded). Antigone defies Creon, vowing to bury her brother. She rejects marriage to Haemon and chooses exile with Oedipus. Oedipus recalls Apollo's prophecy that he would die at "the sacred Colonus" in Athens.
