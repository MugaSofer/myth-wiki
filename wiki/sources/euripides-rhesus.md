## Overview

The *Rhesus* dramatises events parallel to [Iliad](iliad.md) Book X (the Doloneia), set during a single night in the Trojan camp. Its authorship is disputed — ancient sources attribute it to Euripides, but many modern scholars consider it the work of a later poet. The play focuses on the arrival of [Rhesus](../heroes/rhesus.md), king of Thrace, as a late ally of [Troy](../places/troy.md), and his murder that same night by [Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md) and [Diomedes](../heroes/diomedes.md), guided by [Athena](../deities/athena.md).

## Contents

### Hector and the Night Watch
The Chorus of Trojan sentinels rouses [Hector](../heroes/hector.md), reporting fires blazing throughout the Greek camp. Hector concludes the Greeks are preparing to flee and wants to attack immediately. [Aeneas](../heroes/aeneas.md) counsels caution: if the Greeks are not fleeing but laying a trap, an attack across the trenches at night could be disastrous. He advises sending a spy instead.

### Dolon's Mission
[Dolon](../heroes/dolon.md) volunteers to spy on the Greek fleet. Hector offers him rewards — a daughter of [Priam](../heroes/priam.md), gold, whatever he wants. Dolon refuses them all and asks instead for [Achilles](../heroes/achilles.md)' immortal horses, offspring of [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md)'s gift to [Peleus](../heroes/peleus.md). Hector agrees. Dolon describes his disguise: he will wear a wolf-skin over his body, fit his hands and legs to the beast's paws, and imitate a wolf's gait. He departs boasting he will bring back the heads of Odysseus or Diomedes.

### The Arrival of Rhesus
A Shepherd arrives with news: [Rhesus](../heroes/rhesus.md), king of Thrace, has come with a vast army. The Shepherd describes Rhesus in his chariot drawn by Thracian horses "whiter than snow," wearing a golden-beamed shield adorned with a brazen Gorgon. Hector is initially contemptuous — Rhesus arrives too late, after nine years of fighting — but is persuaded to receive him.

Rhesus arrives and exchanges harsh words with Hector. Hector rebukes him for his tardiness and for abandoning Troy to fight the Scythians instead. Rhesus defends himself — he was delayed by a Scythian invasion — and boasts that he will destroy the entire Greek army in a single day. The Chorus compares him to Mars himself: "A god, O Troy, e'en Mars himself, from Strymon's current sprung, and from the Muse."

### Odysseus and Diomedes
[Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md) and [Diomedes](../heroes/diomedes.md) infiltrate the Trojan camp, having already killed Dolon offstage and learned the watchword ("Apollo"). They find Hector's tent empty and consider returning, but [Athena](../deities/athena.md) appears and redirects them: Rhesus must be killed tonight, for if he survives to morning "nor Ajax, nor can Achilles hinder him from wasting the camp of Greece."

Athena tells them where Rhesus sleeps — separate from the Trojan troops, with his white horses beside him — and orders them to steal the horses too. She then disguises herself as [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md) to intercept [Paris](../heroes/paris.md), who has heard rumours of intruders. Speaking as Venus, she reassures Paris and sends him away.

### The Killing and Escape
Diomedes kills Rhesus and his guards while Odysseus takes the horses. The Trojan sentinels challenge them, but Odysseus gives the watchword "Apollo" and they are allowed to pass.

### The Charioteer's Accusation
Rhesus's wounded Charioteer wakes and describes the attack. He had dreamed of two wolves mounting the horses and lashing them forward. Waking, he found Rhesus dead, his own body wounded. He accuses Hector of murdering Rhesus for his horses — arguing no Greek could have found Rhesus's tent on his first night. Hector denies it: "Ulysses was the author of this deed."

### The Muse's Lament
Rhesus's mother, one of the [Muses](../deities/groups/muses.md), descends bearing her son's body. She laments his death and curses [Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md), [Diomedes](../heroes/diomedes.md), and [Helen](../heroes/helen.md). She reveals that she conceived Rhesus at the river [Strymon](../deities/strymon.md) after the Muses' contest with [Thamyris](../heroes/thamyris.md), whom they blinded for his blasphemy. She addresses Athena directly: "Think not, O Minerva, thou sole cause of my son's fate, that thou these watchful eyes hast 'scaped." She mentions [Orpheus](../heroes/orpheus.md) as Rhesus's kinsman, and the Muses' services to Athens through Orpheus and Musaeus.

She prophesies that Rhesus will not remain among the dead but will become a demigod: "from a man exalted to a god, restored to life, the priest of Bacchus, and of him who dwells beneath Pangeum's rock." She also foreshadows Achilles' death — "such an inevitable shaft is stored in Phoebus' quiver" — and warns Thetis that her offspring too shall die.
