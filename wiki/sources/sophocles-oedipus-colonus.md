## Overview

**Oedipus at Colonus** is Sophocles' last play, produced posthumously. The blind, exiled [Oedipus](../heroes/oedipus.md) arrives at Colonus near [Athens](../places/athens.md), discovers he has entered the sacred grove of the [Eumenides](../creatures/erinyes.md), and recognizes it as his destined resting place. [Theseus](../heroes/theseus.md), king of Athens, grants him protection. [Creon](../heroes/creon.md) attempts to seize Oedipus's daughters by force, and [Polyneices](../heroes/polyneices.md) comes seeking his father's blessing for war against [Thebes](../places/thebes.md). Oedipus curses both his sons and dies in a mysterious divine event witnessed only by Theseus.

## Contents

### Prologue (1-116)

Oedipus, led by [Antigone](../heroes/antigone.md), arrives at a rocky seat within a grove. A stranger warns them the ground is sacred to "the Maidens / Daughters of Darkness and mysterious Earth" — the Eumenides (39-40). Oedipus recognizes the place from [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md)'s oracle: "for when he foretold my many woes / He told me also of a resting-place, / After long years, in some land far remote — / A seat at the shrine of the Dread Goddesses" (87-90).

### Parodos and First Episode (117-509)

The Chorus of Colonus elders recoils upon learning Oedipus's identity. Oedipus defends himself: "in act I sinned not, all was done / Unwittingly" (267-268); "I slew a man who sought to take my life, / Pure in the eye of law, void of intent" (271-273). [Ismene](../heroes/ismene.md) arrives with news: the oracle now declares that whichever side possesses Oedipus's grave will prevail in the coming war between his sons. Eteocles holds Thebes; Polyneices marches from Argos. Creon will seek Oedipus's person without allowing him into Thebes proper.

### Second Episode (551-667)

[Theseus](../heroes/theseus.md) arrives and offers Oedipus refuge and citizenship. Oedipus promises that his buried body will be a blessing for Athens: "Then shall my sleeping and long-buried corpse, / Cold in death, drink their warm life-blood" (621-622) — a defense against future Theban invasion.

### Third Episode (720-1043)

Creon arrives with armed men, first trying persuasion, then seizing Antigone and Ismene by force. Theseus intervenes and rescues the daughters. Oedipus denounces Creon: "Thou comest to steal me, not to take me home" (783).

### Fourth Episode (1096-1210)

Polyneices arrives and pleads for his father's support. He describes his exile and the army of seven champions he has gathered against Thebes: [Amphiaraus](../heroes/amphiaraus.md), Tydeus, Eteoclus, Hippomedon, [Capaneus](../heroes/capaneus.md), Parthenopaeus, and himself. Oedipus curses both sons: "Thou shalt not sack that city, but shalt fall / Dabbled in blood, and so thy brother too" (1372-1373). He recalls their neglect: "Ye, when your sire was thrust from hearth and home, / Looked on in silence — yea, 'twas ye that drave me forth, / And ye that made me cityless" (1354-1356).

### Exodos (1447-1779)

Thunder sounds — [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md)'s summons. Oedipus calls for Theseus: "The peal of Zeus will lead me presently / To where I die" (1456-1457). Led now not by his daughters but guiding them, Oedipus walks toward the place of his death. A messenger reports: "He called his daughters and bade them bring / Lustral water from some fountain... / He washed and robed himself" (1598-1602). Then "a voice from god called him — a voice / That made all shudder" (1623-1624). Only Theseus witnessed the end: "whether he were rapt away by gods / Or the earth's base opened to receive him, / None may tell but Theseus" (1661-1663). [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md) and [Persephone](../deities/persephone.md) are invoked: "O thou nether goddess, and thou king / Of the unseen... Aidoneus, I pray thee, / Let this stranger pass thee without pain" (1556-1559).
