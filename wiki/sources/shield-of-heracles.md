## Overview

The **Shield of Heracles** is a narrative poem attributed to Hesiod, though its authorship was disputed even in antiquity. It tells the story of [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md)' battle against Cycnus, a son of [Ares](../deities/ares.md) who waylaid pilgrims heading to [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md)'s temple. The poem's centrepiece is an elaborate description of Heracles' shield, modelled on the Shield of Achilles in the [Iliad](iliad.md).

## Relationship to the Iliad

The shield ekphrasis is clearly modelled on the [Shield of Achilles](../objects/shield-of-achilles.md) in [Iliad](iliad.md) XVIII, sharing several motifs: a city at war, a city at peace, agricultural scenes, a chariot race, and Ocean flowing round the rim. However, the Shield of Heracles is darker in tone — its central figure is Fear, it features more violence and horror (the Fates drinking blood, Darkness of Death), and it includes mythological scenes (Perseus, the Lapiths) absent from Homer's version.
