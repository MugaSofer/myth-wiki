## Overview

The *Aeneid* is the foundational epic of Roman literature, telling the story of [Aeneas](../heroes/aeneas.md)'s journey from the fall of [Troy](../places/troy.md) to the founding of a new kingdom in Italy. It draws extensively on the Homeric tradition — Books I-VI parallel the [Odyssey](odyssey.md) (wanderings), Books VII-XII parallel the [Iliad](iliad.md) (war). The poem provides the most detailed surviving account of the fall of Troy (Book II), a major descent to the underworld (Book VI), and the divine politics behind Roman destiny.

The gods play active roles throughout, with [Juno](../deities/hera.md) opposing and [Venus](../deities/aphrodite.md) supporting Aeneas at every turn, while [Jupiter](../deities/zeus.md) holds the balance and guarantees Rome's fated supremacy.

## Contents

### Book I: The Storm and Carthage
[Juno](../deities/hera.md) enlists Aeolus to raise a storm against the Trojan fleet. [Neptune](../deities/poseidon.md) calms the sea. [Venus](../deities/aphrodite.md) appeals to [Jupiter](../deities/zeus.md), who prophesies Roman destiny. Venus appears to [Aeneas](../heroes/aeneas.md) disguised as a huntress and tells him Dido's story. Aeneas, hidden in a divine cloud, enters Carthage and reveals himself to Dido. Venus sends [Cupid](../deities/aphrodite.md) disguised as Ascanius to inflame Dido's love.
