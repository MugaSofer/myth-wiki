## Overview

The *Aeneid* is the foundational epic of Roman literature, telling the story of [Aeneas](../heroes/aeneas.md)'s journey from the fall of [Troy](../places/troy.md) to the founding of a new kingdom in Italy. It draws extensively on the Homeric tradition — Books I-VI parallel the [Odyssey](odyssey.md) (wanderings), Books VII-XII parallel the [Iliad](iliad.md) (war). The poem provides the most detailed surviving account of the fall of Troy (Book II), a major descent to the underworld (Book VI), and the divine politics behind Roman destiny.

The gods play active roles throughout, with [Juno](../deities/hera.md) opposing and [Venus](../deities/aphrodite.md) supporting Aeneas at every turn, while [Jupiter](../deities/zeus.md) holds the balance and guarantees Rome's fated supremacy.

## Contents

### Book I: The Storm and Carthage
[Juno](../deities/hera.md) enlists Aeolus to raise a storm against the Trojan fleet. [Neptune](../deities/poseidon.md) calms the sea. [Venus](../deities/aphrodite.md) appeals to [Jupiter](../deities/zeus.md), who prophesies Roman destiny. Venus appears to [Aeneas](../heroes/aeneas.md) disguised as a huntress and tells him Dido's story. Aeneas, hidden in a divine cloud, enters Carthage and reveals himself to Dido. Venus sends [Cupid](../deities/aphrodite.md) disguised as Ascanius to inflame Dido's love.

### Book II: The Fall of Troy
[Aeneas](../heroes/aeneas.md) narrates Troy's destruction to Dido's court. The Greeks leave the wooden horse; Sinon deceives the Trojans with a false story. Laocoön warns against the horse ("I fear the Grecians even when they offer gifts") but is killed with his sons by two sea-serpents. Hector's ghost appears to Aeneas and commends the household gods to his care. Troy falls in the night; Aeneas fights through the burning city. Neoptolemus (Pyrrhus) kills [Priam](../heroes/priam.md) at his own altar. [Venus](../deities/aphrodite.md) appears to Aeneas in her true divine form and reveals the gods destroying Troy. Aeneas carries Anchises on his shoulders, leads Iülus by the hand, but loses his wife Creüsa in the confusion; her ghost prophesies his future in Italy.

### Book III: The Wanderings
[Aeneas](../heroes/aeneas.md) continues his narration. In Thrace, he discovers the bleeding grave of Polydorus, [Priam](../heroes/priam.md)'s son murdered for gold. At Delos, [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md)'s oracle counsels "seek out your ancient mother." Anchises misinterprets this as Crete, but the household gods appear in a vision redirecting them to Italy (Hesperia). At the Strophades, the [Harpies](../creatures/harpies.md) defile their feast; Celaeno prophesies they will eat their tables. At Buthrotum, they find Helenus and Andromache ruling a miniature Troy. Helenus prophesies the route to Italy, warns of [Scylla](../creatures/scylla.md) and Charybdis, and foretells the Sibyl. They pass the [Cyclopes](../creatures/cyclopes.md)' coast and rescue Achemenides, a Greek left behind by Odysseus. Anchises dies at Drepanum.

### Book IV: Dido's Love and Death
[Dido](../heroes/dido.md) confesses her love for [Aeneas](../heroes/aeneas.md) to her sister Anna. [Juno](../deities/hera.md) and [Venus](../deities/aphrodite.md) conspire to unite them in a cave during a hunt. Rumour (Fama) spreads the news. King Iarbas complains to [Jupiter](../deities/zeus.md), who sends [Mercury](../deities/hermes.md) to command Aeneas to leave. Dido discovers his plans; her speeches of anguish and fury. Aeneas departs. Dido curses Rome and Carthage to eternal enmity ("unnamed avenger"), mounts a funeral pyre, and falls on Aeneas's sword. [Juno](../deities/hera.md) sends Iris to release her soul.

### Book V: The Funeral Games
[Aeneas](../heroes/aeneas.md) holds funeral games for Anchises in Sicily: ship race, foot race, boxing, archery, and cavalry display. [Juno](../deities/hera.md) sends Iris disguised as Beroë to incite the Trojan women to burn the ships; [Jupiter](../deities/zeus.md) sends rain to save them, though four are lost. Anchises' ghost appears and commands Aeneas to visit the underworld via the Sibyl. [Venus](../deities/aphrodite.md) appeals to [Neptune](../deities/poseidon.md) for safe passage; Neptune promises it at the cost of one life. Sleep (Somnus) drowns the helmsman Palinurus.

### Book VI: The Underworld
[Aeneas](../heroes/aeneas.md) reaches Cumae and consults the Sibyl (Deiphobe, priestess of [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) and [Hecate](../deities/hecate.md)). She prophesies wars in Italy. He requests passage to the underworld; she requires the golden bough, sacred to [Proserpine](../deities/persephone.md). After burying Misenus, they descend. They pass the Vestibule of personified evils, cross the Styx via Charon (subduing Cerberus with drugged cake), enter the Wailing Fields where [Dido](../heroes/dido.md) turns away in silence. They see Tartarus — the Titans, Tityos, Ixion, Rhadamanthus judging, Tisiphone guarding — then enter Elysium. Anchises explains the cycle of reincarnation and shows a parade of future Roman heroes, from Silvius through Augustus. Aeneas departs by the ivory gate of false dreams.
