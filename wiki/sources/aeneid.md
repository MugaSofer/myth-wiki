## Overview

The *Aeneid* is the foundational epic of Roman literature, telling the story of [Aeneas](../heroes/aeneas.md)'s journey from the fall of [Troy](../places/troy.md) to the founding of a new kingdom in Italy. It draws extensively on the Homeric tradition — Books I-VI parallel the [Odyssey](odyssey.md) (wanderings), Books VII-XII parallel the [Iliad](iliad.md) (war). The poem provides the most detailed surviving account of the fall of Troy (Book II), a major descent to the underworld (Book VI), and the divine politics behind Roman destiny.

The gods play active roles throughout, with [Juno](../deities/hera.md) opposing and [Venus](../deities/aphrodite.md) supporting Aeneas at every turn, while [Jupiter](../deities/zeus.md) holds the balance and guarantees Rome's fated supremacy.

## Contents

### Book I: The Storm and Carthage
[Juno](../deities/hera.md) enlists Aeolus to raise a storm against the Trojan fleet. [Neptune](../deities/poseidon.md) calms the sea. [Venus](../deities/aphrodite.md) appeals to [Jupiter](../deities/zeus.md), who prophesies Roman destiny. Venus appears to [Aeneas](../heroes/aeneas.md) disguised as a huntress and tells him Dido's story. Aeneas, hidden in a divine cloud, enters Carthage and reveals himself to Dido. Venus sends [Cupid](../deities/aphrodite.md) disguised as Ascanius to inflame Dido's love.

### Book II: The Fall of Troy
[Aeneas](../heroes/aeneas.md) narrates Troy's destruction to Dido's court. The Greeks leave the wooden horse; Sinon deceives the Trojans with a false story. Laocoön warns against the horse ("I fear the Grecians even when they offer gifts") but is killed with his sons by two sea-serpents. Hector's ghost appears to Aeneas and commends the household gods to his care. Troy falls in the night; Aeneas fights through the burning city. Neoptolemus (Pyrrhus) kills [Priam](../heroes/priam.md) at his own altar. [Venus](../deities/aphrodite.md) appears to Aeneas in her true divine form and reveals the gods destroying Troy. Aeneas carries Anchises on his shoulders, leads Iülus by the hand, but loses his wife Creüsa in the confusion; her ghost prophesies his future in Italy.
