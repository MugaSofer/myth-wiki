## Overview

**Trojan Women** (*Troades*) is a tragedy by Euripides produced in 415 BCE. It dramatises the immediate aftermath of Troy's fall: the captive women learn their assigned Greek masters, each scene bringing new devastation. The play has almost no plot in the conventional sense — it is, as Murray writes, "the crying of one of the great wrongs of the world wrought into music." [Hecuba](../heroes/hecuba.md) is the central figure, enduring blow after blow: [Cassandra](../heroes/cassandra.md) taken as [Agamemnon](../heroes/agamemnon.md)'s concubine, [Polyxena](../heroes/polyxena.md) already sacrificed at [Achilles'](../heroes/achilles.md) tomb, [Andromache](../heroes/andromache.md) given to [Neoptolemus](../heroes/neoptolemus.md), and her grandson [Astyanax](../heroes/astyanax.md) hurled from the walls. [Helen](../heroes/helen.md) stands trial before [Menelaus](../heroes/menelaus.md), and the city is burned.

The prologue features [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) and [Athena](../deities/athena.md), former enemies in the Trojan War, now allied to punish the Greeks for their sacrilege — particularly Ajax's violation of Cassandra in Athena's temple.

## Contents

### Prologue (Poseidon and Athena)

[Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) stands before the ruined walls of [Troy](../places/troy.md), the city he and [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) built. He describes the aftermath: Priam lies unburied at the altar, the captive women are portioned by lot, [Helen](../heroes/helen.md) is held as a prisoner. He notes that [Polyxena](../heroes/polyxena.md) "lies bleeding" at [Achilles'](../heroes/achilles.md) grave, secretly slain, and that [Cassandra](../heroes/cassandra.md), whom Apollo spared as his virgin, will be taken by force to [Agamemnon](../heroes/agamemnon.md)'s bed.

[Athena](../deities/athena.md) appears and proposes an alliance: she who helped destroy Troy now seeks to punish the Greeks for their sacrilege against her — Ajax cast Cassandra down in her holy place, and no Greek raised a hand against him. Poseidon agrees. Athena promises storms sent by [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md): "Zeus shall send rain, long rain and flaw of driven hail, and a whirling darkness blown from heaven." Poseidon will make the seas wild. The prologue ends with Poseidon's famous warning: "How are ye blind, ye treaders down of cities, ye that cast temples to desolation, and lay waste tombs, the untrodden sanctuaries where lie the ancient dead; yourselves so soon to die!"

### Hecuba's Awakening

[Hecuba](../heroes/hecuba.md) wakes on the ground before the Greek ships. She was queen of Troy; now she is "a winter-frozen bee, a slave death-shapen." She calls the other captive women from their huts.

### The Lots (Talthybius)

The herald Talthybius arrives to announce the lots. Cassandra goes to Agamemnon as his concubine. Polyxena "rests apart, to watch Achilles' tomb" — Talthybius euphemistically says "count thy maid happy," concealing that she has been sacrificed. [Andromache](../heroes/andromache.md) goes to [Neoptolemus](../heroes/neoptolemus.md) (Pyrrhus). Hecuba herself falls to [Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md): "a lying man and a pitiless shall be lord of me."

### Cassandra's Prophecy

[Cassandra](../heroes/cassandra.md) enters bearing a torch, dressed as a bride, singing wildly of her wedding to Agamemnon. In her prophetic madness she declares herself "a bloodier bride than ever Helen was" — she will kill Agamemnon and lay waste his house. She prophesies the fall of the House of Atreus: "the axe that craveth me, and more than me... the dark wanderings of mother-murder that my bridal brings, and all the House of Atreus down, down, down."

She also delivers a striking argument that Troy's dead are happier than the Greek victors: the Trojans died defending their homeland, tended by their families; the Greeks died far from home for "a woman, a thing abhorred." She foresees Odysseus's ten years of suffering: "till all these tears of ours and harrowings of Troy, by his, shall be as golden things. Ten years behind ten years athwart his way."

### Andromache and the Death of Astyanax

[Andromache](../heroes/andromache.md) arrives on a chariot heaped with spoils, holding her son [Astyanax](../heroes/astyanax.md). She tells Hecuba that Polyxena "across Achilles' tomb lies slain, a gift flung to the dreamless dead." She delivers a long speech about her own virtue as a wife — her silence, her modesty, her devotion to [Hector](../heroes/hector.md) — and how that very reputation has marked her as a prize for Neoptolemus.

Talthybius returns with devastating news: by Odysseus's counsel, Astyanax must die — "the son of one so perilous be not fostered on to manhood" — and must be hurled from Troy's walls. Andromache's farewell to her child is one of the play's most harrowing scenes: "Go, die, my best-beloved, my cherished one, in fierce men's hands, leaving me here alone. Thy father was too valiant; that is why they slay thee!"

### The Trial of Helen

[Menelaus](../heroes/menelaus.md) arrives to claim [Helen](../heroes/helen.md). Hecuba urges him to kill her but warns: "fear to see her visage, lest she snare thee." Helen defends herself: she blames [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md)'s irresistible power, the Judgement of [Paris](../heroes/paris.md), and her own helplessness. She claims she tried repeatedly to escape from Troy.

Hecuba demolishes every argument: the goddesses would not have bartered their cities for vanity on Ida; Helen's own desire was the "Aphrodite" that drove her; she never cried for help in Sparta, never attempted escape in earnest, and dressed in finery rather than mourning. Menelaus declares Helen will die — but Hecuba warns he must not let her aboard his ship: "a lover once, will alway love again." Menelaus agrees to separate ships, though his resolve already wavers.

### The Burial of Astyanax

Talthybius returns bearing the dead child on [Hector](../heroes/hector.md)'s great shield. [Andromache](../heroes/andromache.md), already taken to the ships, has asked that the shield serve as her son's coffin. Hecuba prepares the tiny body, lamenting: "There lieth here a babe whom the Greeks feared, and in their fear slew him."

### The Burning of Troy

As the city is set ablaze, Hecuba tries to throw herself into the flames but is restrained. The women depart for the ships as Troy collapses: "The dust as smoke riseth; it spreadeth wide its wing; it maketh me as a shadow, and my City a vanished thing!"
