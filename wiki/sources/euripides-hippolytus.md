## Overview

The *Hippolytus* is a tragedy by Euripides, first performed in 428 BCE (winning first prize). It dramatises [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md)'s revenge on Hippolytus, son of [Theseus](../heroes/theseus.md) and the Amazon Hippolyta, for his refusal to worship her and his exclusive devotion to [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md). Aphrodite causes Phaedra, Theseus's wife, to fall in love with her stepson. When the secret is exposed and Phaedra kills herself, leaving a false accusation, Theseus invokes [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md)'s gift of three curses against his innocent son.

This is the surviving second version of the play (known as *Hippolytus Stephanias*, "the garland-bearing"), which replaced an earlier, scandalous version.

## Contents

### Prologue (1-57)

[Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md) (Venus) delivers the prologue, declaring that Hippolytus "says that I am of deities the vilest, and rejects the bridal bed" while honouring [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md) as the greatest of deities. She has struck Phaedra with love for Hippolytus as her instrument of revenge, and reveals [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md)'s gift to Theseus: "Neptune, king of the ocean, granted as a privilege to Theseus, that he should make no prayer thrice to the God in vain." She acknowledges Phaedra will die as collateral: "I will not make her ills of that high consequence, that will hinder my enemies from giving me such full vengeance as may content me."

### Hippolytus and the Garland (58-120)

Hippolytus enters with his attendants, singing hymns to Artemis. He offers her a woven garland from a pure meadow "where neither does the shepherd think fit to feed his flocks, nor yet came iron there." An attendant warns him not to neglect Aphrodite, but Hippolytus dismisses her.

### Phaedra's Confession (170-524)

The Chorus of Troezenian women speculate about Phaedra's mysterious illness. Phaedra, wasting away, eventually confesses to her Nurse. She places herself in a line of women cursed in love: "O wretched mother, what a love didst thou love!" (Pasiphae and the bull), "Thou, too, O wretched sister, wife of Bacchus!" ([Ariadne](../heroes/ariadne.md)), "And I the third, how unhappily I perish!"

### The Nurse's Betrayal and Phaedra's Death (525-775)

The Nurse, meaning to help, reveals Phaedra's love to Hippolytus. He responds with a tirade against women. Phaedra, hearing his reaction, resolves to die and writes a tablet falsely accusing Hippolytus of assault.

### Theseus's Curse (776-898)

[Theseus](../heroes/theseus.md) returns to find Phaedra dead and the accusatory tablet. He invokes Poseidon's curse: "O father Neptune, by one of these three curses, which thou formerly didst promise me, by one of those destroy my son, and let him not escape beyond this day."

### Hippolytus's Defense and Exile (899-1101)

Hippolytus protests his innocence but is bound by an oath not to reveal the truth. Theseus banishes him.

### The Messenger: The Bull from the Sea (1153-1267)

A Messenger reports Hippolytus's destruction. On the shore, "a vast wave pillared in heaven" rose from the sea, and "the wave sent forth a bull, a fierce monster; with whose bellowing the whole land filled resounded fearfully." The bull pursued Hippolytus's chariot, terrifying the horses, until he was entangled in the reins and dragged to his death.

### Artemis's Revelation (1283-1439)

[Artemis](../deities/artemis.md) (Diana) appears in person and reveals the full truth to Theseus. She explains the divine law that prevents gods from opposing one another: "None wishes to thwart the purpose of him that wills anything; but we always stand aloof." She promises to avenge Hippolytus by destroying one of Aphrodite's favourites: "with these inevitable weapons from mine own hand will I revenge me on another, whoever to her be the dearest of mortals." She also institutes a cult: "the unwedded virgins before their nuptials shall shear their locks to thee for many an age."

### Hippolytus's Death (1440-1466)

Hippolytus, brought in dying, recognises Artemis by her divine perfume. He observes: "One Venus hath destroyed us three" — himself, Phaedra, and Theseus. At Artemis's urging he forgives his father, invoking Diana as witness, and dies.
