## Overview

The **Bibliotheca** (or **Library**) is a comprehensive handbook of Greek mythology, systematically organized by divine and heroic genealogies. Though traditionally attributed to Apollodorus of Athens (2nd century BCE), the work dates to the 1st or 2nd century CE.

The text is uniquely valuable for preserving variant traditions and citing earlier sources by name (Hesiod, Pherecydes, Acusilaus, Panyasis, and others). It covers the entire sweep of Greek myth from the creation to the returns of the heroes from Troy.

- **Book 1**: Cosmogony, Titans, Zeus's consorts and offspring, Apollo and Artemis, Demeter and Persephone, Gigantomachy, Typhon, Prometheus, Deucalion's flood, descendants of Aeolus (including Calydonian Boar and the Argonauts)
- **Book 2**: Family of Inachus — Argos, Io, Danaus, Perseus, Heracles (labours and campaigns)
- **Book 3**: Family of Agenor — Europa, Cadmus, Thebes, Oedipus, Dionysos, Minos, Crete, Theseus (partial)

## Translation Notes

Frazer's translation uses English/Roman equivalents for many divine names:
- **Sky** = Uranus; **Earth** = Gaia; **Sea/Pontus** = Pontos
- **Pluto** = Hades; **The Maid/Maiden** = Persephone
- **Hercules** = Heracles; **Ulysses** = Odysseus
- **Dawn** = Eos; **Sun** = Helius; **Moon** = Selene
- **Furies** = Erinyes; **Victory** = Nike

Citations use the standard section numbering: e.g., Bibliotheca 1.6.2, Epitome 1.1.
