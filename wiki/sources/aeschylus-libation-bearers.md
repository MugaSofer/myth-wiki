## Overview

The *Libation-Bearers* (Greek: *Choephoroe*) is the second play of the Oresteia trilogy. It dramatizes [Orestes](../heroes/orestes.md)' return from exile to avenge his father [Agamemnon](../heroes/agamemnon.md)'s murder by slaying [Clytemnestra](../heroes/clytemnestra.md) and [Aegisthus](../heroes/aegisthus.md). The title refers to the Chorus of captive women who bear libations to Agamemnon's tomb, sent by Clytemnestra after a terrifying dream.

## Contents

### Prologue (~1-21)
[Orestes](../heroes/orestes.md) arrives at his father's tomb in [Argos](../places/argos.md) with his companion [Pylades](../heroes/pylades.md). He dedicates two locks of hair—one to the river Inachus, one to his father's grave—and prays for vengeance.

### Parodos (~22-83)
The Chorus of captive women enters bearing libations, sent by Clytemnestra after a nightmare. They describe the dream-terror that drove the queen to this act and lament the state of the house.

### First Episode (~84-263)
[Electra](../heroes/electra.md) arrives with the Chorus, uncertain how to pour the offerings. The Chorus counsels her to pray for Orestes' return and for vengeance on the killers. Electra discovers Orestes' lock of hair and footprints at the tomb. Orestes reveals himself, proving his identity by the hair, footprints, and a robe Electra once wove for him.

### The Kommos (~264-478)
Orestes, Electra, and the Chorus perform an extended invocation at Agamemnon's tomb, calling on his spirit to aid their cause. This great lyric passage invokes the dead king's honour, laments his shameful burial, and appeals to [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md), Earth, and the powers of the underworld.

### Second Episode (~479-584)
Orestes reveals [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md)'s oracle: if he fails to avenge his father, he will suffer disease, madness, and pursuit by the [Furies](../creatures/erinyes.md). The Chorus reveals Clytemnestra's dream—she bore a serpent, swaddled and nursed it, and it drew blood with her milk. Orestes interprets himself as that serpent. He outlines his plan: he and Pylades will pose as Phocian travelers bringing news of Orestes' death.

### First Stasimon (~585-652)
The Chorus sings of monstrous women: Althaea who burned the brand that was her son Meleager's life, Scylla who cut her father Nisus' immortal lock, and the women of Lemnos who murdered their husbands.

### Third Episode (~653-718)
Orestes arrives at the palace in disguise, announces that "Orestes is dead," and is welcomed by Clytemnestra as a guest.

### Second Stasimon (~719-773)
The Chorus prays for success and anticipates the moment of action.

### Fourth Episode (~774-837)
The Nurse Kilissa is sent to fetch Aegisthus. She delivers a touching speech about raising the infant Orestes. The Chorus persuades her to alter the message so Aegisthus comes without his bodyguard.

### Third Stasimon (~838-868)
The Chorus invokes Zeus, Apollo, and [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md), praying for Orestes' victory. They invoke the spirit of Perseus.

### Fifth Episode (~869-934)
[Aegisthus](../heroes/aegisthus.md) arrives and enters the palace; his death-cry is heard offstage. [Clytemnestra](../heroes/clytemnestra.md) confronts Orestes. She bares her breast and pleads: "this breast pillowed thine head." Orestes hesitates; [Pylades](../heroes/pylades.md) speaks his only lines in the play: "Where then would fall the hest Apollo gave at Delphi?" Orestes drives Clytemnestra inside and kills her.

### Exodos (~935-1076)
Orestes stands over the bodies, displaying the murder-robe used to kill Agamemnon. He justifies his deed but immediately begins to lose his grip on sanity. He sees the [Furies](../creatures/erinyes.md)—"Gorgon shapes" with snakes for hair, black-robed, dripping blood from their eyes—visible only to him. He flees to [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md)'s shrine at [Delphi](../places/delphi.md). The Chorus reflects on the three storms that have struck the house of Atreus: the feast of Thyestes, the murder of Agamemnon, and now this.
