## Overview

The *Alcestis* was the fourth play in Euripides' tetralogy of 438 BCE (taking the place normally reserved for a satyr play). It tells the story of Alcestis, wife of King Admetus of Pherae, who volunteers to die in her husband's place after his parents refuse. [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md), who once served as Admetus's herdsman, had earlier persuaded the Fates to allow a substitute death. [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md), arriving as a guest during the mourning, learns the truth and wrestles Death at the tomb to bring Alcestis back.

## Contents

### Prologue: Apollo and Death (1-76)

[Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) recounts how [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) killed his son [Asclepius](../deities/asclepius.md) with a thunderbolt for raising the dead: "Jove was the cause, by slaying my son Æsculapius, hurling the lightning against his breast." In revenge Apollo killed the Cyclopes, and was punished with servitude: "me my father compelled to serve for hire with a mortal." He found Admetus pious and "deluded the Fates" to allow a substitute death. Death (Thanatos) enters with a sword to claim Alcestis. The two argue — Apollo pleads for delay, Death insists on his due. Apollo prophesies that a man sent by Eurystheus (Heracles) will take Alcestis back by force.

### Alcestis's Death (77-434)

The Chorus of Pheraeans speculates about Alcestis's condition. The Chorus recalls [Asclepius](../deities/asclepius.md): "only if the son of Phoebus were viewing with his eyes this light, could she come, having left the darksome habitations and the gates of Pluto: for he raised up the dead." In her final moments, Alcestis has a vision of the underworld: "I see the two-oared boat—and the ferryman of the dead, holding his hand on the pole—Charon even now calls me" and "the winged Pluto, staring from beneath his black eyebrows." She extracts a promise from Admetus never to remarry.

### Heracles Arrives (476-567)

[Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) arrives on his way to capture the man-eating horses of Diomedes the Thracian (his eighth labour for Eurystheus). The Chorus tells him the horses' owner is "of Mars" and that "they tear men piecemeal with their devouring jaws." Heracles is undaunted: "none there is, who shall ever see the son of Alcmena fearing the hand of his enemies." Admetus conceals his wife's death and insists on hosting Heracles, a supreme act of hospitality even in grief.

### Pheres and Admetus (614-740)

Admetus's father Pheres arrives with funeral gifts and is met with a bitter denunciation — Admetus accuses his parents of cowardice for refusing to die. Pheres fires back that Admetus himself killed his wife by accepting the substitute.

### Heracles Learns the Truth (747-860)

A servant reveals to the feasting Heracles that the dead woman is Alcestis. Heracles, ashamed, resolves to rescue her: "I must rescue the woman lately dead... going I will lay wait for the sable-vested king of the departed, Death, and I think that I shall find him drinking of the libations near the tomb." He plans to seize Death in his arms and not release him until Alcestis is freed.

### The Chorus on Necessity (962-1005)

The Chorus sings of Ananke (Necessity): "I have found nothing more powerful than Necessity: nor is there any cure in the Thracian tablets which Orpheus wrote, nor among those medicines, which Phoebus gave the sons of Æsculapius." They declare that Necessity has no altar and hears no victims.

### The Return (1006-1163)

Heracles returns with a veiled woman he claims to have won as a wrestling prize. He gradually coaxes Admetus to accept her. When the veil is removed, it is Alcestis. Heracles explains: "Having fought a battle with the prince of those beneath... At the tomb itself, having seized him from ambush with my hands." Alcestis cannot speak until the third day, when her consecration to the gods below is dissolved.
