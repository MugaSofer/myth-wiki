## Overview

The *Seven Against Thebes* dramatizes the final hours of the siege of [Thebes](../places/thebes.md) by the Argive army. [Eteocles](../heroes/eteocles.md), son of [Oedipus](../heroes/oedipus.md), commands the defense and assigns a champion to each of the city's seven gates to meet the seven Argive attackers. The play's central set-piece is the shield scene: a spy describes each attacker's shield device and boast, and Eteocles names the defender. At the seventh gate, Eteocles learns that his own brother [Polynices](../heroes/polyneices.md) stands there, and despite the Chorus's pleading, goes to meet him — fulfilling their father's curse that they would divide their inheritance by the sword. Both brothers die. The play ends with [Antigone](../heroes/antigone.md) and [Ismene](../heroes/ismene.md) mourning over the bodies, and Antigone's defiance of the herald's edict against burying Polynices.

The play was the third in a connected trilogy (preceded by *Laius* and *Oedipus*, both lost), and won first prize at the Dionysia.

## Contents

- **Prologue (~1-77)**: Eteocles rallies the people of Thebes. A spy reports that seven Argive champions have sworn in blood to sack the city or die.
- **Parodos (~78-181)**: The Chorus of Cadmean maidens panics at the sound of the approaching army. They invoke Zeus, Ares, Athena, Poseidon, Aphrodite, Apollo, and Artemis.
- **First Episode (~182-286)**: Eteocles berates the Chorus for their panic: "Where womankind has power, no man can house." He orders them to pray in silence.
- **First Stasimon (~287-368)**: The Chorus imagines the horrors of a sacked city — fire, slavery, rape.
- **Second Episode / Shield Scene (~369-676)**: The play's dramatic core. The spy describes each of the seven Argive champions — their shield devices, boasts, and character — and Eteocles names a Theban defender for each gate. At the seventh gate, learning Polynices is his opponent, Eteocles accepts fate despite the Chorus's pleas.
- **Second Stasimon (~677-791)**: The Chorus sings of the curse on the house of Laius: Apollo warned him three times to die childless; Oedipus's parricide and incest; Oedipus's curse on his sons.
- **Third Episode (~792-821)**: The spy returns. The city is saved — but the brothers have killed each other: "the earth has drunk blood of twin princes, by each other slain."
- **Kommos (~822-960)**: Antigone and Ismene, with the Chorus, mourn over the bodies. "Each in the left side smitten, see them laid — the children of one womb, slain by a mutual doom."
- **Exodos (~961-1078)**: A herald announces that Eteocles shall be buried with honor but Polynices cast out unburied. Antigone defies the edict: "I, I will bury this my brother's corse and risk your wrath." The Chorus divides, half following each sister.
