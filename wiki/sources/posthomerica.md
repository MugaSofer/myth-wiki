## Overview

The *Posthomerica* (also known as *The Fall of Troy*) fills the narrative gap between Homer's [Iliad](iliad.md) and [Odyssey](odyssey.md), covering the final events of the [Trojan War](../events/trojan-war.md): the coming and death of [Penthesilea](../heroes/penthesilea.md) and Memnon, the death of [Achilles](../heroes/achilles.md), the contest for his arms and [Ajax](../heroes/ajax.md)'s suicide, the fetching of [Neoptolemus](../heroes/neoptolemus.md) and [Philoctetes](../heroes/philoctetes.md), the Wooden Horse, the sack of Troy, and the disastrous Greek departure. Quintus explicitly modelled his work on Homer and claimed to have begun composing poetry while shepherding near Smyrna.

## Contents

### Book I: Penthesilea

[Penthesilea](../heroes/penthesilea.md), daughter of [Ares](../deities/ares.md), comes to Troy from the Thermodon with twelve Amazon companions, fleeing pollution for having accidentally killed her sister [Hippolyte](../heroes/hippolyte.md). [Priam](../heroes/priam.md) welcomes her; she promises to kill [Achilles](../heroes/achilles.md). [Athena](../deities/athena.md) sends a deceitful dream encouraging her. She arms in splendid armour given by Ares and routs the Greeks while Achilles and Ajax mourn at [Patroclus](../heroes/patroclus.md)' tomb. The Trojan women, inspired by Tisiphone's speech, nearly join the battle but are dissuaded by Theano. Achilles and Ajax finally enter the fight and turn the tide. Penthesilea's spears shatter against Achilles' divine armour. He kills her with one thrust through horse and rider. Removing her helmet, he is struck with remorse at her beauty — [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md) caused this by design. Thersites mocks him; Achilles kills Thersites with a single blow. [Diomedes](../heroes/diomedes.md) nearly fights Achilles over the killing (Thersites was his kinsman). Priam buries Penthesilea with honour beside Laomedon's tomb. [Ares](../deities/ares.md) swoops from Olympus to avenge his daughter but is turned back by [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md)'s thunderbolts.

### Book II: Memnon

Thymoetes despairs and urges the Trojans to flee or submit, but [Priam](../heroes/priam.md) counsels waiting for [Memnon](../heroes/memnon.md), son of [Eos](../deities/eos.md) (Dawn), who is coming with a vast Aethiopian host. Polydamas wisely suggests returning [Helen](../heroes/helen.md) and paying double restitution, but [Paris](../heroes/paris.md) reviles him and silences the assembly. Memnon arrives — giantlike, with a countless host. [Priam](../heroes/priam.md) feasts him and pledges him a golden cup (an heirloom from [Hephaestus](../deities/hephaestus.md) through [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md), Dardanus, Erichthonius, Tros, Ilus, and Laomedon). Memnon modestly declines to boast, saying battle will prove his worth. On Olympus, Zeus warns the gods that many will die and none should petition him. At dawn, battle is joined. [Achilles](../heroes/achilles.md) and Memnon both slaughter foes. Memnon kills [Antilochus](../heroes/antilochus.md), son of [Nestor](../heroes/nestor.md), above the breast. Nestor challenges Memnon but is spared — Memnon reverences his age. Nestor summons Achilles, who confronts Memnon. They exchange long boasts (Memnon claiming Dawn's superiority over [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md), Achilles defending Thetis' honour). They fight with swords, both using Hephaestus-forged shields; the Fates appear — one dark beside Memnon, one bright beside Achilles. Achilles drives his sword beneath Memnon's breastbone. The Winds (Breathings of the Dawn) carry Memnon's body to the stream of Aesopus; his blood drops become a river that turns to blood once a year. [Eos](../deities/eos.md) descends with the twelve Horae and the Pleiads to mourn. She threatens to stop bringing light; Zeus thunders to compel her. The Aethiopians are transformed into birds ("the Memnons") that still fight around his tomb. Dawn resumes her course.

### Book III: Death of Achilles

After [Antilochus](../heroes/antilochus.md)' burial, [Achilles](../heroes/achilles.md) arms for vengeance and drives the Trojans to their walls. [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) descends and commands him to withdraw: "Back from the Trojans, Peleus' son!" Achilles defies the god. Apollo, wrapping himself in cloud, shoots an arrow that strikes Achilles' ankle. He reels and falls "like a tower" but continues to fight, killing Orythaon, Hipponous, and Alcathous even as his strength fails. Standing on his spear, he shouts a last defiance; then falls "as fails a beetling mountain-cliff." [Paris](../heroes/paris.md) urges the Trojans to seize the body for Hector's horses. [Ajax](../heroes/ajax.md) bestrides the corpse and fights off Glaucus, [Aeneas](../heroes/aeneas.md), Agenor, and others; he kills Glaucus over Achilles' body. [Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md) fights beside him. Ajax routs the entire Trojan host back to the walls. [Hera](../deities/hera.md) upbraids Apollo for killing the son of [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md), reminding him he sang at Peleus' wedding and prayed for the child. [Athena](../deities/athena.md) preserves the body with ambrosia, giving it a stern frown like the living Achilles. Briseis laments him as her lord and protector. The [Nereids](../deities/groups/nymphs.md) rise from the sea; the [Muses](../deities/groups/muses.md) come from Helicon. Thetis clasps the body, threatening to go to Zeus. Calliope consoles her: even her son Orpheus died; Fate spares no one; but minstrels shall sing Achilles' glory forever. The pyre is built from Ida's timber; Zeus rains ambrosia; Hermes summons the Winds from Aeolus. The bones, unmistakable and gigantic, are placed in a silver casket inside a golden vase (gift of [Dionysus](../deities/dionysus.md), wrought by Hephaestus). A barrow is raised at the Hellespont. Achilles' immortal horses (born of Podarge and the West Wind) mourn but stay, fated to serve [Neoptolemus](../heroes/neoptolemus.md) next. [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) rises and consoles Thetis: Achilles will not stay in Hades but dwell with the gods; Poseidon will give him a holy island in the Euxine Sea.

### Book IV: Funeral Games of Achilles

[Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) catches Glaucus' body from his pyre and sends the Winds to carry him to Lycia, where nymphs create a spring called Glaucus. The Trojans rejoice at Achilles' death; the Argives mourn. [Hera](../deities/hera.md) rebukes [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) for helping Troy; Zeus sits brooding, planning both Troy's destruction and the Greeks' disastrous return. [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md) rises from the sea to set funeral games. [Nestor](../heroes/nestor.md) sings of Peleus' wedding and Achilles' deeds — wins horses that Telephus had given Achilles. Events: footrace (Locrian [Ajax](../heroes/ajax.md) defeats Teucer), wrestling ([Diomedes](../heroes/diomedes.md) defeats [Ajax](../heroes/ajax.md) son of Telamon by craft), boxing (Idomeneus defeats Thoas), archery (Teucer defeats Meriones), javelin (Agamemnon wins by consent), discus ([Ajax](../heroes/ajax.md) wins), and others. Thetis then sets down Achilles' divine arms as the final prize for whoever best rescued the body.

### Book V: Madness and Death of Ajax

[Ajax](../heroes/ajax.md) and [Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md) both claim [Achilles](../heroes/achilles.md)' arms. [Nestor](../heroes/nestor.md) advises against judging themselves, proposing Trojan captives as impartial judges — "they will pass true judgment on these twain, to neither showing favour, since they hate alike all authors of their misery." Ajax makes a passionate speech claiming superiority in battle: he stood against Hector, he saved the ships, he bore Achilles' body while Odysseus cowered. Odysseus counters with wit: brute strength alone does not win wars; his counsel captured Troy's allies, and he does not shrink from the comparison. The Trojan captives judge Odysseus the greater threat. Ajax, consumed by rage, refuses food and sleep. He arms himself, planning to burn the ships and slaughter the Argives — but [Athena](../deities/athena.md) strikes him with madness, out of her love for Odysseus. He slaughters sheep, believing them Greeks. Standing over a ram he believes is Odysseus, he mocks: "Lie there in dust; be meat for dogs and kites!" Athena lifts the madness; Ajax sees the sheep and is "sore amazed." He laments: "Why do the Gods abhor me so?" Then "he thrust the sword of Hector through his throat" and fell "like Typhon, when the bolts of Zeus had blasted him." Teucer mourns him; [Tecmessa](../heroes/tecmessa.md) wails over the corpse. Agamemnon promises to protect her and their son Eurysaces. Odysseus speaks with genuine remorse: "Would to God that ne'er yon Trojans... had crowned me with that victory." Ajax is burned on a pyre, his bones placed in a golden casket, and a mound raised beside Rhoeteium's headland.

### Book VI: Eurypylus

[Menelaus](../heroes/menelaus.md), testing the Greeks, proposes abandoning the war now that [Achilles](../heroes/achilles.md) and [Ajax](../heroes/ajax.md) are dead. [Diomedes](../heroes/diomedes.md) furiously rebukes him. Calchas prophesies Troy will fall in the tenth year and proposes sending for Achilles' son. [Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md) volunteers to go with Diomedes to Scyros. Menelaus promises [Hermione](../heroes/hermione.md) as bride for [Neoptolemus](../heroes/neoptolemus.md). Meanwhile, Eurypylus arrives at Troy — grandson of [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md) through Telephus, and [Priam](../heroes/priam.md)'s nephew through Astyoche. He comes with a great Ceteian host from the land by the river Caicus. [Paris](../heroes/paris.md) welcomes him as kin. His shield bears all the labours of Heracles in elaborate detail. In battle he kills Nireus (the most beautiful Greek after Achilles) and Machaon the healer (son of [Asclepius](../deities/asclepius.md)), driving through his breast. Machaon's brother Podaleirius, learning of his death, arms and fights in a rage of grief. The Greeks recover the bodies but are routed to their ships. Night saves the fleet from burning.

### Book VII: Neoptolemus Fetched from Scyros

Machaon and Nireus are buried under one mound. Podaleirius attempts suicide from grief but [Nestor](../heroes/nestor.md) dissuades him, speaking of his own son [Antilochus](../heroes/antilochus.md)' death. Eurypylus continues his rampage, killing Peneleos and driving the Greeks behind their wall. On Scyros, [Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md) and [Diomedes](../heroes/diomedes.md) find [Neoptolemus](../heroes/neoptolemus.md) practising war before his palace — they marvel at his resemblance to [Achilles](../heroes/achilles.md). Odysseus offers him his father's arms and describes the shield of [Hephaestus](../deities/hephaestus.md). Neoptolemus eagerly agrees to come. His mother Deidameia pleads desperately, reminding him that his mighty father died through these same men's counsels. Neoptolemus replies: "No man is in war beyond his destiny slain." His grandfather Lycomedes warns of sea-perils. Deidameia's grief is compared to a swallow mourning lost nestlings. On arriving at Troy, Neoptolemus dons his father's arms — "he seemed Achilles' self." Old Phoenix weeps with joy and grief at the resemblance. [Agamemnon](../heroes/agamemnon.md) hails him as his father reborn.

### Book VIII: Eurypylus Slain by Neoptolemus

Neoptolemus rides into battle on Achilles' immortal horses, driven by Automedon. Eurypylus and Neoptolemus meet — Eurypylus challenges him; Neoptolemus identifies himself as "Achilles' son, son of the man whose long spear smote thy sire." They fight like lions: Eurypylus hurls a stone that cannot move the son of Achilles, then they duel with spears. The Pelian lance passes clean through Eurypylus' throat. Neoptolemus strips the armour bearing Heracles' labours and routs the Trojans into their city. [Ares](../deities/ares.md) descends with his terrible horses (Red-fire, Flame, Tumult, Panic-fear) to rally the Trojans. Helenus recognises the god's voice and urges courage. Neoptolemus fights on undaunted. Ares would have attacked him directly, but [Athena](../deities/athena.md) swoops from Olympus to Ida, and Zeus's thunder separates them — Ares retreats to Thrace, Athena to Athens. Ganymede pleads with [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) not to let him see Troy destroyed; Zeus veils the city in cloud and darkness, and the Greeks withdraw. [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md) charms weariness from Neoptolemus' limbs.

### Book IX: Return of Philoctetes

Antenor prays to [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) in despair. The Trojans bury Eurypylus before the Dardanian Gate by the Xanthus. Neoptolemus visits Achilles' tomb and weeps. [Deiphobus](../heroes/deiphobus.md) rallies the Trojans with a speech about fighting for home and family. [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) descends to aid Troy; [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) warns Apollo away from killing Neoptolemus, threatening to open a chasm beneath Ilium. Apollo retreats. By Calchas' counsel, the Greeks send Odysseus and Diomedes to fetch [Philoctetes](../heroes/philoctetes.md) from Lemnos. They find him in a cave, wasted and tormented by the venomous wound from the water-snake. He nearly shoots them with [Heracles](../heroes/heracles.md)' bow, but [Athena](../deities/athena.md) dissolves his rage. They bring him to the ships. Podaleirius heals his wound instantly with salves, invoking [Asclepius](../deities/asclepius.md); Athena sheds stature and grace upon him. [Agamemnon](../heroes/agamemnon.md) apologises and gives rich gifts. Philoctetes forgives freely.

### Book X: Death of Paris

[Aeneas](../heroes/aeneas.md) rejects Polydamas' counsel to shelter behind the walls, arguing they should fight in the open. Strife incarnate stalks the battlefield. Neoptolemus slays twelve named warriors. [Philoctetes](../heroes/philoctetes.md) fights in Heracles' arms — his belt depicts Hermes slaying Argus, Phaethon's fall, Perseus killing Medusa, and Prometheus on Caucasus. Paris and Philoctetes face each other with bows. Paris' first arrow kills Cleodorus beside Philoctetes. Philoctetes' first arrow grazes Paris' wrist; the second lodges between flank and groin. Paris flees the battle. Through the night his agony grows unbearable — the venom crawls through his bones. He goes to Mount Ida to beg [Oenone](../heroes/oenone.md), his first wife, to heal him: "O reverenced wife, turn not from me in hate... the strong Fates dragged me to Helen." She refuses bitterly: "Thou comest unto me!—thou, who didst leave erewhile a wailing wife in a desolate home!" She drives him away. [Hera](../deities/hera.md) watches from Olympus as Paris dies on Ida. Nymphs and herdsmen mourn him. [Hecuba](../heroes/hecuba.md) wails; [Helen](../heroes/helen.md) mourns outwardly but mostly fears for herself. Oenone, overcome by grief and guilt, runs through the night to Paris' pyre and leaps onto the flames, clasping his body. Their ashes mingle; the shepherds raise a tomb with two pillars "that each from other ever turn away; for the old jealousy in the marble lives."

### Book XI: Last Battles from the Walls

Without Paris, the Trojans are pressed hard. Neoptolemus and [Philoctetes](../heroes/philoctetes.md) continue their rampages; [Aeneas](../heroes/aeneas.md), Deiphobus, and Eurymachus fight fiercely for Troy. [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) appears in disguise to encourage Aeneas and Eurymachus, filling them with divine strength. They rout the Greeks. Neoptolemus rallies the Argives: "Cravens, why flee, like starlings nothing-worth?" [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md) turns Neoptolemus' fury away from Aeneas out of respect for [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md). [Athena](../deities/athena.md) arrives and tips the battle for the Greeks; Aphrodite snatches Aeneas from the field. The Trojans retreat within the walls. The Greeks assault Troy's gates from multiple directions: Neoptolemus at the Idaean Gate, [Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md) and Eurypylus at the plain-facing gates, Teucer by the Simois. Odysseus forms a testudo of locked shields. Aeneas defends the walls with terrible strength, hurling boulders that shatter the shield-formation, with [Ares](../deities/ares.md) secretly at his side. Philoctetes shoots at Aeneas but Aphrodite deflects the arrow. The Locrian Alcimedon climbs a ladder to the battlements but Aeneas dashes a stone on his head and he falls to his death.

### Book XII: The Wooden Horse

Calchas recounts an omen of a falcon and a dove, counselling stratagem over force. [Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md) proposes the Wooden Horse: the mightiest Greeks will hide inside while the fleet sails to Tenedos; a brave unknown man will remain outside with a false story about a votive offering to [Athena](../deities/athena.md). Neoptolemus and Philoctetes protest — brave men fight face to face — but Odysseus persuades them: even Achilles could not take Troy by force. Zeus hurls a thunderbolt to confirm Calchas' prophecy; they obey. Athena appears to Epeius in a dream, commanding him to build the Horse. In three days it is finished. Sinon volunteers to stay behind. [Nestor](../heroes/nestor.md) wishes he could enter the Horse himself; Neoptolemus enters first. The catalogue: Neoptolemus, [Menelaus](../heroes/menelaus.md), Odysseus, Sthenelus, Diomedes, Philoctetes, Menestheus, Anticlus, Thoas, Polypoetes, Ajax (Locrian), Eurypylus, Thrasymedes, Idomeneus, Meriones, Podaleirius, Eurymachus, Teucer, Ialmenus, Thalpius, Antimachus, Leonteus, Eumelus, Euryalus, Amphimachus, Demophoon, Agapenor, Acamas, Meges, and more. Epeius enters last, closing the mechanism. The fleet sails to Tenedos under Nestor and [Agamemnon](../heroes/agamemnon.md). The Trojans find the Horse and torture Sinon — cutting off his ears and nose — but [Hera](../deities/hera.md) gives him endurance. He tells his prepared tale. Laocoon urges burning the Horse; Athena strikes him blind. The Trojans drag the Horse inside, breaking down their own walls to fit it through. Ill omens multiply: sacrificial victims will not burn, drink-offerings turn to blood, statues weep, wolves howl within the gates. [Cassandra](../heroes/cassandra.md) prophesies doom — "Fools! ye know not your doom" — and tries to attack the Horse with an axe and torch, but the Trojans restrain her. Athena sends two serpents from the isle of Calydna to devour Laocoon's sons before his sightless eyes.

### Book XIII: The Sack of Troy

The Trojans feast drunkenly. At midnight Sinon lifts a torch; the fleet returns from Tenedos. Odysseus opens the Horse; the warriors descend like wasps and seize the gates. The army pours into Troy. The sack is horrifically described: men with bowels hanging from gashes, women torn from beds, babies hurled from ramparts. [Diomedes](../heroes/diomedes.md) kills Coroebus (Cassandra's suitor who arrived only yesterday) and old Ilioneus despite his plea for mercy. Neoptolemus kills Pammon, Polites, and Antiphonus — all sons of [Priam](../heroes/priam.md) — then [Agenor](../heroes/agenor.md). He finds Priam at the altar of Zeus the Hearth-lord. Priam begs to die: "slay me, and pity not my misery... would that thy sire had slain me when I brought him ransom for Hector." Neoptolemus beheads him "lightly as when a reaper lops an ear." [Astyanax](../heroes/astyanax.md) is torn from [Andromache](../heroes/andromache.md)'s arms and hurled from the walls. Andromache is taken captive. [Antenor](../heroes/antenor.md)'s house alone is spared — repayment for sheltering Menelaus and Odysseus. [Aeneas](../heroes/aeneas.md) fights through the night, then, seeing Troy lost, carries his father [Anchises](../heroes/anchises.md) on his shoulders and leads his young son [Ascanius](../heroes/ascanius.md) by the hand; Calchas bids the Greeks let them pass, prophesying Aeneas will found a city by the Tiber. [Menelaus](../heroes/menelaus.md) kills [Deiphobus](../heroes/deiphobus.md) in Helen's bower. He finds [Helen](../heroes/helen.md) and nearly kills her, but [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md) strikes the sword from his hand and rekindles his love; [Agamemnon](../heroes/agamemnon.md) also urges restraint. Locrian Ajax rapes [Cassandra](../heroes/cassandra.md) in Athena's temple; the goddess turns away in shame and rage. Demophoon and Acamas find their grandmother Aethra (Theseus' mother) among the captives. Laodice, Priam's daughter, prays to be swallowed by the earth and is granted her wish. Electra the Pleiad veils herself in mist and departs the sisterhood.

### Book XIV: The Greek Departure

At dawn the Greeks plunder Troy. The captive women are distributed: [Cassandra](../heroes/cassandra.md) to [Agamemnon](../heroes/agamemnon.md), [Andromache](../heroes/andromache.md) to Neoptolemus, [Hecuba](../heroes/hecuba.md) to [Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md). [Helen](../heroes/helen.md) walks veiled beside [Menelaus](../heroes/menelaus.md), shamed but still so beautiful that no man dares reproach her. Achilles' shade appears to Neoptolemus in a dream, telling him he dwells among the gods on the Elysian Plain. He demands [Polyxena](../heroes/polyxena.md) be sacrificed at his tomb, threatening to stir storms if refused. Neoptolemus tells the host; a storm confirms the demand. Polyxena is led to the tomb and slain by Neoptolemus. Hecuba wails, then is transformed into a stone dog — "a mighty marvel for men yet unborn." Calchas warns against sailing, foreseeing the disaster at Cape Caphereus, but only Amphilochus stays with him. The fleet departs. Menelaus and Helen are reconciled; she claims she was taken against her will. Near Euboea, Athena obtains Zeus's thunderbolts and armour (the Aegis with Medusa's head). She sends Iris to Aeolus to unleash all the winds. A catastrophic storm destroys much of the fleet. Locrian Ajax clings to the Gyraean Rock but [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) shatters it with an earthquake and buries him. Nauplius (father of Palamedes) lures ships onto Capherean rocks with false beacon-fires. Poseidon, Apollo, and Zeus together destroy the Greek wall at Troy with flood and earthquake until no trace remains.
