## Overview

The *Posthomerica* (also known as *The Fall of Troy*) fills the narrative gap between Homer's [Iliad](iliad.md) and [Odyssey](odyssey.md), covering the final events of the [Trojan War](../events/trojan-war.md): the coming and death of [Penthesilea](../heroes/penthesilea.md) and Memnon, the death of [Achilles](../heroes/achilles.md), the contest for his arms and [Ajax](../heroes/ajax.md)'s suicide, the fetching of [Neoptolemus](../heroes/neoptolemus.md) and [Philoctetes](../heroes/philoctetes.md), the Wooden Horse, the sack of Troy, and the disastrous Greek departure. Quintus explicitly modelled his work on Homer and claimed to have begun composing poetry while shepherding near Smyrna.

## Contents

### Book I: Penthesilea

[Penthesilea](../heroes/penthesilea.md), daughter of [Ares](../deities/ares.md), comes to Troy from the Thermodon with twelve Amazon companions, fleeing pollution for having accidentally killed her sister [Hippolyte](../heroes/hippolyte.md). [Priam](../heroes/priam.md) welcomes her; she promises to kill [Achilles](../heroes/achilles.md). [Athena](../deities/athena.md) sends a deceitful dream encouraging her. She arms in splendid armour given by Ares and routs the Greeks while Achilles and Ajax mourn at [Patroclus](../heroes/patroclus.md)' tomb. The Trojan women, inspired by Tisiphone's speech, nearly join the battle but are dissuaded by Theano. Achilles and Ajax finally enter the fight and turn the tide. Penthesilea's spears shatter against Achilles' divine armour. He kills her with one thrust through horse and rider. Removing her helmet, he is struck with remorse at her beauty — [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md) caused this by design. Thersites mocks him; Achilles kills Thersites with a single blow. [Diomedes](../heroes/diomedes.md) nearly fights Achilles over the killing (Thersites was his kinsman). Priam buries Penthesilea with honour beside Laomedon's tomb. [Ares](../deities/ares.md) swoops from Olympus to avenge his daughter but is turned back by [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md)'s thunderbolts.
