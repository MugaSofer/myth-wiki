## Overview

The *Posthomerica* (also known as *The Fall of Troy*) fills the narrative gap between Homer's [Iliad](iliad.md) and [Odyssey](odyssey.md), covering the final events of the [Trojan War](../events/trojan-war.md): the coming and death of [Penthesilea](../heroes/penthesilea.md) and Memnon, the death of [Achilles](../heroes/achilles.md), the contest for his arms and [Ajax](../heroes/ajax.md)'s suicide, the fetching of [Neoptolemus](../heroes/neoptolemus.md) and [Philoctetes](../heroes/philoctetes.md), the Wooden Horse, the sack of Troy, and the disastrous Greek departure. Quintus explicitly modelled his work on Homer and claimed to have begun composing poetry while shepherding near Smyrna.

## Contents

### Book I: Penthesilea

[Penthesilea](../heroes/penthesilea.md), daughter of [Ares](../deities/ares.md), comes to Troy from the Thermodon with twelve Amazon companions, fleeing pollution for having accidentally killed her sister [Hippolyte](../heroes/hippolyte.md). [Priam](../heroes/priam.md) welcomes her; she promises to kill [Achilles](../heroes/achilles.md). [Athena](../deities/athena.md) sends a deceitful dream encouraging her. She arms in splendid armour given by Ares and routs the Greeks while Achilles and Ajax mourn at [Patroclus](../heroes/patroclus.md)' tomb. The Trojan women, inspired by Tisiphone's speech, nearly join the battle but are dissuaded by Theano. Achilles and Ajax finally enter the fight and turn the tide. Penthesilea's spears shatter against Achilles' divine armour. He kills her with one thrust through horse and rider. Removing her helmet, he is struck with remorse at her beauty — [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md) caused this by design. Thersites mocks him; Achilles kills Thersites with a single blow. [Diomedes](../heroes/diomedes.md) nearly fights Achilles over the killing (Thersites was his kinsman). Priam buries Penthesilea with honour beside Laomedon's tomb. [Ares](../deities/ares.md) swoops from Olympus to avenge his daughter but is turned back by [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md)'s thunderbolts.

### Book II: Memnon

Thymoetes despairs and urges the Trojans to flee or submit, but [Priam](../heroes/priam.md) counsels waiting for [Memnon](../heroes/memnon.md), son of [Eos](../deities/eos.md) (Dawn), who is coming with a vast Aethiopian host. Polydamas wisely suggests returning [Helen](../heroes/helen.md) and paying double restitution, but [Paris](../heroes/paris.md) reviles him and silences the assembly. Memnon arrives — giantlike, with a countless host. [Priam](../heroes/priam.md) feasts him and pledges him a golden cup (an heirloom from [Hephaestus](../deities/hephaestus.md) through [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md), Dardanus, Erichthonius, Tros, Ilus, and Laomedon). Memnon modestly declines to boast, saying battle will prove his worth. On Olympus, Zeus warns the gods that many will die and none should petition him. At dawn, battle is joined. [Achilles](../heroes/achilles.md) and Memnon both slaughter foes. Memnon kills [Antilochus](../heroes/antilochus.md), son of [Nestor](../heroes/nestor.md), above the breast. Nestor challenges Memnon but is spared — Memnon reverences his age. Nestor summons Achilles, who confronts Memnon. They exchange long boasts (Memnon claiming Dawn's superiority over [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md), Achilles defending Thetis' honour). They fight with swords, both using Hephaestus-forged shields; the Fates appear — one dark beside Memnon, one bright beside Achilles. Achilles drives his sword beneath Memnon's breastbone. The Winds (Breathings of the Dawn) carry Memnon's body to the stream of Aesopus; his blood drops become a river that turns to blood once a year. [Eos](../deities/eos.md) descends with the twelve Horae and the Pleiads to mourn. She threatens to stop bringing light; Zeus thunders to compel her. The Aethiopians are transformed into birds ("the Memnons") that still fight around his tomb. Dawn resumes her course.

### Book III: Death of Achilles

After [Antilochus](../heroes/antilochus.md)' burial, [Achilles](../heroes/achilles.md) arms for vengeance and drives the Trojans to their walls. [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) descends and commands him to withdraw: "Back from the Trojans, Peleus' son!" Achilles defies the god. Apollo, wrapping himself in cloud, shoots an arrow that strikes Achilles' ankle. He reels and falls "like a tower" but continues to fight, killing Orythaon, Hipponous, and Alcathous even as his strength fails. Standing on his spear, he shouts a last defiance; then falls "as fails a beetling mountain-cliff." [Paris](../heroes/paris.md) urges the Trojans to seize the body for Hector's horses. [Ajax](../heroes/ajax.md) bestrides the corpse and fights off Glaucus, [Aeneas](../heroes/aeneas.md), Agenor, and others; he kills Glaucus over Achilles' body. [Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md) fights beside him. Ajax routs the entire Trojan host back to the walls. [Hera](../deities/hera.md) upbraids Apollo for killing the son of [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md), reminding him he sang at Peleus' wedding and prayed for the child. [Athena](../deities/athena.md) preserves the body with ambrosia, giving it a stern frown like the living Achilles. Briseis laments him as her lord and protector. The [Nereids](../deities/groups/nymphs.md) rise from the sea; the [Muses](../deities/groups/muses.md) come from Helicon. Thetis clasps the body, threatening to go to Zeus. Calliope consoles her: even her son Orpheus died; Fate spares no one; but minstrels shall sing Achilles' glory forever. The pyre is built from Ida's timber; Zeus rains ambrosia; Hermes summons the Winds from Aeolus. The bones, unmistakable and gigantic, are placed in a silver casket inside a golden vase (gift of [Dionysus](../deities/dionysus.md), wrought by Hephaestus). A barrow is raised at the Hellespont. Achilles' immortal horses (born of Podarge and the West Wind) mourn but stay, fated to serve [Neoptolemus](../heroes/neoptolemus.md) next. [Poseidon](../deities/poseidon.md) rises and consoles Thetis: Achilles will not stay in Hades but dwell with the gods; Poseidon will give him a holy island in the Euxine Sea.

### Book IV: Funeral Games of Achilles

[Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) catches Glaucus' body from his pyre and sends the Winds to carry him to Lycia, where nymphs create a spring called Glaucus. The Trojans rejoice at Achilles' death; the Argives mourn. [Hera](../deities/hera.md) rebukes [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) for helping Troy; Zeus sits brooding, planning both Troy's destruction and the Greeks' disastrous return. [Thetis](../deities/thetis.md) rises from the sea to set funeral games. [Nestor](../heroes/nestor.md) sings of Peleus' wedding and Achilles' deeds — wins horses that Telephus had given Achilles. Events: footrace (Locrian [Ajax](../heroes/ajax.md) defeats Teucer), wrestling ([Diomedes](../heroes/diomedes.md) defeats [Ajax](../heroes/ajax.md) son of Telamon by craft), boxing (Idomeneus defeats Thoas), archery (Teucer defeats Meriones), javelin (Agamemnon wins by consent), discus ([Ajax](../heroes/ajax.md) wins), and others. Thetis then sets down Achilles' divine arms as the final prize for whoever best rescued the body.

### Book V: Madness and Death of Ajax

[Ajax](../heroes/ajax.md) and [Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md) both claim [Achilles](../heroes/achilles.md)' arms. [Nestor](../heroes/nestor.md) advises against judging themselves, proposing Trojan captives as impartial judges — "they will pass true judgment on these twain, to neither showing favour, since they hate alike all authors of their misery." Ajax makes a passionate speech claiming superiority in battle: he stood against Hector, he saved the ships, he bore Achilles' body while Odysseus cowered. Odysseus counters with wit: brute strength alone does not win wars; his counsel captured Troy's allies, and he does not shrink from the comparison. The Trojan captives judge Odysseus the greater threat. Ajax, consumed by rage, refuses food and sleep. He arms himself, planning to burn the ships and slaughter the Argives — but [Athena](../deities/athena.md) strikes him with madness, out of her love for Odysseus. He slaughters sheep, believing them Greeks. Standing over a ram he believes is Odysseus, he mocks: "Lie there in dust; be meat for dogs and kites!" Athena lifts the madness; Ajax sees the sheep and is "sore amazed." He laments: "Why do the Gods abhor me so?" Then "he thrust the sword of Hector through his throat" and fell "like Typhon, when the bolts of Zeus had blasted him." Teucer mourns him; [Tecmessa](../heroes/tecmessa.md) wails over the corpse. Agamemnon promises to protect her and their son Eurysaces. Odysseus speaks with genuine remorse: "Would to God that ne'er yon Trojans... had crowned me with that victory." Ajax is burned on a pyre, his bones placed in a golden casket, and a mound raised beside Rhoeteium's headland.
