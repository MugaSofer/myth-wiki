## Overview

**Ajax** (Greek: *Aias*) is a tragedy by Sophocles dramatising the final hours of [Ajax](../heroes/ajax.md) son of Telamon. The play opens after the judgment of [Achilles](../heroes/achilles.md)' arms has already gone to [Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md), and Ajax has already carried out his night attack on the Greek livestock, believing them to be the Greek commanders. [Athena](../deities/athena.md) has driven him mad, redirecting his vengeance from men to animals.

The play falls into two halves: the first follows Ajax from madness through lucidity to suicide; the second is a dispute over whether his body deserves burial, resolved by Odysseus's unexpected magnanimity.

## Contents

### Prologue (Athena, Odysseus, Ajax)

[Athena](../deities/athena.md) reveals to [Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md) what has happened in the night. Ajax planned to slaughter the Greek commanders in revenge for the arms judgment, but Athena deflected his fury onto the camp's livestock. She has brought some animals back to his tent to torture, believing them to be his enemies. Athena summons the still-deranged Ajax to display his madness to Odysseus. Despite being Ajax's chief rival, Odysseus responds with pity rather than triumph: "I pity him, for all that he is my foe."

Athena draws a moral: "See then, and utter thou no swelling speech against the gods, nor take upon thee any boast of pride, though thou prevail in might of hand, or height of deep-piled wealth. A day can press down all things human, and a day can raise them up. The wise of heart are those whom Heaven loves, but the perverse are hated."

### Parodos and First Episode (Chorus, Tecmessa)

The chorus of Salaminian sailors, Ajax's followers, enters expressing fear over the rumours. [Tecmessa](../heroes/tecmessa.md), Ajax's captive-wife, describes the night's events: Ajax left armed in the darkness, returned dragging sheep and cattle, tortured them inside the tent thinking them Odysseus and the Atreidae, then suddenly came to his senses surrounded by slaughter.

### Ajax's Lament

Ajax emerges from the tent amid the carnage. His first words are "Darkness! my only light!" — he calls on death and darkness, feeling utterly dishonoured. He laments that his father [Telamon](../heroes/telamon.md) won glory at Troy, but he, who came "with no less might," returns in disgrace. He considers his options — he cannot go home to face his father, cannot fight on at Troy — and resolves on death.

### The Deception Speech

Ajax emerges again and appears to have changed his mind, speaking of yielding to the gods and to time. He speaks of going to wash his stain by the sea-shore and burying his sword. The chorus rejoices, but the speech is deliberately ambiguous — Ajax is in fact preparing for suicide while using language that sounds like reconciliation.

### Ajax's Suicide

Alone on the seashore, Ajax plants [Hector](../heroes/hector.md)'s sword in the earth and speaks his final words. He calls on [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md) to send [Teucer](../heroes/teucer.md) first to find his body. He invokes [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md) to grant him easy passage to death, the [Erinyes](../creatures/erinyes.md) to punish the Atreidae, and [Helius](../deities/helius.md) to carry word to his parents. His last words address the light, Salamis, [Athens](../places/athens.md), and [Troy](../places/troy.md): "O fair light! O sacred fields of Salamis my home!" He falls on the sword.

### Discovery and Lament

[Tecmessa](../heroes/tecmessa.md) finds the body and covers it. [Teucer](../heroes/teucer.md) arrives and laments his brother, reflecting that the sword that killed Ajax was [Hector](../heroes/hector.md)'s gift from their duel — and the belt Ajax gave Hector was the one by which Achilles dragged Hector's body. Teucer worries about returning to [Telamon](../heroes/telamon.md) without his brother, fearing banishment.

### The Burial Dispute

[Menelaus](../heroes/menelaus.md) arrives and forbids burial, calling Ajax an insubordinate enemy. Teucer defies him, asserting Ajax came to Troy as a free man, not Menelaus's subject. They exchange threats and insults.

[Agamemnon](../heroes/agamemnon.md) then arrives and insults Teucer's birth — his mother [Hesione](../heroes/hesione.md) was a captive princess — calling him the son of a "she-captive" and a "barbarian." Teucer defends both his lineage and Ajax's record: Ajax saved the fleet when Hector reached the ships, and fought Hector in single combat by the lottery's choice.

### Odysseus's Intervention

[Odysseus](../heroes/odysseus.md) arrives and, to everyone's surprise, argues that Ajax deserves burial. He tells Agamemnon: "Be not so hard thus without ruth tombless to cast him forth; nor be so vanquished by a vehement will, that to thy hate even Justice' self must bow." Though Ajax was his worst enemy, Odysseus declares: "save Achilles' self, I have not seen so noble an Argive on the fields of Troy."

When Agamemnon protests, Odysseus insists: "Hatred gives way to magnanimity." Agamemnon yields reluctantly, attributing the kindness entirely to Odysseus. Teucer praises Odysseus — "best of men" — but declines his offer to help with the actual rites, fearing it might offend Ajax's spirit. Odysseus accepts gracefully and departs.

### Burial Preparations

Teucer directs the burial, commanding Ajax's son [Eurysakes](../heroes/eurysakes.md) to help lift the body. The chorus closes with a reflection on human ignorance of fate: "Weak is human prophecy. / Judge not, till the hour have taught thee / What the destinies have brought thee."
