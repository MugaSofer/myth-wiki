## Overview

Euripides' *Electra* retells the story of [Orestes](../heroes/orestes.md) and [Electra](../heroes/electra.md) avenging their father [Agamemnon](../heroes/agamemnon.md) by killing [Aegisthus](../heroes/aegisthus.md) and [Clytemnestra](../heroes/clytemnestra.md). Unlike Aeschylus's [Libation-Bearers](aeschylus-libation-bearers.md) or Sophocles' [Electra](sophocles-electra.md), Euripides sets the action in rural poverty — Electra has been married to a peasant farmer to prevent her bearing a son of noble blood. The play is a psychologically searching treatment that questions the justice of the matricide and the god who commanded it.

Notably, Euripides subverts the recognition tokens from Aeschylus: Electra dismisses matching hair, footprints, and weaving as unreliable. Instead, the Old Man recognises Orestes by a childhood scar.

## Contents

### Prologue (1-166)

A Peasant explains the situation: [Agamemnon](../heroes/agamemnon.md) was murdered; [Orestes](../heroes/orestes.md) was spirited away to Phocis; [Electra](../heroes/electra.md) was married to the Peasant by [Aegisthus](../heroes/aegisthus.md) to prevent her bearing noble children. The Peasant has never consummated the marriage out of respect for her royal blood.

### Electra's Lament and Orestes' Arrival (167-431)

Electra mourns at dawn. Orestes arrives incognito with [Pylades](../heroes/pylades.md), claiming to carry news from her brother. He tests her mood — she declares she would kill [Clytemnestra](../heroes/clytemnestra.md) with the same axe that killed her father: "Let me shed my mother's blood, and I die happy."

### Recognition Scene (487-584)

An Old Man (Agamemnon's former servant) reports finding a sacrifice and shorn hair at Agamemnon's tomb. He suggests comparing hair and footprints, but Electra dismisses each token. When the Old Man sees Orestes face to face, he recognises a childhood scar on his brow.

### The Plot (585-698)

The Old Man reports that Aegisthus is sacrificing to the Nymphs on the pastures, with only household servants. They plot: Orestes will kill Aegisthus at the sacrifice; Electra will lure Clytemnestra with a false message that she has given birth.

### Choral Ode: Achilles' Shield (432-486)

The Chorus sings of the Greek ships sailing to Troy, and describes [Achilles](../heroes/achilles.md)' shield — featuring [Perseus](../heroes/perseus.md) with the Gorgon's head, [Hermes](../deities/hermes.md) as companion, the sun, the Pleiades and Hyades, sphinxes, and a lion.

### Choral Ode: The Golden Lamb (699-746)

The Chorus tells the myth of the golden lamb: [Pan](../deities/pan.md) brought a golden-fleeced lamb to Atreus as a sign of kingship, but Thyestes stole it by seducing Atreus's wife, and Zeus reversed the course of the sun in response.

### The Killing of Aegisthus (Messenger Speech, 774-858)

Aegisthus invites the disguised Orestes to his sacrifice. While Aegisthus examines the bull's entrails and finds ominous signs (no liver lobe, strange gall), Orestes strikes from behind with a cleaver, severing spine and brain. The household servants recognise him and submit.

### Electra's Speech Over the Body (907-956)

Electra delivers a long tirade over Aegisthus's corpse — he killed her father, was vain about his looks ("that girl-like face"), was always called "the Queen's husband" not "the King," and lived in constant fear.

### Clytemnestra's Arrival and Defence (998-1096)

Clytemnestra arrives, lured by the false message. She defends herself: Agamemnon sacrificed [Iphigenia](../heroes/iphigenia.md) for [Helen](../heroes/helen.md)'s sake, then brought [Cassandra](../heroes/cassandra.md) home as concubine. She would not have killed him for Iphigenia alone, but the insult of Cassandra drove her to it.

### Electra's Rebuttal (1060-1096)

Electra argues that Clytemnestra was primping at the mirror before any wrong was done, and that even if Agamemnon's death were justified, it doesn't explain the mistreatment of his children.

### The Matricide (1165-1232)

Orestes hesitates — "How if some fiend of Hell, / Hid in God's likeness, spake that oracle?" Electra pushes him. The killing happens offstage; Clytemnestra's cry is heard. Orestes killed her with his face veiled: "I lifted over mine eyes / My mantle: blinded I smote."

### Lament (1177-1232)

Both siblings are shattered. Orestes describes Clytemnestra baring her breast and bending her knees; Electra describes her mother's hand clinging to her cheek. They cover her body together.

### The Dioscuri (1233-1359)

[Castor](../heroes/castor.md) and [Polydeuces](../heroes/polydeuces.md) appear as deus ex machina. Castor declares Clytemnestra's doom "righteous" but criticises Apollo: "though in light he dwell, no light was this / He showed to thee." He decrees: Orestes must flee to Athens, stand trial at the Areopagus, where equal votes will mean acquittal; Electra shall marry Pylades; the Erinyes will pursue Orestes until the trial. Castor also reveals the phantom Helen tradition: Helen never went to Troy — "Twas but a wraith of Helen, sent / By Zeus, to make much wrath and ravishment."
