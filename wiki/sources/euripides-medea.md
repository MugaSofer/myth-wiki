## Overview

Euripides' *Medea* is a tragedy set in Corinth, some years after the events of the Argonaut voyage. [Jason](../heroes/jason.md) has abandoned [Medea](../heroes/medea.md) to marry Glauce, daughter of [Creon](../heroes/creon-corinth.md), king of Corinth. Medea, facing exile, plots and executes a devastating revenge: she sends poisoned gifts that kill the princess and her father, then murders her own children to inflict the deepest possible wound on Jason. She escapes to Athens on a dragon-drawn chariot provided by her grandfather [Helius](../deities/helius.md).

The play is one of the most celebrated Greek tragedies, famous for its psychological depth, its exploration of Medea's conflicted mind, and its unflinching portrayal of the consequences of betrayal.

**Note on names:** The Buckley translation uses Roman names (Jove for [Zeus](../deities/zeus.md), Venus for [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md), Diana for [Artemis](../deities/artemis.md), Juno for [Hera](../deities/hera.md)). The wiki normalizes these to Greek names.

## Contents

### Prologue (Nurse and Tutor)

The Nurse of Medea opens the play lamenting that the [Argo](../objects/argo.md) ever sailed through the Symplegades and that Medea ever came to Iolcos. She recounts how Medea, "deeply smitten in her mind with the love of Jason," betrayed her father and country, persuaded the daughters of Pelias to slay their father, and came to Corinth. Now Jason has betrayed her for a royal marriage. Medea lies prostrate, refusing food, weeping, "as the rock, or the wave of the sea, does she listen to her friends when advised." The Nurse fears Medea may harm herself or others: "violent is her mind."

The Tutor reports that Creon intends to banish Medea and her children.

### Medea's Offstage Cries and the Chorus

Medea cries from within: "Wretch that I am! ... would I might perish!" She curses her children: "O ye accursed children of a hated mother, may ye perish with your father, and may the whole house fall." The Nurse describes her looking at her attendants "with the aspect of a lioness that has just brought forth."

### Medea's Address to the Chorus

Medea emerges and delivers her famous speech on the condition of women: "of all things as many as have life and intellect, we women are the most wretched race." Women must purchase husbands, cannot divorce, must adapt to strangers' ways. She declares: "I would rather thrice stand in arms, than once suffer the pangs of child-birth." She asks the Chorus to keep silent about whatever revenge she plans.

### Creon's Banishment

Creon orders Medea to leave immediately, fearing her wisdom and sorcery. She manipulates him into granting her one day, during which she plans to kill "three of mine enemies" — Creon, the bride, and Jason. She invokes [Hecate](../deities/hecate.md): "I swear by my mistress whom I revere most of all, and have chosen for my assistant, Hecate, who dwells in the inmost recesses of my house."

### Jason and Medea's Confrontation

Jason claims he came to help; Medea accuses him of cowardice and ingratitude. She enumerates her sacrifices: saving him from the fire-breathing bulls, slaying the guardian dragon of the [Golden Fleece](../objects/golden-fleece.md), betraying her father, murdering Pelias. Jason argues that [Aphrodite](../deities/aphrodite.md) was the true savior ("Venus alone both of Gods and men was the protectress of my voyage") and that he married the princess to benefit their family. The Chorus sides with Medea.

### Aegeus Scene

[Aegeus](../heroes/aegeus.md), king of Athens and son of Pandion, arrives from the oracle of [Apollo](../deities/apollo.md) at Delphi, where he sought a cure for his childlessness. The oracle told him cryptically "not to loose the projecting foot of the vessel" before returning home. He is going to Pittheus of Troezen for interpretation. Medea secures his oath — by Earth and by Helius — to shelter her in Athens, promising to cure his childlessness with her knowledge of drugs.

### Medea's Plan

With refuge secured, Medea reveals her full plan: send poisoned gifts (a robe and golden chaplet) to the bride, then kill her own children. "my rage is master of my counsels, which is indeed the cause of the greatest calamities to men."

### The Messenger Speech

The Messenger reports the deaths: Glauce put on the robe and chaplet, admired herself in a mirror, then collapsed. "The golden chaplet placed on her head was sending forth a stream of all-devouring fire," and "the fine-wrought robes were devouring the white flesh of the hapless woman." Her flesh dropped from her bones "as the tear from the pine-tree." Creon embraced his dying daughter and was held fast by the poisoned robes "as the ivy by the boughs of the laurel," tearing his flesh from his bones as he tried to pull free. Both perished.

### The Child-Murder and Finale

Medea steels herself to kill her children despite her anguish. The children cry for help from within. Jason arrives too late. Medea appears above the house on a dragon-drawn chariot given by Helius, her grandfather: "such a chariot the sun my father's father gives me, a defense from the hostile hand." She prophesies Jason's death: "thou shalt die wretchedly, struck on thy head with a relic of thy ship Argo." She will bury the children at the shrine of [Hera](../deities/hera.md) and institute expiatory rites, then go to Athens to dwell with Aegeus. Jason's final appeal to touch his dead children is denied.
