## Overview

**Antigone** dramatizes the conflict between [Antigone](../heroes/antigone.md), daughter of [Oedipus](../heroes/oedipus.md), and [Creon](../heroes/creon.md), king of [Thebes](../places/thebes.md), over the burial of her brother [Polyneices](../heroes/polyneices.md). Creon has decreed that Polyneices, who attacked Thebes, shall lie unburied, while [Eteocles](../heroes/eteocles.md), who defended it, receives full honors. Antigone buries Polyneices in defiance, appeals to divine law over human law, and is condemned to death. The play ends with the suicides of Antigone, [Haemon](../heroes/haemon.md) (Creon's son and Antigone's betrothed), and [Eurydice](../heroes/eurydice-creon.md) (Creon's wife).

## Contents

### Prologue (1-99)

Antigone tells [Ismene](../heroes/ismene.md) of Creon's edict: Eteocles is buried with honor, but Polyneices "must lie unwept, unsepulchred, a feast / Of flesh for keen-eyed carrion birds" (29-30). Antigone asks Ismene to help bury him. Ismene refuses, citing their weakness: "We twain are left; and think how we shall die / More miserably than all the rest, if we / In spite of law shall cross / A monarch's will" (59-62). Antigone resolves to act alone.

### Parodos (100-161)

The Chorus of Theban elders celebrates the city's deliverance from the Argive army, invoking [Dionysus](../deities/dionysus.md): "Come Bacchus, worshipped in Thebes above all, / Lead thy bacchanals' revel at dead of night" (153-154).

### First Episode (162-331)

Creon justifies his edict, arguing the city must honor its defenders and punish its enemies. A guard reports that someone has scattered dust over Polyneices' corpse — the symbolic burial rite.

### Second Episode (332-581)

Antigone is caught performing the rites a second time. Brought before Creon, she delivers her famous defense of divine law: "Nor did I deem thine edicts of such force / That they, a mortal's bidding, should o'erride / Unwritten laws, eternal in the heavens. / Not of today or yesterday are these, / But live from everlasting, and from whence / They sprang, none knoweth" (453-457). Ismene tries to share the blame; Antigone refuses: "Thou didst not consent, and I gave thee no part" (538).

### Third Episode (626-780)

The Chorus sings of the curse on the house of Oedipus: "one generation from another takes the blow, / And no god frees them from the doom of woe" (594-596). Haemon pleads with his father for Antigone's life, arguing the city supports her: "The people mourn this maiden" (693). Creon refuses and decrees Antigone shall be sealed in a rock-hewn tomb alive.

### Fourth Episode (781-943)

Antigone is led to her tomb. She laments that she goes unwed and childless to "the house of Death" (810), comparing herself to Niobe "whom the rock overgrew" (823). She acknowledges the justice in her brother's case: "A husband dead, I might have found another... / But since my father and my mother sleep / In Hades, I can never have / A brother more" (909-912).

### Fifth Episode (988-1114)

[Teiresias](../heroes/tiresias.md) warns Creon that the gods are angry — sacrificial fires will not kindle, birds are maddened with Polyneices' gore: "The altars of the city, one and all, / Have been polluted by the birds and dogs / With carrion from the hapless Polyneices" (1016-1018). He prophesies: "Thou shalt not live through many circling suns / Before thou yield'st a son of thine own loins / In quittance, dead for dead" (1064-1066). Creon relents.

### Exodos (1155-1353)

A messenger reports that Creon went first to bury Polyneices, then to the tomb. There they found Antigone hanged "by the neck, / Suspended by her linen scarf" (1222-1223). Haemon, discovering her, spat in his father's face, drew his sword, missed Creon, and "drove it home / Into his side, and in the arms of her / He clasped so dear, let his life-blood ebb away" (1234-1236). Upon hearing this, [Eurydice](../heroes/eurydice-creon.md) stabs herself at the altar, cursing Creon with her last breath. The Chorus concludes: "Of happiness the chiefest part / Is wisdom, and to hold the gods in awe. / This is the law / That, seeing the stricken heart / Of pride brought down, we learn when we are old" (1348-1353).
